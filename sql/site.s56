Since 1988 the company has put itself in a position to de facto control the Federal Reserve, most Wall Street mega-banks, including Goldman Sachs, the Davos World Economic Forum Great Reset, the Biden Administration and, if left unchecked, the economic future of our world. BlackRock is the epitome of what Mussolini called Corporatism, where an unelected corporate elite dictates top down to the population. </span></em></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">How the world’s largest “shadow bank” exercises this enormous power over the world ought to concern us. BlackRock since Larry Fink founded it in 1988 has managed to assemble unique financial software and assets that no other entity has. BlackRock’s Aladdin risk-management system, a software tool that can track and analyze trading, monitors more than $18 trillion in assets for 200 financial firms including the Federal Reserve and European central banks. He who “monitors” also knows, we can imagine. BlackRock has been called a financial “Swiss Army Knife — institutional investor, money manager, private equity firm, and global government partner <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/blackrock-rules-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rolled into one</a>.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Yet mainstream media treats the company as just another Wall Street financial firm.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">There is a seamless interface that ties the UN Agenda 2030 with the Davos World Economic Forum Great Reset and the nascent economic policies of the Biden Administration. That interface is BlackRock. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Team Biden and BlackRock</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">By now it should be clear to anyone who bothers to look, that the person who claims to be US President, 78-year old Joe Biden, is not making any decisions. He even has difficulty reading a teleprompter or answering prepared questions from friendly media without confusing Syria and Libya or even whether he is President. He is being micromanaged by a group of handlers to maintain a scripted “image” of a President while policy is made behind the scenes by others. It eerily reminds of the 1979 Peter Sellers film character, Chauncey Gardiner, in </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Being There</span><span lang=\"en-US\">. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">What is less public are the key policy persons running economic policy for Biden Inc. They are simply said, BlackRock. Much as Goldman Sachs ran economic policy under Obama and also Trump, today BlackRock is filling that key role. The deal apparently was sealed in January, 2019 when Joe Biden, then-candidate and long-shot chance to defeat Trump, went to meet with Larry Fink in New York, who reportedly told “working class Joe,” that, “<a href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/middle-class-joe-biden-courts-wall-street-oligarch-blackrocks-larry-fink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I’m here to help</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Now as President in one of his first appointees, Biden named Brian Deese to be the Director of the National Economic Council, the President’s main adviser for economic policy. One of the early Presidential Executive Orders dealt with economics and climate policy. That’s not surprising, as Deese came from Fink’s BlackRock where he was Global Head of Sustainable Investing. Before joining BlackRock, Deese held senior economic posts under Obama, including replacing John Podesta as Senior Adviser to the President where he worked alongside Valerie Jarrett. Under Obama, Deese played a key role in <a href=\"https://marketrealist.com/p/wally-adeyemo-blackrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negotiating</a> the Global Warming Paris Accords.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In the key policy post as Deputy Treasury Secretary under Secretary Janet Yellen, we find Nigerian-born Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo. Adeyemo also comes from BlackRock where from 2017 to 2019 he was a senior adviser and Chief of Staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, after leaving the Obama Administration. His <a href=\"https://marketrealist.com/p/wally-adeyemo-blackrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal ties</a> to Obama are strong, as Obama named him the first President of the Obama Foundation in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">And a third senior BlackRock person running economic policy in the Administration now is also unusual in several respects. Michael Pyle is the Senior Economic Adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. He came to Washington from the position as the Global Chief Investment Strategist at BlackRock where he oversaw the strategy for investing some $9 trillion of funds. Before joining BlackRock at the highest level, he had also been in the Obama Administration as a senior adviser to the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and in 2015 <a href=\"https://prospect.org/cabinet-watch/another-blackrock-veteran-will-join-biden-administration-michael-pyle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">became an adviser</a> to the Hillary Clinton presidential bid.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The fact that three of the most influential economic appointees of the Biden Administration come from BlackRock, and before that all from the Obama Administration, is noteworthy. There is a definite pattern and suggests that the role of BlackRock in Washington is far larger than we are being told.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What is BlackRock?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Never before has a financial company with so much influence over world markets been so hidden from public scrutiny. That’s no accident. As it is technically not a bank making bank loans or taking deposits, it evades the regulation oversight from the Federal Reserve even though it does what most mega banks like HSBC or JP MorganChase do—buy, sell securities for profit. When there was a Congressional push to include asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard Funds under the post-2008 Dodd-Frank law as “systemically important financial institutions” or SIFIs, a huge lobbying push from BlackRock ended the threat. BlackRock is essentially a law onto itself. And indeed it is “systemically important” as no other, with possible exception of Vanguard, which is said to also be a major shareholder in BlackRock.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink is clearly interested in buying influence globally. He made former German CDU MP Friederich Merz head of BlackRock Germany when it looked as if he might succeed Chancellor Merkel, and former British Chancellor of Exchequer George Osborne as “political consultant.” Fink named former Hillary Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills to the BlackRock board when it seemed certain Hillary would soon be in the White House. </span></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">He has named former central bankers to his board and gone on to secure lucrative contracts with their former institutions. Stanley Fisher, former head of the Bank of Israel and also later Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve is now Senior Adviser at BlackRock. Philipp Hildebrand, former Swiss National Bank president, is vice chairman at BlackRock, where he oversees the BlackRock Investment Institute. Jean Boivin, the former deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, is the global <a href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-15/blackrock-s-ex-central-bankers-have-bold-vision-to-beat-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">head of research</a> at BlackRock’s investment institute.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock and the Fed</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">It was this ex-central bank team at BlackRock that developed an “emergency” bailout plan for Fed chairman Powell in March 2019 as financial markets appeared on the brink of another 2008 “Lehman crisis” meltdown. As “thank you,” the Fed chairman Jerome Powell named BlackRock in a no-bid role to manage all of the Fed’s corporate bond purchase programs, including bonds where BlackRock itself invests. Conflict of interest? A group of some 30 NGOs wrote to Fed Chairman Powell, “By giving BlackRock full control of this debt buyout program, the Fed… makes BlackRock even more systemically important to the financial system. Yet BlackRock is not subject to the regulatory scrutiny of even smaller systemically <a href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/06/blackrock-authored-the-bailout-plan-before-there-was-a-crisis-now-its-been-hired-by-three-central-banks-to-implement-the-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">important financial institutions</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In a detailed report in 2019, a Washington non-profit research group, Campaign for Accountability, noted that, “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, implemented a strategy of lobbying, campaign contributions, and revolving door hires to fight off government regulation and establish itself as one of the most powerful <a href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/new-report-details-how-blackrock-fought-off-government-regulation-by-spending-big-in-washington/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial companies</a> in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The New York Fed hired BlackRock in March 2019 to manage its commercial mortgage-backed securities program and its $750 billion primary and secondary purchases of corporate bonds and ETFs in no-bid contracts. US financial journalists Pam and Russ Martens in critiquing that murky 2019 Fed bailout of Wall Street remarked, “for the first time in history, the Fed has hired BlackRock to “go direct” and buy up $750 billion in both primary and secondary corporate bonds and bond ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), a product of which BlackRock is one of the largest purveyors in the world.” They went on, “Adding further outrage, the BlackRock-run program will get $75 billion of the $454 billion in taxpayers’ money to eat the losses on its corporate bond purchases, which will include its own ETFs, which the Fed is allowing it to buy…”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Fed head Jerome Powell and Larry Fink know each other well, apparently. Even after Powell gave BlackRock the hugely lucrative no-bid “go direct” deal, Powell continued to have the same BlackRock manage an estimated $25 million of Powell’s private securities investments. Public records show that in this time Powell held direct confidential phone calls with BlackRock CEO Fink. According to required financial disclosure, BlackRock managed to <a href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/08/fed-chair-powell-had-4-private-phone-calls-with-blackrocks-ceo-since-march-as-blackrock-manages-upwards-of-25-million-of-powells-personal-money-and-lands-3-no-bid-deals-with-the-fed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">double the value</a> of Powell’s investments from the year before! No conflict of interest, or?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">A Very BlackRock in Mexico </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock’s murky history in Mexico shows that conflicts of interest and influence-building with leading government agencies is not restricted to just the USA. PRI Presidential candidate Peña Nieto went to Wall Street during his campaign in November 2011. There he met Larry Fink. What followed the Nieto victory in 2012 was a tight relationship between Fink and Nieto that was riddled with <a href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/new-report-details-how-blackrock-built-its-mexican-infrastructure-business-through-cronyism-corruption-and-conflicts-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conflict of interest</a>, cronyism and corruption.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Most likely to be certain BlackRock was on the winning side in the corrupt new Nieto regime, Fink named 52-year-old Marcos Antonio Slim Domit, billionaire son of Mexico’s wealthiest and arguably most corrupt man, Carlos Slim, to BlackRock’s Board. Marcos Antonio, along with his brother Carlos Slim Domit, run the father’s huge business empire today. Carlos Slim Domit, the eldest son, was Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum Latin America in 2015, and currently serves as chairman of the board of America Movil where BlackRock is a major investor. Small cozy world. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The father, Carlos Slim, at the time named by Forbes as World’s Richest Person, built an empire based around his sweetheart acquisition of Telemex (later America Movil). Then President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in effect gifted the telecom empire to Slim in 1989. Salinas later fled Mexico on charges of stealing more than $10 billion from state coffers. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">As with much in Mexico since the 1980s drug money apparently played a huge role with the elder Carlos Slim, father of BlackRock director Marcos Slim. In 2015 WikiLeaks released company internal emails from the private intelligence corporation, Stratfor. Stratfor writes in an April 2011 email, the time BlackRock is establishing its Mexico plans, that a US DEA Special Agent, William F. Dionne confirmed Carlos Slim’s ties to the Mexican drug cartels. Stratfor asks Dionne, “Billy, is the MX (Mexican) billionaire Carlos Slim linked to the narcos?” Dionne replies, “Regarding your <a href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https://www.telesurenglish.net/opinion/The-Mexican-Billionaire-Even-Ex-Presidents-Fear-Talking-About--20151201-0019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">question</a>, the MX telecommunication billionaire is.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">In a country where 44% of the population lives in poverty you don’t become the world’s richest man in just two decades selling Girl Scout cookies. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Fink and Mexican PPP</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">With Marcos Slim on his BlackRock board and new president Enrique Peña Nieto, Larry Fink’s Mexican partner in Nieto Peña’s $590 billion PublicPrivatePartnership (PPP) alliance, BlackRock, was ready to reap the harvest. To fine-tune his new Mexican operations, Fink named former Mexican Undersecretary of Finance Gerardo Rodriguez Regordosa to direct BlackRock Emerging Market Strategy in 2013. Then in 2016 Peña Nieto appointed Isaac Volin, then head of BlackRock Mexico to be No. 2 at PEMEX where he presided over corruption, scandals and the largest loss in PEMEX history, $38 billion. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Peña Nieto had opened the huge oil state monopoly, PEMEX, to private investors for the first time since nationalization in the 1930s. The first to benefit was Fink’s BlackRock. Within seven months, BlackRock had secured $1 billion in PEMEX energy projects, many as the only bidder. During the tenure of Peña Nieto, one of the most controversial and least popular presidents, BlackRock prospered by the cozy ties. It soon was <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/blackrock-rules-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">engaged</a> in highly profitable (and corrupt) infrastructure projects under Peña Nieto including not only oil and gas pipelines and wells but also including toll roads, hospitals, gas pipelines and even prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Notably, BlackRock’s Mexican “friend” Peña Nieto was also “friends” not only with Carlos Slim but with the head of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, “El Chapo” Guzman. In court testimony in 2019 in New York Alex Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo’s “right-hand man,” testified that just after his election in 2012, Peña Nieto had requested $250 million from the Sinaloa Cartel before settling on $100 million. We <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46872414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can only guess</a> what for.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Larry Fink and WEF Great Reset </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In 2019 Larry Fink joined the Board of the Davos World Economic Forum, the Swiss-based organization that for some 40 years has advanced economic globalization. Fink, who is close to the WEF’s technocrat head, Klaus Schwab, of Great Reset notoriety, now stands positioned to use the huge weight of BlackRock to create what is potentially, if it doesn’t collapse before, the world’s largest Ponzi scam, ESG corporate investing. Fink with $9 trillion to leverage is pushing the greatest shift of capital in history into a scam known as ESG Investing. The UN “sustainable economy” agenda is being realized quietly by the very same global banks which have created the financial crises in 2008. This time they are preparing the Klaus Schwab WEF Great Reset by steering hundreds of billions and soon trillions in investment to their hand-picked “woke” companies, and away from the “not woke” such as oil and gas companies or coal. BlackRock since 2018 has been in the forefront to create a new investment infrastructure that picks “winners” or “losers” for investment according to how serious that company is about ESG—Environment, Social values and Governance.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">For example a company gets positive ratings for the seriousness of its hiring gender diverse management and employees, or takes measures to eliminate their carbon “footprint” by making their energy sources green or sustainable to use the UN term. How corporations contribute to a global sustainable governance is the most vague of the ESG, and could include anything from corporate donations to Black Lives Matter to supporting UN agencies such as WHO. Oil companies like ExxonMobil or coal companies no matter how clear are doomed as Fink and friends now promote their financial Great Reset or Green New Deal. This is why he cut a deal with the Biden presidency in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Follow the money. And we can expect that the New York Times will cheer BlackRock on as it destroys the world financial structures. Since 2017 BlackRock has been the paper’s largest shareholder. Carlos Slim was second largest. Even Carl Icahn, a ruthless Wall Street asset stripper, once <a href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/03/icahn-called-blackrock-an-extremely-dangerous-company-the-fed-has-chosen-it-to-manage-its-corporate-bond-bailout-programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called</a> BlackRock, “an extremely dangerous company… I used to say, you know, the mafia has a better code of ethics than you guys.” </span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The Battle of Britain is raging. You and your family are in the midst of 114 days of intense aerial combat. German bombs fall across the countryside along with the flaming wreckage of fighter planes careening to their doom, destroying the world below bit by bit. The scent of smoke and death is mingled into the very clouds.</p>\n<p>You and the lads know that your country is in grave peril. You\'ve just become eligible to join the Royal Air Force and want to immediately be put into service.

About 39% mentioned viewpoint diversity, and even fewer schools, 32%, mention free speech.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Got that?</p>\n<p>While', 'our universities used to be a place for free speech and discussion, they\'re now a place for DEI indoctrination.</p>\n<p>So the old Western idea of a university where one uses science and logic to argue ideas has quite literally been replaced by a propaganda facility which rejects Western thought and essentially anything created by white people.</p>\n<p>Because everything the West created is bad or something.</p>\n<p>More from this article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, the actual amount of DEI content overwhelmingly outpaced the amount of free speech and viewpoint diversity content. For example, the schools had seven times more DEI-themed video material than on free speech or viewpoint diversity, according to the report…</p>\n<p>Among the DEI materials, 27% mentioned bias, 22% mentioned DEI training, 20% mentioned discrimination, 11% mentioned racial equity, 9% mentioned antiracism, another 9% mentioned microaggressions, and 2% mentioned trigger warnings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a nutshell, if your kid is attending one of these fine universities they\'re not being taught how to think, they\'re being taught what to think.</p>\n<p>Don\'t ask <strong>why</strong> there\'s a gender pay gap, listen to the Gender Studies graduate who knows exactly how to fix the problem with she/her\'s diversity and inclusion mechanism.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>Yup, your kids are being indoctrinated in anti-Western ideology.</p>\n<p>Some fun stuff for ya:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Several schools had particularly \"alarming\" examples, the report said.</p>\n<p>Northern Kentucky University encouraged students to attend a drag show and went into detail about microaggressions…</p>\n<p>At the State University of New York (SUNY) at New Paltz, students are required to take an implicit bias test.</p>\n<p>The \"Implicit Association Test\" makes students match faces of different skin colors with negative and positive words, objects, and weapons. Another test makes students match negative and positive words with different gender identities…</p>\n<p>The University of California at Irvine encourages their freshmen students to take the same implicit bias test, but it is not required, the report says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a joke or some conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p>So when your Dem friends or family members try to pull the conspiracy theory argument, you bring \'em on over to Not the Bee or one of the many great actual news outlets on the right, cuz we\'ll show ‘em whatsup.</p>\n<p>Last thing here, because this is where all of this anti-free speech garbage leads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent years, students at many colleges have made a habit of policing speech on campus, both others and even their own.</p>\n<p>Last year, one <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thefire.org/the-2021-college-free-speech-rankings/\">study</a> found that more than 80% of college students in the U.S. actually self-censor their own opinions at their schools.</p>\n<p>About two thirds say they think it is acceptable to shout down a speaker on campus, and nearly a fourth of college students say it is acceptable to use violence to halt certain speech, according to the study from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), College Pulse, and RealClearEducation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dare to use free speech on campus?</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>You better know the consequences.</p>\n<hr class=\"w-32 my-8 border-gray-400\">\n<p>\nP.S.

Though believing them all to be socialist sympathizers, she offered no hesitation in ranking them: </p>\n<ol>\nABC\'s Peter Jennings (he had such a calm demeanor)\nNBC\'s Tom Brokaw (he was pompous but tolerable)\nCBS\'s Dan Rather (he just looked shifty and untrustworthy)\n</ol>\n<p>Needless to say, she was anything but surprised when Rather got canned at CBS for his role in promoting a fabricated news story about George W. Bush\'s record in the Texas Air National Guard, all in the hopes of helping Democrat John Kerry\'s 2004 challenge. </p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3', 'mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"block sm:hidden\" id=\"Notthebee_Player_Mobile\"></div>\n<p>She died several years ago, but I can only imagine what she would say if she was watching Rather\'s shameless dissemination of left-wing propaganda these days on his Twitter feed. </p>\n<p>Not to say that Rather isn\'t entitled to his opinions, extreme as though they may be. It\'s just that those who hold (or who have held) such influential positions as national news anchors seemingly have a responsibility to the public trust to maintain at least the appearance of objectivity.</p>\n<p>But that\'s certainly not the world we live in these days, where narrowcasting and histrionics dominate the news/entertainment fare produced routinely by fame-obsessed, budding media celebrities.</p>\n<p>For instance, this may not be true, but it sure generates hysterical reactions, which translates to clicks, views, and retweets:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"w-full\"><div class=\"w-full\"></div></div></div></div>\n<p>Again, there\'s no state law that even comes close to criminalizing miscarriages – the moral and legal premise doesn\'t even make sense. It\'s not just that pro-life organizations have always carefully distinguished between elective abortion and these medical circumstances involving ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages. It\'s that even if there existed some desire to legislate against them, it would be political suicide. So why run a scare-story about something that isn\'t being discussed, and isn\'t going to happen?</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>Probably for the same reason Forbes magazine would run this headline:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>That might be appalling if that\'s what actually happened. But truthfully the only thing that\'s appalling is a headline like that being constructed to describe the situation that actually occurred. </p>\n<p>An at-home abortion was conducted by a mother on her own 28-week pregnant daughter. The woman killed her own grandchild, delivered the dead baby, burned the child and then buried the remains. She and her daughter then discussed the massacre through direct messages on Facebook, which were secured through a properly obtained search warrant. Knowing the details, go back and read the headline again. It\'s the Dan Ratherization of the news: agenda over accuracy, activism over honesty.</p>\n<p>It\'s why CNN\'s Brian Stelter invited former Biden Press Secretary Jen Psaki on to <i>ask her</i> what the media should do better. It\'s why CBS\'s alleged comedian Stephen Colbert invites the current Biden Press Secretary on to mutually lament why some journalists in the press corps insist on obstinately challenging the administration\'s narrative.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"w-full\"><div class=\"w-full\"></div></div></div></div>\n<p>It\'s never been a necessary job qualification – nor should it be any type of expectation – of the media to agree with the administration\'s narrative of reality. The fact that it has seemingly become one tells you all you need to know about the Ratherized state of modern journalism.</p>\n <hr class=\"w-32 my-8 border-gray-400\">\n<p>\nP.S.

As we\'ve <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://notthebee.com/article/enough-with-the-reboots-we-need-to-start-creating-original-exciting-stories-again\">written here before</a>, Hollywood is in a miserable rut of sequels, reboots and intellectual strip-mining of established properties, so it\'s already a bit of a letdown that we\'re watching yet another Predator movie rather than something new.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"block sm:hidden\" id=\"Notthebee_Player_Mobile\"></div>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"text-left\"></div></div></div>\n<p>Such are the times we live in, however, and so here we are reviewing another entry in what is now a <strong>septenary</strong> series of', 'films. And you will probably not be surprised to learn that this film is not very good. It is without a doubt a pale, ineffective shadow of the magnificent original film, though even on its own merits it stumbles and ultimately falls.</p>\n<p>The premise is kind of more or less the same as the other six films in the franchise: A Predator alien comes to a planet to hunt things. In this case the creature comes to the early-18th century American plains, landing near a Comanche tribe and eventually crossing paths with several of their warriors, including the female protagonist, Naru.</p>\n<p>Violence, bloodshed, mayhem and intense fighting sequences follow. It will not surprise you at all to learn that Naru eventually triumphs over the Predator, killing him and solidifying her status as a great warrior of her tribe. In fact, there is nothing at all surprising about this film. Being the seventh in a 35-year-old film series will do that.</p>\n<p>The film does have its brighter points. The cinematography is often quite appealing, particularly the depiction of the Great Plains of the U.S. prior to widespread colonial and U.S. emigration. Amber Midthunder, who plays Naru, turns in a commendably understated performance; she manages to sell the character\'s irritation of being sidelined in a patriarchal tribe without making it too woke, which is an impressive feat in and of itself. The depiction of the Comanche people is also well done; they appear as relatively normal men and women, anyway, rather than the sort of sainted, whitewashed Nature People that most modern progressives picture Native Americans to have been prior to European contact.</p>\n<p>Yet the movie still mostly bombs. Naru is the only character in the film that even comes close to being fleshed out; every other player in the movie is relegated to largely irrelevant background roles. When you consider how fully dimensional the <strong>seven </strong>main characters of the original film were presented, this lapse feels all the more striking.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>The movie also suffers from that intellectual anemia that afflicts so many modern films. Mere minutes after barely escaping a terrifying attack from the Predator, Naru runs into several of her fellow tribesmen — and yet she seemingly almost forgets to tell them what just happened to her, only mentioning it as a casual afterthought. At one point Naru encounters a French trader who just happens to have come across the Predator, somehow survived the incident, and incredibly figured out that the Predator is a \"hunter\" who is \"looking for the strongest beast.\" It\'s as if screenwriters these days just run with the first idea that pops into their heads without thinking of how bizarre and inexplicable it will play out on-screen.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>The action sequences, meanwhile, have almost the opposite problem: They\'re overwhelmingly <strong>overthought </strong>to an absurdist degree. Consider in the original film how protagonist Dutch just barely defeated the Predator by a sheer stroke of luck after the creature happened to stand under a counterweight while preparing to kill him:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62fa92c307b5d.gif\"></div></div>\n<p>Compare that with Naru\'s rather ridiculous battle against her own adversary, wherein she receives a perfect weapons assist from her Dixie Dog before literally leaping up onto the Predator\'s seven-foot-tall frame to wrap a rope around its neck several times:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62fa9345c6e44.gif\"></div></div>\n<p>It\'s just over-the-top and unbelievable, though the way Naru ultimately defeats the Predator is more patently ridiculous than even this sequence.</p>\n<p>In the end, though it has its small moments, \"Prey\" is ultimately a product of its time, an unserious movie for an unserious age of cinema.

pajamas that spent our years in college learning to be trained monkeys that can churn out propaganda in AP Style.</p>\n<p>In fact, Not The Bee is a direct reaction against the holier-than-thou institutional media and its elitist gatekeepers – a gaggle that has, for decades, had its head in the clouds and <i>demands </i>respect because sometime back in 1920, there was an editor somewhere who actually cared about objectivity and journalistic integrity.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div', 'class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"block sm:hidden\" id=\"Notthebee_Player_Mobile\"></div>\n<p>Likewise, our big bro The Babylon Bee is a reaction against the sacred cows of those in power, poking fun at their smugness and solemnity and traditions like Elijah mocked the prophets of Baal.</p>\n<p>We have never purported to be an objective outlet. </p>\n<p>We write openly with said biases, because we believe you are adults with eyes and functioning prefrontal cortexes who would like to dialogue with other adults without the Ministry of Truth telling you what to think under the guise of objectivity.</p>\n<p>This is why I found it absolutely hilarious that editors over at Wikipedia had a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Are_Babylon_Bee_and_Not_the_Bee_reliable_sources\">long discussion</a> about our reliability as outlets.</p>\n<p>Some screenshots in case this story gets traction and they take down the link:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>Yep, we\'re right in there between terrorism and beaches.</p>\n<p>I love it.</p>\n<p>Now look at the setup for the discussion:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>If you\'re wondering what \"harmful\" article example they linked to, it was this:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"text-left\"></div></div></div>\n<p>Yep, we called out groomers and abusive parents who have caused immense harm to their daughter by telling her she\'s a boy.</p>\n<p>But we are the harmful ones for thinking that this is a bad thing!</p>\n<p>We also don\'t separate opinion from factual reporting, which is <i>totally</i> what the mainstream media does with 24/7 feeds on Orange Man Bad, how Mother Earth is burning, why Joe Biden\'s latest ice cream flavor proves he\'s the Messiah, and those \"pouncing\" Republicans.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>You want to know why some of our authors are anonymous? Because they would be utterly destroyed by people like Taylor Lorenz at WaPo, who regularly dox ordinary citizens who threaten the regime instead of making sure democracy doesn\'t die in darkness.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"text-left\"></div></div></div>\n<p>Our motto is \"What A Time To Be Alive,\" because we report on news that should be fringe satire but instead is real life. If we reported it all with a straight face, you honestly wouldn\'t believe it was real!</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>These guys are gonna make Harambe cry!</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>Oh, I can assure you that we in no way consider ourselves \"legit.\"</p>\n<p>See, legitimacy as they mean it is defined by support from ruling institutions. Our credibility is based one whether the right people give us the right honors, degrees, and awards.</p>\n<p>Simply put, we don\'t want any of that. We aren\'t the English nobility looking down our noses at you little people and hiding behind fancy titles and accolades. </p>\n<p>Our reliability is proven in the trenches next to you all, by the weight of our words alone.</p>\n<p>You might think we\'re the crazy Irishman, or you might think we\'re William Wallace himself, but either way, we\'re all shaking our derrières at the elites as we prepare for battle.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62fa8f4d570f8.gif\"></div></div>\n<p>Do our staff members have formal training and degrees in journalism? Yes. Does that matter to us? Very little. </p>\n<p>What\'s more important is that we\'re average husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters, who see the need for laughing at the impending train wreck facing our nation and civilization in the hopes that someone will see through the media\'s Wizard-of-Oz charade that\'s dominated American life for decades.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>There ya go!</p>\n<p>Lest you think these editors – the purported Gatekeepers of Reliability for all the Kingdom of Wiki – have the capability to objectively note that we are certainly a humorous news outlet with an open bias but that this doesn\'t mean we are unreliable, hold up:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>Amazing.</p>\n<p>Again, these people think they are the Last Bastion of Truth for the internet, and that their word will carry forward through time to inform all the peoples of the world of what is right. And in that noble quest, they believe themselves to be the only objective thinkers in all said world, rightly able to stay unbiased while wisely sifting through the facts.</p>\n<p>These stalwart editors then throw out conservative \"talking points,\" Tucker Carlsen [sic],\" and \"wack\" in the same statement.</p>\n<p>Yep. Totally objective.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>Reminds me of the atheists who used to run around my high school looking down on anyone who believed in God. So smart! So enlightened! So unbiased!</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>See how enlightened this editor is? He or she consumes media from both sides of the spectrum and is above us all.</p>\n<p>I want to focus in on the use of one word though:</p>\n<h4>\"Supposedly\" </h4>\n<p>Oh, the absurdity of the Left is merely alleged or supposed??</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"text-left\"></div></div></div>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"text-left\"></div></div></div>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div class=\"text-left\"></div></div></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, that was like the first three articles I came across in a 3-second search. We have <i>thousands</i> of articles like that.</p>\n<p>In the end, the discussion was closed, since the moderators didn\'t think us worthy of their time. </p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"></div></div>\n<p>As an outlet, do we get things wrong? Yep. Information travels fast. There are definitely times we report on things – like the \"Ghost of Kyiv\" – that other outlets are reporting but that turn out to be fake.</p>\n<p>We also have 1/1,000th of the staff of a typical media outlet, and even less of a budget.</p>\n<p>And yet we, some random men and women writing from our living rooms while our kids run around screaming and our dogs are barking at the mailman, are taking on the woke establishment with its billions of dollars and decades of momentum.</p>\n<p>In case you\'re wondering, here are a few outlets that Wikipedia <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Perennial_sources#Sources\">considers</a> \"reliable.\"</p>\n\nBuzzfeed News\nCNN\nLos Angeles Times\nMSNBC\nThe Nation\nNPR\nThe New York Times\nPlayboy\nPolitifact\nVogue\n\n<p>Holy moly am I glad we are not on that list!

Finally, we will look at <strong>the formation of whiteness today as a site of privilege, aggrieved entitlement, and violence</strong>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Essig is white herself, and I always wonder what demons these people are trying to expel to engage in such self-hatred.</p>\n<p>How about a course on \"Decolonizing Porn,\" asked no one ever?</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this course we will use feminist, queer, critical race, and decolonial theories to analyze porn in Europe and the Americas. <strong>The goal is to give students the analytic tools they need to think deeply about the centrality of porn to our lives</strong> and to global capitalism</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ummm… you know, maybe some of this stuff is best left between you and your therapist. Really, you don\'t have to turn your every errant neurosis into a course.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62f927e197527.gif\"></div></div>\n<p>And then there\'s, \"Sociology of Heterosexuality.\"</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Most people believe that heterosexuality is natural or rooted in biology</strong>…</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, yes they do.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62f9286927f26.gif\"></div></div>\n<p>If only there were some explanation for why that would be. Well, other than it is the foundational principle upon which rests our entire species.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62f928c6cde38.gif\"></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>…<strong>and so never look very closely at it as a product of culture</strong>. In this course we will examine the artifacts, institutions, rituals, and ideologies <strong>that construct heterosexuality</strong> and the heterosexual person in American culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is no \"heterosexual person\" in American culture that needs constructing. It\'s the biological norm. It\'s why we\'re here. We don\'t need to treat homosexuals like infants by suggesting heterosexuality is merely a social construct and to do so is demeaning and condescending.</p>\n<p>In case you need more proof that Essig is a deeply unhappy and perpetually aggrieved woman, she wrote a book, \"<i>Love, Inc.: Dating Apps, the Big White Wedding, and Chasing the Happily Neverafter</i>.\"</p>\n<p>Here is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Inc-Wedding-Chasing-Neverafter/dp/0520300491\">Amazon description</a>.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, this is intended to get you to purchase this book.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The notion of \"happily ever after\" has been ingrained in many of us since childhood — meet someone, date, <strong>have the big white wedding</strong>…</p></blockquote>\n<p>She really needs to talk to someone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…and enjoy your well-deserved future. But why do we buy into this idea? Is love really all we need?</p>\n<p>Author Laurie <strong>Essig invites us to flip this concept of romance on its head and see it for what it really is — an ideology that we desperately cling to as a way to cope with the fact that we believe we cannot control or affect the societal, economic, and political structures around us.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imagine for a moment, getting stuck sitting next to Essig on a cross-country flight.</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62f929b3ca4f4.gif\"></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>From <strong>climate change to nuclear war, white nationalism</strong> to the worship of wealth and conspicuous consumption — <strong>as the future becomes seemingly less secure</strong>,…</p></blockquote>\n<p>This, from a college professor living during an age of unprecedented abundance and freedom.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…Americans turn away from the public sphere and find shelter in the private. Essig argues that <strong>when we do this, we allow romance to blind us to the real work that needs to be done</strong> — building global movements that inspire a <strong>change in government policies to address economic and social inequality.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Therapy. So. Much. Therapy.</p>\n<p>What of her co-researcher, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.york.cuny.edu/portal_college/vjones1\">Vincent Jones II</a>, a professor of community health at York College in New York?</p>\n<p>Jones is a graduate of Middlebury, likely where he met Essig, maybe even took her course on \"Men and Masculinities\" where she explains that</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"...we will then trace these late 19th century men and masculinities into <strong>our current moment of political machismo, trolling misogyny</strong>,…\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>No wonder why he wanted to team up with her! She\'s probably a laugh riot during coffee breaks!</p>\n<p>In any case, there is not much on Vincent. He does have a series of education degrees and a focus on health education.</p>\n<p>His published articles include \"A content analysis of TikTok videos focused on racial discrimination against Asians…\" and his areas of expertise include \"Health on mobile dating apps\" which makes me think he spends more time on his iPhone than my 12-year-old.</p>\n<p>In any case, these are the people who have been imbued by the media as embodying Science itself, so let\'s turn back to that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many gay bars popped up after the white gentrification of Black and Latinx neighborhoods, they wrote, but hetrification is different because it\'s \"an appropriation not just of space, but of culture.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>I see, gay bars popping up in white neighborhoods after the black and Latinos had been kicked out is not an appropriation of culture but bachelorette parties in those very same bars is because… just because.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many of female bachelorette party attendees see themselves as allies of the LGBTQ community because they are welcome in queer spaces and familiar with queer pop culture, like yelling \"Yass queen!\" and singing along to Cher.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love the casual stereotyping that the Left seems so comfortable with.</p>\n<p>Singing along with Cher? I\'ve sang along with Cher. I had no idea I was appropriating anything other than a sense of good taste.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But, \"just after several drinks, <strong>many may grab the butt of a cute gay man or take selfies in front of the leather daddies as if they were exhibits in some queer zoo,\" the researchers wrote.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>No, they\'re drunk. They\'re doing what drunk people do, which are drunk things.</p>\n<p>Only someone with WAY too many degrees would think anything else.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Worse than their post-homophobic homophobia,…</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"Post-homophobic homophobia\" is another way of saying that no matter what you do, what you think and what you say, you will always be a homophobe so shut up.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…when we asked the bridal parties if anyone in their group was lesbian, bisexual, or trans, <strong>they answered with a rather stunned ‘I have no idea\' as if women\'s queerness was a topic best not broached</strong>,\" the professors wrote. \"</p></blockquote>\n<h4>\"As if\"?!</h4>\n<p>Why use data and dispassionate observations when you can use your own biases and prejudices instead!</p>\n<p>The women were not stunned by the question because the topic is \"best not broached,\" they were stunned because like normally well-adjusted human beings, they don\'t make sexual orientation the center of their existence.</p>\n<p>Some more Science coming at ya!</p>\n<blockquote><p>One bisexual woman in Provincetown…</p></blockquote>\n<p>One.</p>\n<p>Do you really need more than one data point to draw broad conclusions regarding the behavior of an entire demographic?</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62f92b7282357.gif\"></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>…said that <strong>she was often treated with revulsion by these women</strong>, taking her back to her high school days. ‘<strong>These were the same people who would have bullied me in high school</strong>. Now they want to come to our party?\'\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>This one women they interviewed clearly has unresolved issues because none of these clueless drunk bachelorettes have any idea what she\'s talking about.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…The women the researchers interviewed<strong> never discussed transphobia</strong>...</p></blockquote>\n<p>Because why would they? They\'re not transphobes. They wouldn\'t go to an LGBTQ bar if they were. They might have been snotty, that would be unsurprising, but there\'s a reason research has to be carefully designed so as to eliminate all this extraneous confounding baggage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In short, <strong>the women had an offensively superficial understanding </strong>of the challenges still facing queer people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Say the people who assert that singing along with Cher is a sign of queer culture.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To come into queer spaces and actually believe that we live in a post-homophobic world is a kind of hostile occupation.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"Hostile occupation,\" in which you pay to be there.</p>\n<p>Sounds more like a rental to me.</p>\n<p>And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2022/08/08/researchers-warn-bachelorette-parties-in-provincetown-are-destroying-lgbtq-safe-spaces/\">a lucrative one</a> at that.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Drag queens told the researchers <strong>that bachelorette parties are their main source of income</strong>, with fewer members of the LGBTQ+ community attending the shows.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, let\'s destroy drag queen\'s main source of income in the name of equity.</p>\n<p>That will show those affluent white women!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hetrification weaponizes heteronormativity and breaks down queer spaces,\" they added. \"The incessant visitation of heteronormative misconduct slowly diminishes the integrity of the space … [leaving venues] at risk of being disabled as safe havens for the LGBTQ+ community.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>But also profitable, in fact, there very well might be fewer spaces if the bachelorette income were to dry up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The issue Essig and Jones describe isn\'t merely academic navel-gazing. <strong>The number of gay bars in the U.S. declined by 37 percent between 2007 and 2019</strong>, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/12/10/lesbia-gay-queer-bars-return/\">a study cited in <i>The Washington Post</i></a>. <strong>The number of lesbian bars declined by 52 percent</strong> during the<strong> </strong>same period. The COVID pandemic has caused many more to shut down too.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The researchers treat this as an unsolved mystery of sorts.</p>\n<p>It\'s real simple:</p>\n<p>Gays are largely welcome in general in most public spaces these days.</p>\n<p>Glad I could clear up that conundrum for them.</p>\n<p>To return to the headline for a moment, this is the \"science\" we are supposed to rely on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In their op-ed, <strong>Essig and Jones didn\'t share details about their research methodology</strong>, like how many queer spaces they observed or the data they used to reach their conclusions. <strong>As such, it\'s unclear whether what they observed in Provincetown represents a national or worldwide trend.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>This was an op-ed. This wasn\'t even a research paper never mind a peer-reviewed one as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>And it looked only at Provincetown.</p>\n<p>I\'ve been to Provincetown. There was an old joke that half the residents were Portuguese fishermen, and the other half were gay, and all the Portuguese fishermen were out to sea.</p>\n<p>That\'s Provincetown, the place where my wife and I were called \"breeders.\"</p>\n<p><i>That\'s </i>the place that\'s threatened by drunk white chicks?</p>\n<p>This is science the way Taco Bell is a Mexican restaurant.</p>\n<p>And I\'m being unkind to Taco Bell.</p>\n<p>This was a hateful unhappy women dragging along this poor man unfortunate enough to have attended her classes so they could hang around gay bars for a weekend, talk to a handful of people, and then write an Op-Ed, the conclusion of which was prepared well ahead of time.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>Science, real science that is, says....</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><img class=\"mx-auto\" src=\"https://media.notthebee.com/articles/article-62f933ebad550.gif\"></div></div>\n<hr class=\"w-32 my-8 border-gray-400\">\n<p>\nP.S.

href=\"https://alphanews.org/minneapolis-teachers-union-contract-calls-for-layoffs-of-white-teachers-first/\">Alpha News</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Minneapolis teachers union contract stipulates that white teachers will be laid off or reassigned before \"educators of color\" in the event Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) needs to reduce staff.</p>\n<p>After the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers (MFT) and MPS <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://alphanews.org/minneapolis-schools-union-meet-tentative-deal-to-end-strike/\">struck a deal</a> on March 25 to end a 14-day teacher strike, the two sides drew up and ratified', 'a new collective bargaining agreement complete with various proposals.</p>\n<p>One of the proposals dealt with \"educators of color protections.\" The agreement states that if a non-white teacher is subject to excess, MPS must excess a white teacher with the \"next least\" seniority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Minneapolis, you can\'t fire a black teacher unless you fire a white teacher first.</p>\n<p>This is, of course, racist and probably illegal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Starting with the Spring 2023 Budget Tie-Out Cycle, if excessing a teacher who is a member of a population underrepresented among licensed teachers in the site, the District shall excess the next least senior teacher, who is not a member of an underrepresented population,\" the agreement reads.</p>\n<p>According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.uft.org/faqs/what-excessing-what-difference-between-excessing-and-layoffs\">United Federation of Teachers</a>, \"excessing\" means \"reducing staff in a particular school when there is a reduction in the number of available positions in a title or license area in that school.\"</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5

working in various programs, \"may be exempted from district-wide layoff[s] outside seniority order.\" The agreement also prioritizes the reinstatement of teachers from \"underrepresented populations\" over white teachers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, instead of making downsizing decisions based on seniority or merit, Minneapolis has agreed to make those decisions based completely on race.</p>\n<p>You know, because they aNtI-rAcIsT.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The stated justification for these measures is \"to remedy the continuing effects of past discrimination by the District.\"</p>\n<p>\"Past discrimination by the District disproportionately impacted the hiring of underrepresented teachers in the District, as compared to the relevant labor market and the community, and resulted in a lack of diversity of teachers,\" the agreement adds.</p>\n<p>The Star Tribune <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.startribune.com/new-minneapolis-teacher-contract-language-disrupts-seniority-to-protect-educators-of-color/600179265/\">reports</a> that the \"seniority-disrupting language\" of the agreement is one of the first of its kind in the entire United States.

With both positions claiming to be biblically based, it is crucially important to fully examine what exactly the Bible does say on the issue of complementarianism vs. egalitarianism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Generally, conservatives side with a complementarian model, which denies women can be pastors or serve in positions over men (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Tim%202.11%E2%80%9314\">1 Timothy 2:11 – 14)</a>, and liberals tend towards egalitarianism or the \"equality of the sexes\" approach.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/smashbaals/status/1558993579657265152\">Smash Idols</a> has a different perspective, throwing out this binary completely.</p>\n<p>Here are his thoughts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God created men and women equally as both were created in the image of God. (Gen 1:27) However, God created men to be the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the Church. (Eph 5:23) This is not a difference in value but of authority.</p>\n<p>Husbands are commanded to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. In 1 Peter 3:17 we are told women are the weaker vessel. This is the same way that fine china is weaker than a regular dinner plate. They are to be handled carefully because they have been made more delicately.</p>\n<p>Women are told in Eph 5:22 to submit to their husband. This hierarchy of authority existed before the fall and the curse of the fall for women was that their desire would be to rule over their husbands. (Gen 3:16) This is Biblical Patriarchy which means father rule.</p>\n<p>While we are thankful to our complementairian brothers and sisters who stand firm that the office of pastor is explicitly for men it falls short of a consistent Biblical ordering of society.</p>\n<p>In Isaiah 3 God tells Israel He is going to judge them. The Lord said He will remove the mighty man, warrior, judge, prophet, diviner, and elder. In their stead God says, \"their oppressors are children and women rule over them.\"</p>\n<p>Jeremiah 51:30 describes the mighty warriors of Babylon as becoming like women. How much worse is it that we send our mothers, wives, and daughters to defend us?</p>\n<p>In a rightly ordered Biblical society men would rule well. However, men often fail and God\'s curse of removing these male leaders can be seen in examples like with Deborah.</p>\n<p>With no man to be judge, Deborah was judging Israel which was itself a judgment. When Barak refused to go into battle without Deborah by his side it was proclaimed that a woman would get the glory for defeating the Canaanites.</p>\n<p>This isn\'t a girl boss moment but another judgment of the cowardice of the Israelite men.</p>\n<p>A Biblically patriarchal society will have men ruling well who provide and protect their wives so they can relax into their femininity to love their husband and their children.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, God created man and women equally in value. However, he created man to be the head of his wife as Christ is head of the church. Women are to submit to their husbands as unto the Lord and an excellent wife is the crown of her husband.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I may not be ready to abandon the complementarian movement, these are definitely compelling arguments to consider.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>What do you ladies and gentlemen (and I do mean ladies and gentlemen) think?
