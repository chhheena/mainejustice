Here is a review of some bipartisan misconduct and illegal behavior.</p>\n<div id=\"ld-8276-1099\"></div>\n<p><strong>Michigan: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nDemocrat Kwame Kilpatrick, known as the “hip-hop” mayor was the youngest person ever elected to this office in the 2001 mayoral election in Detroit, at the age of 31. He ran for re-election in 2005 against Democrat Freeman Hendrix who was endorsed by the major news organizations in Detroit. Kilpatrick had been embroiled in various scandals including raiding the city coffers. Hendrix was the favorite to win until “surprise” results late on election', 'night supposedly turned the election to Kilpatrick. (Does late night absentee ballot dumps sound familiar?) In fact, Hendrix beat Kilpatrick in the primary election by a comfortable margin- however, he lost in the general election.<br>\nDetroit was not well served with Kilpatrick as its mayor thereafter with more corruption such as racketeering, mail fraud and bribery- 24 felonies in total! He was sentenced to 28 yrs. in prison, but his sentence was commuted by President Trump (on Trump’s final night in the White House), after he served for only 7 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Michigan: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Republican</span></strong><br>\nPaul Manni, a Sterling Heights, Michigan Republican candidate for City Council was recently <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/08/09/former-sterling-heights-candidate-charged-forging-absentee-app-signatures/10276697002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">charged with forging signatures</a> on multiple absentee ballot applications in the Nov 2021 election.</p>\n<p><strong>Michigan: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nSouthfield Clerk, Democrat Sherikia Hawkins, faces six <a href=\"https://www.audacy.com/wwjnewsradio/articles/news/southfield-clerk-faces-felony-charges-election-fraud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">felony charges</a> related to forging or falsifying election records in the Nov 2018 election. Specifically, she was charged with tossing out absentee ballots after they had arrived at the clerk’s office and were logged into the computer system. She justified this by claiming the ballot envelopes were not properly signed by voters when the real purpose was to hide discrepancies in the number of absentee ballots cast compared to the number counted.</p>\n<span class=\"z-trending-headline\">\n<p style=\"background:#fff\">\n<strong>Trending: </strong><a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/while-fact-checkers-play-defense-for-obama-heres-the-truth-about-30-million-pages-of-his-regimes-records-that-were-trucked-to-chicago/\" class=\"mostpopular-157017\"><span class=\"mostpopular-title\">While “Fact-checkers” Play Defense For Obama… Here’s The Truth About 30 Million Pages of His Regime’s Records that Were “Trucked to Chicago”</span></a>\n</p>\n</span><p><strong>Michigan: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nKathy Funk ran as a Democrat for township clerk in Flint, Michigan in the election of 2020. She was accused of purposely breaking a seal on a container for ballots so that the votes could not be totaled during an anticipated recount. She won re-election with a slim margin in the unofficial count. She was charged with <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/michigan-election-official-charged-with-ballot-tampering-misconduct_4334551.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ballot tampering and misconduct</a> in office.</p>\n<p><strong>Pennsylvania: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nIn 2021, Democrat Marie Beren, a top election official in Philadelphia, was charged with multiple counts of <a href=\"https://neonnettle.com/news/17023-democrat-judge-of-elections-charged-in-massive-voter-fraud-scheme-in-philadelphia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voter fraud and conspiracy</a>. Beren served as a “judge of elections” which essentially is the head of a polling place. She engaged in multiple illegal activities such as casting votes herself in other people’s names, advising in-person voters to support a certain candidate and encouraging voters to cast additional votes from family members who were not present. She and other workers would also add names to the poll books of people who never even came into the polling place in order to falsely match the number of fake votes cast. She and other workers engaged in this activity from 2015-2019. Prosecutors noted that fraud occurred “at every level of government, from municipal to state to federal.”</p>\n<div class=\"z-ad-mypillow-inline mypillow-sidebar\">\n<div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-single a-15\">\n<p>Use promo code <a href=\"https://mystore.com/mycoffee/\" target=\"_blank\">FedUp</a> at checkout and save big on MyCoffee.</p>\n<a href=\"https://mystore.com/mycoffee/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/mycoffee-01-fedup.jpg\"></a>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>North Carolina: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Republican</span></strong><br>\nNorth Carolina was no stranger to election tampering. L.McCrae Dowless Jr. was convicted of <a href=\"https://www.honestelections.org/a-congressional-race-was-thrown-out-because-of-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">voter fraud</a> in 2016 and 2018, sentenced to prison and fined. In the 2018 primary election, he and his political operatives collected ballots from voters which were kept at his home. They would fill in votes on parts or all of some ballots to favor certain Republican candidates, specifically Republican Mark Harris who was running for North Carolina’s 9th congressional district. They also forged some witness signatures following Dowless’s directions to utilize steps to avoid detection. This included controlling the color of the pens used for the witness signatures, signing a different person’s name as a witness to avoid having the same person as witness to too many ballots and making sure to deliver no more than nine ballots in each visit to the post office. They also made sure they used post offices near where the voters lived. Mark Harris won the initial election but when this ballot fraud was uncovered a new election was called. Harris did not run again. He was not charged with election fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>Virginia: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nIn Virginia, Fairfax County Democrat <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-county-is-violating-election-law-amid-governor-race-lawsuit-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">election officials</a> issued ballots for voters who failed to comply with the state’s legal requirement that they include the final four digits of their Social Security numbers on their applications for a mail-in or absentee ballot. This was a clear <a href=\"https://thefdrlst.wpengine.com/2021/10/25/how-virginia-democrats-are-working-to-make-elections-sloppy-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">violation of election law</a>. The state court refused to proscribe the Fairfax County officials, with the conclusion that the nonprofit Virginia Institute for Public Policy lacked “standing”, or the right to sue, over the violation. Glenn Youngkin, Republican, won the governor’s race in 2021, and so this issue may seem moot. But it shouldn’t be. Illegalities should be exposed and called out regardless of if the ensuing consequences are small or large.</p>\n<p><strong>New Jersey: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nIn 2020, four Democrats were <a href=\"https://neonnettle.com/news/11804-trump-proved-right-democrats-charged-with-mail-in-voter-fraud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">charged and arrested</a> for a mail-in ballot election fraud scheme in New Jersey. Two of them were Paterson City Council members. Charges included unauthorized possession of ballots, tampering with and falsifying public records, as well as false registrations.</p>\n<p><strong>Florida: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Republican</span></strong><br>\nIn <a href=\"https://dccc.org/florida-republicans-continue-to-lead-on-election-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Florida</a>, Republican canvassers changed the party registration of more than 100 voters without their consent in 2021. These were voters from low-income housing projects throughout Miami.</p>\n<div class=\"tpd-box-ad-d z-ad-adsense-inline-2 z-ad-revcontent-inline-2\">\n\n\n</div>\n<p><strong>Connecticut: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nIn 2017, <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/voter-fraud-alleged-ct-democratic-official-charged/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael DeFilippo</a>, a Democrat and landlord, stole voter registrations and absentee ballots from college students in his building and forged their signatures in order to vote for himself for a city council seat. He was indicted for election fraud and faces up to 85 years in prison.</p>\n<p><strong>Maryland: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Republican</span></strong><br>\nIn Maryland, in 2011, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/ex-ehrlich-campaign-manager-schurick-convicted-in-robocall-case/2011/12/06/gIQA6rNsaO_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paul Schurick</a>, was the campaign manager for the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Robert L. Ehrlich, who ultimately lost in the general election. But Schurick was convicted of authorizing robocalls<br>\non Election Day that used false information to discourage 112,000 registered Democrats in largely black Baltimore and in Prince George County from voting in 2010.</p>\n<p><strong>Missouri: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Democrat</span></strong><br>\nIn 2016, Penny Hubbard ran as a Democrat in a <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/9029\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">primary race</a> in Missouri’s 78th House District. She won by only 90 votes. This was contested by Bruce Franks Jr, her opponent. Upon investigation, it was found that Hubbard won due to a lopsided absentee vote count which heavily favored her. A judge ruled that enough illegitimate absentee votes had been cast to affect the outcome. A new election was held, and Franks easily beat Hubbard by a margin of 1,500 votes.</p>\n<p>In his book, “Dirty Little Secrets”, political analyst Larry Sabato noted that Republican election fraud is less common than Democrat fraud. The reason? Republican voters tend to be middle class and not easily induced to commit fraud while “the pool of people who appear to be available and more vulnerable to an invitation to participate in vote fraud tend to lean Democratic.” In addition, Paul Herrison, director of the Center for American Politics at the University of Maryland, stated that “most incidents of wide-scale voter fraud reportedly occur in inner cities, which are largely populated by minority groups.”</p>\n<p>Election experts, Hans von Spakovsky and John Fund in their book, “Who’s Counting?” stated that “Democrats are far more skilled at encouraging poor people- who need money- to participate in vote-buying schemes. “I had no choice. I was hungry that day,” Thomas Felder told the Miami Herald, in explaining why he illegally voted in a mayoral election. “You wanted the money; you were told who to vote for.” And sometimes, it’s not just food that vote stealers are hungry for.</p>\n<p>A former Democratic congressman told one of these authors, “When many Republicans lose an election, they go back into what they call the private sector. When many Democrats lose an election, they lose power and money. They need to eat, and people will do an awful lot in order to eat.”</p>\n<p>Abraham Lincoln once wisely said: “Elections belong to the people. It’s their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blisters.”</p>\n<div class=\"tpd-box-ad-d z-ad-adsense-inline-1 z-ad-revcontent-inline-1\">\n\n\n</div>\n<p>It’s time to call a halt to election fraud regardless of who does it or where it occurs. But make no mistake about.

Just that simple.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bill will head to President Joe Biden, who currently in vacationing in South Carolina, for his signature next week.</p>\n<div class=\"z-contextual-ad-a z-ad-lockerdome-below\">\n<div id=\"ld-1134-7836\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"z-contextual-ad-a z-ad-lockerdome-below z-ad-publir-donate\">\n<div class=\"publir_ad6eea789a6760185563857e8db32d43\">\n<div class=\"donate publir-donate-wvo\" id=\"publirDonate_ad6eea789a6760185563857e8db32d43\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpdev-share-btns wpdev-share-btns-bottom\">\n<div class=\"essb_links essb_counters essb_displayed_shortcode essb_share essb_template_metro-retina essb_1223154215 essb_width_flex essb_size_m essb_width_flex essb_network_align_center essb_responsive_adaptive print-no\" id=\"essb_displayed_shortcode_1223154215\" data-essb-postid=\"156952\" data-essb-position=\"shortcode\" data-essb-button-style=\"button\" data-essb-template=\"metro-retina\" data-essb-counter-pos=\"hidden\" data-essb-url=\"https://100percentfedup.com/dem-rep-clyburn-is-worried-740-billion-sham-bill-wont-passheres-why/\" data-essb-fullurl=\"https://100percentfedup.com/dem-rep-clyburn-is-worried-740-billion-sham-bill-wont-passheres-why/\" data-essb-instance=\"1223154215\">\n<span class=\"essb_totalcount essb_t_l_big\" title=\"\" data-shares-text=\"shares\"><span class=\"essb_t_nb\">359<span class=\"essb_t_nb_after\">shares</span></span></span>\n <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=991115344336163&amp;display=popup&amp;name=Dem+Rep+Clyburn+Is+Worried+%24740+Billion+Sham+Bill+Won%E2%80%99t+Pass%E2%80%A6Here%E2%80%99s+Why&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2F100percentfedup.com%2Fdem-rep-clyburn-is-worried-740-billion-sham-bill-wont-passheres-why%2F&picture=https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jim-Clyburn.jpg&description=Democrats+have+decided+to+gamble+the+2022+midterms+on+the+Inflation+Reduction+Act.+The+bill+will+introduce+caps+on+some\" title=\"Share on Share\" onclick=\"essb.window(&#39;https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=991115344336163&amp;display=popup&amp;name=Dem+Rep+Clyburn+Is+Worried+%24740+Billion+Sham+Bill+Won%E2%80%99t+Pass%E2%80%A6Here%E2%80%99s+Why&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2F100percentfedup.com%2Fdem-rep-clyburn-is-worried-740-billion-sham-bill-wont-passheres-why%2F&picture=https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jim-Clyburn.jpg&description=Democrats+have+decided+to+gamble+the+2022+midterms+on+the+Inflation+Reduction+Act.+The+bill+will+introduce+caps+on+some&#39;,&#39;facebook_advanced&#39;,&#39;1223154215&#39;);

In this piece, she specifically mentioned me (Becky Behrends) as belonging to the <a href=\"https://mc4ei.com\">Michigan Citizens for Election Integrity</a> or <a href=\"https://mc4ei.com\">MC4EI</a> group, which has “spread misinformation', 'about the 2020 election.”</p>\n<div id=\"ld-8276-1099\"></div>\n<p>Let’s address the misinformation that Hendrickson and the Detroit Free Press are spreading.</p>\n<p>As Paul Harvey used to say: “Here’s the rest of the story.”</p>\n<p>She related the story of Edith Lee-Payne, an election worker in the 2020 election, who claimed she had to grab a letter opener when a Republican observer demanded that she stop the count. She claimed the observer was “just belligerent,” and she was unsure if he was armed. She was thankful that she didn’t need to use the letter opener.</p>\n<span class=\"z-trending-headline\">\n<p style=\"background:#fff\">\n<strong>Trending: </strong><a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/while-fact-checkers-play-defense-for-obama-heres-the-truth-about-30-million-pages-of-his-regimes-records-that-were-trucked-to-chicago/\" class=\"mostpopular-157017\"><span class=\"mostpopular-title\">While “Fact-checkers” Play Defense For Obama… Here’s The Truth About 30 Million Pages of His Regime’s Records that Were “Trucked to Chicago”</span></a>\n</p>\n</span><p>A GOP affiant, Janice Hermann, disagrees with this interpretation. She <a href=\"https://mc4ei.com/the-tcf-timeline-the-2020-general-election-in-detroit/\">stated</a> (p. 47) in an affidavit: “I saw a woman wield a letter opener as a weapon to make sure an observer was not close enough to see what she was doing as she duplicated ballots. Herman claims she has several other witnesses who observed this.</p>\n<p>”When the GOP challengers were being ignored in their challenges to illegal and fraudulent election inspector behavior and the refusal of election supervisors to record their challenges in log books, what were they supposed to do? If they raised their voices to get attention (heaven forbid, such aggressiveness!), they were judged as being belligerent and a threat. Who wielded a potential weapon? Not the Republican, but the presumed Democrat election inspector worker! Let’s be clear about that!! Detroit election officials later claimed the GOP challengers were “sour grapes” after their guy Trump lost because they filed no challenges during the election! A clever bit of deception that mainstream media swallowed hook, line, and sinker.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>As Ben Franklin once said, <em>“Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools that don’t have brains enough, to be honest.”</em>\n</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"z-ad-mypillow-inline mypillow-sidebar\">\n<div class=\"g g-1\"><div class=\"g-single a-15\">\n<p>Use promo code <a href=\"https://mystore.com/mycoffee/\" target=\"_blank\">FedUp</a> at checkout and save big on MyCoffee.</p>\n<a href=\"https://mystore.com/mycoffee/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/mycoffee-01-fedup.jpg\"></a>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n<p>If Hendrickson were a legitimate investigative journalist, she would have presented both sides of the story and let the public draw their own conclusions. As Becket Adams of the National Journalism Center once said in an<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSt4uU-cP5AhXbGzQIHa2kDxc4HhAWegQIBhAB&amp;url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-07-29/la-ent-american-media-democracy&amp;usg=AOvVaw32YXA7vdtbJmmf5cmiwsaa\"> LA Times</a> article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“News journalists need to focus on providing audiences with just the facts, rather than nudging them in the direction of a preferred viewpoint. This means reporting fairly and impartially on both sides of a debate and respecting audiences enough to interpret and analyze the information for themselves. They’re not children. If newsrooms want to speak out forcefully on certain issues, they always have the opinion section.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hendrickson claimed that a flood of challengers descended on the counting room in 2020 in Detroit who “mistook standard processes for fraud while others outside the room banged on the windows.” This is truly laughable if it wasn’t such a serious matter that the press can be so biased and dangerous in the misleading information they peddle out to the public as “facts.”</p>\n<h2>There was nothing “standard” about such practices as:</h2>\n<ol>\n\n<ol>\nAdjudicating ballots rejected by the tabulators without a Republican present using inflated numbers to exclude credentialed Republican challengers\nRefusing re-entry to GOP challengers trying to return from lunch breaks while allowing Democrats to have lunch and meetings inside or adjoining the counting board room.\nAccepting ballots by the thousands that did not appear in the electronic poll books or supplemental lists\nAllowing a late-night ballot drop many hours after the close of polls (Oakland County, the second largest in Michigan, finished at their counting boards around 9 pm. What is the excuse for Wayne County?)\nFailing to prevent tabulator operators from re-running ballot batches without zeroing out the count, failing to provide challengers with meaningful access to view the computer screens of the election inspectors, thus refusing to comply with a court ruling that stipulated this.\nFailing to provide challengers with meaningful access to view the computer screens of the election inspectors, thus refusing to comply with a court ruling that stipulated this.\nUsing inflated numbers to exclude credentialed Republican challengers.\n</ol>\n\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>These are just a few of the non-standard, fraudulent, illegal, and illegitimate behaviors that occurred at the TCF center in the Detroit 2020 General Election. Many <a href=\"https://mc4ei.com/decisions-decisions/\">more examples</a> could be given.</strong></h2>\n<p>And banging on the windows? As GOP challengers were worn down by attrition, thrown out and dismissed, and pizza boxes taped up on windows, common sense would tell you this was no way to inspire the confidence or trust of the Republicans, let alone the public. Their indignation and anger was totally justified.</p>\n<div class=\"tpd-box-ad-d z-ad-adsense-inline-2 z-ad-revcontent-inline-2\">\n\n\n</div>\n<p>Hendrickson presented just one side of the events at the TCF center in her portrayal of the hard-working election inspectors having been so abused, threatened, and intimidated by the GOP challengers when in fact, it was the GOP poll challengers who were being intimidated and threatened. These challengers filed over 200 affidavits attesting that the abuse came from the Democrats and was so blatant as to be unbelievable to many Republicans who had not previously been exposed to such treatment. <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201702/why-gaslighters-accuse-you-gaslighting\">Classic gaslighting manipulation</a> technique- accuse others of behaviors which they themselves are engaging in.</p>\n<p>As for the so-called “fake certificate of electors” that existed to potentially award the states&#8217; Electoral College votes to Trump, this is again another bogus Democrat talking point to go after any pro-Trump supporters. It is their way of saying, “don’t even think of trying this again, or we will go after you with our weaponized law enforcement and intelligence agencies.” Right out of a Chinese communist playbook on how to silence your opposition. Choosing an alternate slate of electors is not unknown and was never considered “fraud” in the past. Just <a href=\"http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/Articles-Main/ID/26628/1960-Hawaii-Sends-Two-Slates-to-Electoral-College\">check out what happened in Hawaii in the 1960 Nixon vs. Kennedy presidential election.</a></p>\n<p>This free press reporter also stated, &#8220;The process is prescribed and methodical. There are multiple eyes watching ballots at every step. It’s a system that both undercuts 2020 fraud claims, but also prevents any meddling officials say they&#8217;ve prepared to confront this year.” Watching ballots at every step??? Except for the Republican challengers, who were often barred from watching and observing. And except for the total lack of bipartisan involvement and a chain of custody in the transferring of ballots to the TCF center for counting. But the Democrats couldn’t be bothered with these “minor details.”</p>\n<p>As for the lawsuits claiming a stolen election that “failed in court,” this is an attempt to convince the public that the Trump position must, therefore, be bogus and totally without merit. Not surprising that these lawsuits didn’t get their day in court. In fact, most of them never received an <a href=\"https://centerforsecuritypolicy.org/dr-david-clements-not-a-single-electoral-fraud-case-was-given-an-evidentiary-hearing/\">“evidentiary hearing</a>.” What else would we expect when liberal judges dominate the judiciary at all levels? For example, if one looks at the <a href=\"https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2017/12/how_liberal_is_your_federal_circuit_court.html\">federal circuit court system</a>, one concludes that Democrat judges function as reliable liberals, but Republican judges do not always equal reliable conservatives. Over time, a certain percentage of these Republican judges drift to the left. So, grass root conservatives cannot depend on a judge having an R next to his name as one who will uphold the rule of law instead of their own ideological bent.</p>\n<p>And so it goes. Ms. Hendrickson is the town crier merely parroting the term “election denier” to those who question the 2020 election.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-156930 aligncenter\" src=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clara-hendrickson-politifact--740x357.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clara-hendrickson-politifact--740x357.jpg 740w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clara-hendrickson-politifact--1034x499.jpg 1034w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clara-hendrickson-politifact--1536x741.jpg 1536w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clara-hendrickson-politifact--scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\"></p>\n<p>George Orwell had it right when he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><em>“(True) Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.” </em></h2>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"tpd-box-ad-d z-ad-adsense-inline-1 z-ad-revcontent-inline-1\">\n\n\n</div>\n<p>It appears that parrots and lemmings are back in full force, marching to the beat of the legacy media.

and his family, including disgraced first son Hunter, are spending their summer vacation at a $20 million beachfront mansion in South Carolina, The Post has learned — and they’re not paying a dime.</p>\n<p>The president recently asked prominent Democratic donor Maria Allwin — the widow of hedge fund founder James Allwin — if he could stay at her nine-bedroom Kiawah Island estate, a source close to Allwin told The Post.</p>\n<div class=\"tpd-box-ad-d z-ad-adsense-inline-2 z-ad-revcontent-inline-2\">\n\n\n</div>\n<p>“They stayed here before and they’re not paying,” the source said. “They’ve never paid. They’re just friends.”</p>\n<p>The property features a large swimming pool on two acres and is surrounded by palm trees and other lush vegetation for privacy.</p>\n<p>The White House frustrated reporters by offering little transparency about Biden’s South Carolina trip, which is expected to last through early next week.</p>\n<p>Allwin has contributed to an array of mostly Democratic political campaigns, but her most recent donations are to Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and a PAC supporting her effort to beat back a primary challenge by Donald Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"z-contextual-ad-a z-ad-lockerdome-below\">\n<div id=\"ld-1134-7836\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"z-contextual-ad-a z-ad-lockerdome-below z-ad-publir-donate\">\n<div class=\"publir_ad6eea789a6760185563857e8db32d43\">\n<div class=\"donate publir-donate-wvo\" id=\"publirDonate_ad6eea789a6760185563857e8db32d43\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"wpdev-share-btns wpdev-share-btns-bottom\">\n<div class=\"essb_links essb_counters essb_displayed_shortcode essb_share essb_template_metro-retina essb_1469205287 essb_width_flex essb_size_m essb_width_flex essb_network_align_center essb_responsive_adaptive print-no\" id=\"essb_displayed_shortcode_1469205287\" data-essb-postid=\"156916\" data-essb-position=\"shortcode\" data-essb-button-style=\"button\" data-essb-template=\"metro-retina\" data-essb-counter-pos=\"hidden\" data-essb-url=\"https://100percentfedup.com/crooked-biden-family-vacations-in-20-million-sc-mansion-owned-by-major-liz-cheney-donor/\" data-essb-fullurl=\"https://100percentfedup.com/crooked-biden-family-vacations-in-20-million-sc-mansion-owned-by-major-liz-cheney-donor/\" data-essb-instance=\"1469205287\">\n<span class=\"essb_totalcount essb_t_l_big\" title=\"\" data-shares-text=\"shares\"><span class=\"essb_t_nb\">357<span class=\"essb_t_nb_after\">shares</span></span></span>\n <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=991115344336163&amp;display=popup&amp;name=Crooked+Biden+Family+Vacations+In+%2420+Million+SC+Mansion+Owned+By+Major+Liz+Cheney+Donor&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2F100percentfedup.com%2Fcrooked-biden-family-vacations-in-20-million-sc-mansion-owned-by-major-liz-cheney-donor%2F&picture=https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/biden-vacation.png&description=On+Monday%2C+the+FBI+raided+President+Trumps+Mar-a-Lago+estate.+The+raid+was+the+latest+attempt+to+pin+some+crime+on\" title=\"Share on Share\" onclick=\"essb.window(&#39;https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=991115344336163&amp;display=popup&amp;name=Crooked+Biden+Family+Vacations+In+%2420+Million+SC+Mansion+Owned+By+Major+Liz+Cheney+Donor&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2F100percentfedup.com%2Fcrooked-biden-family-vacations-in-20-million-sc-mansion-owned-by-major-liz-cheney-donor%2F&picture=https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/biden-vacation.png&description=On+Monday%2C+the+FBI+raided+President+Trumps+Mar-a-Lago+estate.+The+raid+was+the+latest+attempt+to+pin+some+crime+on&#39;,&#39;facebook_advanced&#39;,&#39;1469205287&#39;);

They got to be ready to kick people out and not give everyone a free cup of coffee.

Rather than alter their policies at the risk of appearing less woke, Starbucks would rather close down stores.

It appears that some of the administrators of the UFO secrets (part of a continuous investigative process of at least 75 years) are trying to reveal (but still controlling the narrative). And it seems that other factions are trying to interrupt that revelation.</p>\n<p>Some prominent credentialed people who worked or still work for the US government have stated that there really are vehicles that are not of this world and that some of the UFOs have no natural or prosaic explanation. However, in the preliminary report of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), also released to the public on June 25, 2021, it was said again “we don&#8217;t know what they are.” This shows an internal contradiction or perhaps a strategy of revealing little but &#8211; for various reasons &#8211; always keeping some of the old explanations. I don&#8217;t know if this is all coordinated or if some factions put it one way and others another but I think it is most likely that ultra-conservatives associated with aerospace corporations (the so-called &#8220;Beltway Bandits&#8221;) would be the ones that most want to control the delivery of information. And another more liberal faction wants to release information because they know that keeping the population out of this is unsustainable or they know that humanity needs to know these things to evolve and not destroy themselves.</p>\n<p>They used to deny almost everything and now they are revealing but also denying parts of what they know. But why? Fear that human society can&#8217;t handle it? Afraid of having to admit that billions have been invested in secret, that lawmakers have denied access to information, or even that there have been illegal actions against innocent civilians to maintain secrecy? Fear of losing control of an unusual technological development? It is said that the US has several objects that do not belong to the human species and that Russia and China also have something and are trying to reach the US investigation.<br>\nAs an example of someone who has stated more forcefully that the US government possesses something extraordinary is Mr. Luis Elizondo (former Director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program or “AATIP”) and there is the renowned physicist Bob Davis (who has worked on many secret projects for the Pentagon). The former basically admitted that the US government has non-human artifacts.</p>\n<p>To Fox News Channel&#8217;s question by Tucker Carlson: After talking about UFOs or UAP he asks “Do you think that based on your decade of service working in the US government has in your possession any material from one of these aircraft? Elizondo: &#8220;I, I do &#8230; yes.&#8221; Tucker Carlson: Do you think the United States government has the remains of a UFO in its possession now? Luis Elizondo: “Unfortunately Tucker, I really have to be careful because of my Confidentiality Agreement. I really have to be careful about that, but simply put, yes. &#8221;</p>\n<p>In another Fox interview with Luis Elizondo, he answered: “The United States government is in possession of exotic material. And I leave it there.&#8221; (Fox News).</p>\n<p>The Obama White House officially denied in 2011 that there is evidence of an extraterrestrial presence or recovered extraterrestrial technology. But in recent interviews (2020, 2021) he said that he could not speak much of the evidence and stated that there are indeed objects flying in the sky detected by different instruments and that we cannot explain.</p>\n<p>Those who have contributed the most with articles on these topics since December 2017 have been the New York Times. For the New York Times in April 2020: Dr. Eric Davis stated that he himself had informed the US Congress that the government of that country indeed had in its possession technology that was not of this world. According to investigative journalist Ross Coulthart this was confirmed by staff working for a congressman.</p>\n<p>But the UAPTF unclassified report again tells the general public &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what they are.&#8221; If so, and if they know what they are, at least some segments within the Pentagon have lied to the country&#8217;s Congress from him for 75 years. It is as if they just want to start gradually educating the population, scientists, politicians, etc.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, the United States Air Force and the Department of the Navy, the Department of Defense, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense Intelligence had already declared that the most shocking cases of UFOs or UAPS could not be explained by alluding to prosaic phenomena such as ice crystals, misunderstood data, bad observations, etc. In addition, Senator Mitt Romney recently said that &#8220;we know this is not American, Russian or Chinese technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But, of course, if these objects have been closely observed by several of the best pilots doing impossible maneuvers, while (also simultaneously) they were detected in 4 coordinated radars and using infrared FLIR devices, sometimes maneuvering near or on navy ships by several hours or days, sometimes hundreds of them, flying far from the ground, so how are they going to be drones!</p>\n<p>The Scientific Coalition for Ufology has analyzed certain recordings and calculated at over 600g of acceleration forces! No drone, plane, or pilot could resist that! The only thing that is resisting is the mind against the available data. It is the stubbornness of the deniers, scientists or not!</p>\n<p>In 1947, the Army-Air Corps took the remains of the object that fell in Corona New Mexico (the so-called Roswell case) to the Foreign Technology Division of the Wright Field Air Force Base (now called Wright Patterson AFB) and continued to investigate after it Project Blue Book was canceled. In fact, it is already known for sure that the UFO investigation continued secretly after Project Blue Book was canceled in 1969. It is known because of the Air Force regulation JANAP 146 and the Air Force Manual 55- eleven. This despite the USAF denying that they had an interest in UFOs after 1969.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/5fb5aeedbb9f787a7ea4920555fcd16f.jpg?resize=436%2C564&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Jcs janap146\" width=\"436\" height=\"564\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>According to serious researchers like Ross Coulthart and others, the cover-up (to develop retro engineering) was first administered by the Atomic Energy Commission (a civil agency). It was then transferred to private aerospace companies, while the Pentagon&#8217;s more secretive Unacceptable Special Access Projects would provide oversight.</p>\n<p>Placing the largest secret in the hands of civil agencies or private-civil corporations would have helped representatives of the United States government to truthfully declare that the government does not possess remnants of a non-terrestrial object. But for some reason or another, they now want people to know that UFOs are real after all. And some characters with proven credentials like Elizondo and Davis are declaring that they do have these items. And they would also have incredibly advanced technology. With isotope ratios different from those found on Earth.</p>\n<p>Along with historian Richard Dolan, I believe that Messrs. Elizondo and Davis (in addition to physicist Hal Puthoff) had access to SAP projects, some of which may have been related to the UFO issue but not to the more secretive (and probably extra-legal USAPs). they escape accountability through the formal chain of command). The latter would be related to UFO retro engineering, direct study of the extraterrestrial presence, contact by psychic means, and others.</p>\n<p>The UFOs are unlikely to have been Chinese during the multi-day encounters around the USS Princeton off the east coast of Florida in 2015, or around the USS Nimitz in 2004 as they have been detected since at least the decade of 1940 when China was a backward rural country. Rather, China recently stated in the Morning Sun newspaper that it is investigating UFOs with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>The June 2015 report was prepared in coordination with various offices by the recently formed UAP Task Force (UAPTF) or &#8220;UAP Investigation Team&#8221; in conjunction with the US Navy Intelligence Office and in conjunction with the Office of the United States. of the National Director of Intelligence (ODNI) under the supervision of the Secretary of Defense. This report determines that UFOs are real, extraordinary, and of great interest. But it also seems to say or seem to want to give the impression that serious interest in UFOs only started in 2004, which is misleading. Like the military, they were just now taking this seriously. Of course, that is not true.</p>\n<p>However, there are other contributions. However, it also says that of the 144 cases studied after selecting them since 2004 in they could not explain 143. Most were cases collected by the US Navy. In addition, the preliminary report (not classified) of only 9 pages it admits something important: a real possibly advanced technological phenomenon of unknown and worrying origin.</p>\n<p>The classified version of the report given to members of the US Congress is said to be about 72 pages long. What is most classified are the means and systems of detection and monitoring, but some congressmen (Mark Warner, etc.) have said they have seen much clearer images than what the public has been able to see since this process of confirmation of reality began. UFO in 2017 &#8230; when Elizondo, Tom DeLonge, members of To the Stars Academy came to light during a YouTube conference in October of that year and later in an article in the New York Times.</p>\n<p>At least among the prosaic possibilities offered in the report of June 25, 2021, everything is talked about but the possibility of extraterrestrial technology was not ruled out either. That detail is significant.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/e34fbe28756cd6c83a0434185d677d28.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Leaked footage of \'pyramid-shaped\' UFOs is real, Pentagon says - National | Globalnews.ca\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p><strong>Leaked footage of pyramid-shaped UAP filmed with infrared over the USS Russell. Given to filmmaker Jeremy Corbell.</strong></p>\n<p>In all this, the USAF has been almost silent but I have already declared that it is interested in the UAP (although it has been in that since when it was the Army Air Corps in the 1940s!). Interestingly, following the June 25 report, Under Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks ordered that the UFO / UAP investigation be coordinated between multiple military branches and agencies.</p>\n<p>What is already undeniable is that there is ongoing evidence of past lies and manipulation that can explain the inconsistencies between truthfully disclosing and denying/lying. For example, Secretary of the Air Force D. Quarles flatly lied when asked about UFOs.</p>\n<p>And the lies started a long time ago. For better or for worse, what they said to the public is one thing and what they did in private is another. Secret Report No. 14 (Special Report No. 14) produced in 1955 by Project Blue Book with the help of analysts from the Battelle Memorial Institute showed that the more educated and credible a person was, the higher the percentage of &#8220;unknown&#8221; sightings that did not they could be explained.<br>\nMore precisely, the true number of unexplained or unknown cases was 35% for the best quality witnesses and only 21.5% overall for all the people who reported their sightings to the Air Force. So when Project Blue Book tried for some time to say that mental imbalance was a big factor behind UFO reports, they were lying too. To maintain this fiction (aided by prejudice and social taboo) the most sensitive investigations would have been transferred to private corporations.</p>\n<p>Accredited persons who proved to have worked for the US government for intelligence such as Christopher Mellon and Luis Elizondo and Hal Puthoff and physicist Bob Davis would have had access to some of the secrets related to the UFO investigation but not the most hidden investigation within some. USAPs related to private corporations. They would know that there is more and they would act as intermediaries in favor of a more determined (albeit gradual) revelation for leaders, scientists, and the population, acting as bridges between them and the ultra-secret level of investigation that apparently borders on the illicit since (at least until recently) would not have been accountable within the formal chain of command. For example (according to verified letters between Eric Davis and Admiral Wilson &#8230; letters that were leaked after the death of astronaut Edgar Mitchell), those who operated certain USAPS under private corporate terms denied Admiral Wilson access to information during the 1990s when he was the chief intelligence officer (&#8220;J2&#8221;) for the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>The statements of denier Donald Menzel (Harvard astronomer (&#8220;all unexplained observations are made by bad observers&#8221;) and scientist Carl Sagan &#8220;reliable cases are not interesting and interesting cases are not reliable&#8221;) were also extremely false, prejudiced, lacking in scientific rigor, and foolish. But those apparently &#8220;serious&#8221; statements are made up of those who do not feel rejection against the possibility of a true non-human presence. Thus, like the fanatical believers who also exist in the world of the UFO subject, many scientists and modern people who want to consider themselves &#8220;serious&#8221; also incur irrational justifications. Without proper preparation and critical thinking, neither being &#8220;open-minded&#8221; or supposedly &#8220;objective&#8221; minded necessarily falls short of the necessary epistemological cognitive balance.</p>\n<p>But the most obvious lie made to the public was made in the 1950s by the Secretary of the Air Force D. Quarles who told the public that there were only 3% of &#8220;Unknown&#8221; cases in the Project Blue Book investigation and that all could be identified as &#8220;conventional phenomena&#8221; or as &#8220;illusions&#8221; if they had enough information. It was a total lie that he was able to make because the public did not know about Special Report 14. But thanks to physicist Stanton Friedman we now know about this previously secret report.</p>\n<p>After the US Congress received the report on June 25, it organized and requested that UFO / UAP reports be delivered every 90 days, but including cases prior to 2004. This is about to happen. I believe that the second report will be given to you on September 22, 2021. In addition, the Inspector General for the Pentagon began an investigation of how the second institution has carried out the investigations of the UFO issue. They have broad authority and are independent. This investigation could take several years. Maybe they can find out if it was illegally hiding from Congress or if there were irregularities and unexplained expenses. Everything seems to point to an attempt to regain civil and politically formal control of the most secret investigations managed by a basically independent committee of unknown persons coordinating military sectors under the legal protection of private corporations.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Mr. Elizondo brought a lawsuit against the Pentagon for having denied that he worked at the AWSAAP and as director of the AATIP investigating UFO / UAP and for having deleted all his emails. He hired the famous lawyer Daniel Sheehan who also investigated the UFO issue hired by the Congressional Investigation Office at the request of former President Jimmy Carter when he was denied detailed information on UFOs.</p>\n<p>Scientists are reacting. The formal interest of the Pentagon, the ODNI, the congress, etc., has generated a positive response from NASA and Harvard University whose representatives (the Director of NASA, former Congressman and astronaut Bill Nelson) and the physicist, astrophysicist, and university professor Avi Loeb) have publicly said that they will start investigating UFOs. The second directs the &#8220;Galileo Project&#8221; to try to look at scientific instruments to detect and analyze the behavior of UFOs. He reminds us of Galileo Galilei who dared to look through his telescope and detected that Jupiter had moons revolving around it. That is why he changed history and paradigms. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) has also just joined the UFO investigation. In the last 2-3 years Scientific American magazine also published articles on how valid and interesting UFO research can be for science. Already the subject is not only something of weak minds and crazy visionaries! (It never was).</p>\n<p>The UFO community in the US is eager for the US Congress to be encouraged to hold a public hearing about the UFO phenomenon. The last official hearing on this issue was in 1967!</p>\n<p>They materialize and dematerialize. They instantly accelerate to hypersonic speeds (5 to 25 times the speed of sound) and suddenly stop. They follow the planes. They contact people. They are shown to schoolchildren. The geospatial agency detected them coming from space. It goes without saying that the verification of a trans-ontological presence, which may well be physical or not, but which at least exceeds the classical space-time limits (with a more advanced technology detected historically and which does not belong to terrestrial humanity) is a fact with undeniable philosophical consequences. This collective realization may help us to get out of the global intellectual morass, to find new political-economic agreements, and to recognize that we are part of a much broader community of life that apparently spurs us to react and mature as a species in a more responsible and healthily connected way.</p>\n<p>We have to open our eyes to a larger reality that apparently was always here.</p>\n<div class=\"pk-clearfix\"></div>		<div class=\"pk-share-buttons-wrap pk-share-buttons-layout-default pk-share-buttons-scheme-default pk-share-buttons-has-counts

And that <strong>“Waking up”</strong> is greater freedom from form. And that we need both. Thanking about &#8220;worldviews&#8221; and promoting more inclusive worldviews will be necessary to help the emerging world community adapt to an extraterrestrial, multi-dimensional presence. The 8 worldviews presented by the New Paradigm Institute have been mapped horizontally. They can inform a most nutritious conversation but we also need to recognize a vertical, developmental dimension.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the most part, before the existence of Integral Theory these two factors (growing up and waking up) were confused or ‘confounded’ even by advanced, non-conventional thinkers and spiritual teachers. But now more than before we need to know about these distinctions in order to successfully come together as a species capable of caring for the planet and its life forms and – perhaps &#8211; achieving species-wide sovereignty in the eyes of more mature civilizations that overcame the challenges that we are facing now. Yes, we’ll likely have to learn to think integratively before we can magnificently join a more comprehensive cosmic community in a completely open fashion, a community (according to most contact experiencers) is composed of a majority of benevolent and/or apparently neutrally respectful civilizations some of which are conducting life-enhancing contact-medical-reproductive procedures as we would to a slightly developmentally inferior species. Moreover, the variety of craft and entity typologies observed suggest that they (or most of them) are already capable of collaborating with each other or of following agreed-upon rules in ways that we as a single species still can’t.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But to achieve equal status, not just in essence but in practical terms, a majority of humanity must grow up into post-conventional developmental levels and wake up into more stable, less- egoic, non-materialist states of awareness originating in the divine, Non-dual ground of being. Otherwise, infighting for dominance in order to impose narrow cultural interpretations will continue unabated and (based on the exponential dangers offered by technology) end in one form of a grand-scale catastrophe or another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blaine Snow (the author of the following article) was in my Integral Theory class and in his article he brings to light important overarching concepts and distinctions that I think must be understood by well-meaning progressive social activists. This is because they also ought to know some of the most fundamental issues behind human behavior and psychology before they half-hazardly promote social change. The developmental issues raised in the following article help us understand why we are as we are and why we come into conflict so often with each other. These issues speak about developmental stages that exist at the root of the types of worldviews we adhere to or, more poignantly, CAN adhere to. Thus, large-scale cultural shifts based on adopting more inclusive worldviews pertaining to consciousness and interconnection in a balanced way require an expansion of what awareness can take in in terms of “waking up” as in terms of “growing up.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More inclusive, even left-of-liberal, worldviews (mapped along a horizontal scale) can be worldviews capable of dealing with an active ET/NHI presence. This is because, if one carefully studies contact descriptions, we begin to see that the beings behind this presence apparently operate in multiple levels of physical and non-physical activity. Thus, in a “trans ontological” way that also appears to be semi-covert, semi-self-revelatory, partially interactive, and even mutually co-creative manner blending subjective and objective experiences). But to interpret this situation well would also require a corresponding higher, vertical, psychological development scale level (referred to in Blaine Snow’s article as “Growing Up” and as “Waking Up”). This is because, in order to be able to include more of reality not only cognitively but also identity-wise and ethically-wise (for example to be able to live up to the demands of the 8th Worldview), we need to expand our consciousnesses by developing vertically.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, we need to understand that the greatest challenge that humanity faces now (a challenge that will likely test to the limits the flexibility of our human nature or even activate something in us that makes it possible to expand) isn’t only about rationally agreeing upon a worldview and adopting new and better worldviews. It also is about expanding our consciousness by growing up vertically…developmentally. A balanced cross with intersecting vertical and horizontal axes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, once we get this necessary foundation for understanding, the question is how can we realistically promote post-conventional development (growing up) and also a (waking up) development towards universal awareness but on a massive, global scale, especially when tribalized and regressive authoritarian (pre-conventional and conventional) meaning-making is high jacking everyone’s attention and expanding so quickly in the world due to populist and business-based misuse of communication technology stimulating the lower rungs of human nature (an “us vs. them” polarization)?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Facts, reason, and logic do not seem to be enough…at least for most people excited by limited identity meaning-making. Since we are emotional meaning-makers that remember stories, should we talk about expansive realities using exciting stories? Should we simply brace up to bear the brunt of an upcoming multi-systemic crisis and inevitable personal suffering (even eventually extending to many of the most powerful in society)? Is there anything really capable of shaking us up one by one and globally out of our inability to abandon short-term decision-making, superficial status-seeking, selfish perspectivism, inadequate thinking, and widespread cynicism so that we can actually come together and agree? Will a formal, worldwide recognition of an extraterrestrial (and likely trans-ontological, i.e. “multidimensional”) presence be enough to shock us out of our smug complacency and mutual jealousy regarding who we think we are and what we think we know?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Self-discovery, self-correcting, ever-evolving, open cultures of inclusion, and fundamental connection should benefit from the notion that there are levels of development applicable to how we understand things, including why we are attracted to worldviews with similar characteristics. The conversation must be informed by different (ultimately compatible) angles supplementing what any one of them is not presenting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adopting more inclusive worldviews (for instance, left of  Liberal) would require correspondingly more inclusive developmental levels in terms both of &#8220;growing up&#8221; and of &#8220;waking up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The following are the eight NewParadigm Institute proposed worldviews- The 8th &#8220;Galactic&#8221; one would be most suited to live interacting in a healthy way with an extraterrestrial presence on Earth.</p>\n<table

Especially on the 60 cm long tridactyle humanoid named &#8220;Josefina&#8221; that not only has 3 fingers in hands and toes but also what seems to be three eggs inside her abdomen. Like a reptilian humanoid. The 128 cuts per square inch tomographies show that soft tissue is connected.  The &#8220;eggs&#8221; also show some structures inside.</p>\n<p>The specimens are being kept and studied in the Universidad Nacional San Luis Gonzaga located in the coastal town of Ica, Peru.  However, the Ministry of Culture wants to confiscate them.  Before, they said that the mummies were not part of the national patrimony and now they say that they are. From the very beginning, they were against the possibility of these bodies (found by grave robbers) being a unique discovery, although they were invited many times to participate in the investigation.  They also analyzed other specimens that probably were fake and generalized against all of the specimens.  It reminds me of the (now receding) anti-UFO attitude which is present all over modern institutions around the world.</p>\n<p>Most scientists (anthropologists and archaeologists) associated with this Ministry state that the mummies are obvious fakes or that they have been assembled either with modern materials or by using ancient human and animal bones. But there also is good scientific evidence that at least some of them are genuine and were living beings many centuries ago. Whether they were unknown species, human-ET hybrids, or ET remains to be found.</p>\n<p>Even if the remnants are not easily associated with a particular archaeological site or an ancient culture, the physical samples can indicate biological anomaly or uniqueness.</p>\n<p>One recent test conducted by the university was to insert a fine needle into one of the alleged eggs and (unlike the case if it had been a stone) it went through. Some material was extracted and I will try to find out if it was or will be tested.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-30261\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tridactilo-con-huevos-y-medidas-Josefina.jpg?resize=300%2C162&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"162\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tridactilo-con-huevos-y-medidas-Josefina.jpg?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tridactilo-con-huevos-y-medidas-Josefina.jpg?resize=1024%2C552&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tridactilo-con-huevos-y-medidas-Josefina.jpg?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tridactilo-con-huevos-y-medidas-Josefina.jpg?resize=1536%2C828&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Tridactilo-con-huevos-y-medidas-Josefina.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>An interesting event that keeps happening is the imaged energy coming out of the central part of Josefina&#8217;s chest implant.

Last year, President Trump signed an executive order stating America&#8217;s right to explore and use resources from the mining of resources on an asteroid, the Earth&#8217;s Moon, a moon of a nearby planet, or one of the nearby planets themselves. But there are realities that will postpone off-Earth mining for decades to come.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• The Moon is rich in metals like iron, aluminum, and titanium. But all of these are also found in great quantities on Earth. Going to the Moon to mine them would be like diving to the bottom of the ocean for a glass of water. According to experts, the Moon&#8217;s most critical resources are water, rare earth elements, and helium-3. Water would be useful for lunar agriculture or fuel, but certainly not worth bringing back to Earth. And ‘rare earth elements’ are about as common as most base metals on in the Earth&#8217;s crust.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• While 90% of the world&#8217;s rare Earth elements are mined in China, the main problem for rare earth production is we simply don&#8217;t have good technologies to commercially process these elements from different types of ore yet. Also, rare Earth elements production carries serious environmental risks.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Helium-3 may be the only resource worth bringing back to Earth for now. Helium-3 is a very rare gas that has the potential to be used as a fuel in future nuclear fusion. But what about the cost of getting there and back? Up until very recently, the expected cost of sending just one pound of material into orbit was over $10,000. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch vehicle has drastically brought down those cost expectations, and the company&#8217;s Smallsat Rideshare Program is aiming to reduce the cost of mass payloads into a sun-synchronous orbit for $1 million — or $2,500 per pound. But this is still far from economical. For example, if someone were so inclined to put a bulldozer into orbit for whatever reason, it would cost around $50 million. It would cost much more to get a dozer on the Moon to conduct a mining operation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Let&#8217;s imagine for a moment that a world-changing technology drastically reduces the cost of payload launch to pennies, so that the cost of transporting anything to the Moon is equal to transporting it on Earth. Mining isn&#8217;t just showing up and digging. Different types of surveys and mapping need to be completed, and the ideal location must be identified before exploration can begin. On Earth, the process can take five to 10 years. So even if someone started on a project to commercially mine on the Moon today, it would take at least a decade for anything to actually be produced.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Still, expect human beings to continue to push the space industry forward to improve our day-to-day lives on Earth. Just recently, a group of visionaries walked away from top-level positions at Apple, Amazon, SpaceX, and Tesla to join a small start-up company that&#8217;s aiming to create the first daily space delivery service in history. This firm builds rockets faster and 50 times smaller than anyone else in the industry. Says Jason Simpkins, investment director of Wall Street&#8217;s Proving Ground, “According to my calculations, this company’s enterprise value could grow 8,933% very soon&#8230; even if it captures just a modest share of this market.”</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-30223\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xdpg2wjv-1337049758.jpg?resize=300%2C148&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xdpg2wjv-1337049758.jpg?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xdpg2wjv-1337049758.jpg?resize=1024%2C504&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xdpg2wjv-1337049758.jpg?resize=768%2C378&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xdpg2wjv-1337049758.jpg?w=1356&amp;ssl=1 1356w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The idea of extraterrestrial mining has been around for more than a century.

In fact, human beings have never not mined in space. The Earth is flying around in what we call “space.” We&#8217;re in space right now. So what we&#8217;re really talking about is better called “extraterrestrial mining”&#8230; mining that&#8217;s done anywhere but Earth.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.outsiderclub.com/moon-mining-is-still-fiction-yet-the-space-industry-is-rallying/99748\">READ ENTIRE ARTICLE</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FAIR USE NOTICE: This page contains copyrighted material the use of which has not been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.

On the night of March 8, 1994, <span id=\"more-30144\"></span>Bushong couldn&#8217;t identify an illumination on the screen like he&#8217;d never seen before. When he called the emergency dispatcher in Ottawa County to see of they were picking it up, he learned that they were getting calls from the public and the police. The images on his radar screen corresponded with what people were reporting on the ground. But what was it? It was an object in the sky, but it wasn’t a meteorite or a radar glitch. Then the object broke apart and began hovering and making quick 20-mile “jumps” across the night sky. Then these separate objects appeared to form a wide triangle moving over Lake Michigan. (listen to 31:11 minute 911 recordings from the 1994 Lake Michigan UFO incident below)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Bushong spent his career with the National Weather Service, moving on to another meteorological station, received awards and finally retired on good terms. Some co-workers did ridicule him for what he claimed to have seen over Lake Michigan in 1994. “I kept my mouth closed, and I learned it pretty quickly,” he said. But Bushong was not alone. There have been considerable number of pilots and others have decided that it is better to keep quiet about such sightings – supported by a government policy to dismiss UFO sightings as a general thing.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• In the 1960s, then-US Congressman Gerald R. Ford of Grand Rapids, Michigan called for a parliamentary investigation and wrote a letter calling on the government to stop “misleading the people.” Well, after more than 50 years that intelligence report on UFOs was finally released in June 2021. The government finally admits that people have seen something that no one can explain. It even authenticated videos taken of UFOs by US military pilots. For Buchong, this was ‘vindication’ for man who tracked 1994 sightings on radar. It made him come out and talk again. Now he&#8217;s thinking of writing a book about the incident. “I think I was waiting for this proof,” he said.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• The 1994 Lake Michigan UFO sightings had a lasting impact on others who saw it. Holly Graves and her family were among the 911 callers watching the slowly spinning lights from their front yard. “It was like a Christmas illumination,” Graves recalled. The lakeside incident attracted a lot of media attention and she kept her children out of school for a while. “They really had a hard time,” Graves said. “They know what they saw, but it seems like everyone still laughed at you.” Her now adult children still don’t talk about sightings. “I’m glad my family saw it,” she says. “It’s like once in a lifetime. It’s the experience I bring to my grave with me.”</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_30147\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30147\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-30147\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mainUFOHolland1994-750x400-1.jpg?resize=300%2C160&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mainUFOHolland1994-750x400-1.jpg?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mainUFOHolland1994-750x400-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><strong>History&#8217;s depiction of the Lake Michigan lights</strong></figure>\n<p>Grand Rapids, Michigan (WOOD) — Jack Bushong was convinced he would lose his<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-30148\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/download-6.jpg?resize=175%2C288&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"175\" height=\"288\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"> job.</p>\n<p>It was the night of March 8, 1994.

Just imagine a civilization that predates us by a billion years,” said Loeb. &#8220;It&#8217;s enough time to send a chemically propelled spacecraft with artificial intelligence out into the world that is autonomous.” It has to behave autonomously because the distances between stars are very long. &#8220;All you need is one [civilization] &#8230;to populate the entire galaxy with self-replicating probes with AI.&#8221;</b></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-30083\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/artworks-000141403695-hg0edr-t500x500.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/artworks-000141403695-hg0edr-t500x500.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/artworks-000141403695-hg0edr-t500x500.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/artworks-000141403695-hg0edr-t500x500.jpg?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/artworks-000141403695-hg0edr-t500x500.jpg?resize=45%2C45&amp;ssl=1 45w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/artworks-000141403695-hg0edr-t500x500.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">A former CIA agent confessed to collecting devices &#8220;found inside alien abduction<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-30084\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?resize=45%2C45&amp;ssl=1 45w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/promotile_square2.jpg?w=940&amp;ssl=1 940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"> victims&#8221; in an old podcast that has resurfaced on Twitter.</p>\n<p>World-renowned alien hunter, author, and ex-CIA agent Derrel Sims appeared on the Into the Light paranormal podcast in 2015, where he spoke about his ground-breaking research during his 38-year career.</p>\n<p>In the broadcast, which is available on Apple Podcasts, Sims claims he has been hunting, researching, and collecting physical evidence left by alien contact and abduction and helps victims to come to grips with their experiences.</p>\n<p>He said: &#8220;Whenever I do my UFO investigations, a lot of people are always asking me to do that.

The Global Information Dominance Experiments, or GIDE, uses machine learning to sift through vast amounts of data <span id=\"more-30210\"></span>to notice tiny changes that humans might miss &#8211; such as the number of cars increasing or decreasing in a parking lot &#8211; which might indicate an evolving threat. The program can then alert human agents who can take a closer look.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• GIDE spurs faster decisions and provides proactive options by making new technologies more accessible and more effective, says General Glen VanHerck, commander of the US Northern Command. GIDE combines artificial intelligence and cloud computing resources with data from sources around the world to &#8216;achieve information dominance&#8217; and &#8216;decision-making superiority.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• The latest experiment – ‘GIDE 3’ &#8211; focused on &#8216;contested logistics&#8217; in a scenario where lines of communication in the Panama Canal were compromised, military officials said. It was conducted in conjunction with all 11 US combatant commands &#8216;collaborating in the same information space using the same exact capabilities&#8217;, said VanHerck. The new system represents a “leap forward in our ability to maintain domain awareness, achieve information dominance, and provide decision superiority in competition and crisis”.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Currently, VanHerck said, the agency is usually in a &#8216;reactive environment,&#8217; responding to rival nation&#8217;s actions. &#8216;We can set parameters where it will trip an alert to give you the awareness to go take another sensor such as GEOINT on-satellite capability to take a closer look at what might be ongoing in a specific location. What we&#8217;ve seen is the ability to get way further what I call left of being reactive to actually being proactive,” said VanHerck. “And I&#8217;m talking not minutes and hours, I&#8217;m talking days.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Established in 1958 at the height of the Cold War, the US Northern Command is responsible for defending North America primarily from air attacks (via NORAD) and providing maritime warning. The extra time offered by GIDE creates &#8216;decision space&#8217; for military brass to develop various deterrence strategies to present to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and president-for-now Biden. The US Air Force and Army are also leveraging AI to predict conflict scenarios.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• GIDE 3 also includes support from the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and Project Maven, a DoD sub-group that uses AI to sift through massive amounts &#8216;of persistent surveillance imagery&#8217; to quickly identify useful intel. “What we&#8217;re doing is making that data available and shared into a cloud where machine learning and artificial intelligence look at it,” VanHerck said. “They process it really quickly and provide it to decision-makers… This gives us days of advanced warning and ability to react.”</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-30213\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ccc-3.jpg?resize=299%2C168&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"168\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">The Pentagon is stealing a page from Minority Report with an experimental artificial-</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_30214\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30214\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30214\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/General-Glen-VanHerck.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/General-Glen-VanHerck.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/General-Glen-VanHerck.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/General-Glen-VanHerck.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/General-Glen-VanHerck.jpg?w=1308&amp;ssl=1 1308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><strong>                General Glen VanHerck</strong></figure>\n<p>intelligence program that can look &#8216;days in advance&#8217;

This is further enhanced by an overall increase in UK defense funding of £24 billion over the next four years, as announced by the Prime Minister last year.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Last year, Minister for Defence Procurement Jeremy Quin said, “As our adversaries advance their space capabilities, it is vital we invest in space to ensure we maintain a battle-winning advantage across this fast-evolving operational domain. The stand-up of Space Command is an exciting and important step in our commitment to operate in space effectively.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Under the leadership of Air Vice Marshal Paul Godfrey, the Joint Command will have oversight of all space capability development in the Ministry of Defence across three main areas; Space operations; Space workforce training and growth; and Space capability to develop and deliver space equipment programs. The UK Space Command headquartered at RAF High Wycombe will control all of Defence’s space capabilities, including the UK’s Space Operations Centre, RAF Fylingdales, SKYNET and other enabling capabilities. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston will run the RAF High Wycombe headquarters.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• Said Vice Marshal Paul Godfrey, “The space domain is vital, not just in enabling military operations across the world, but in the day to day lives of everyone across the nation. With our new headquarters officially open, UK Space Command is now on the path to lead UK space operations to protect UK and allied interests in space.”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>• UK Space Command carries the UK’s commitment to the Combined Space Operations initiative comprised of seven nations: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, UK and the US. The initiative seeks to improve cooperation, coordination, and interoperability opportunities in space, with main efforts focused on ensuring a safe, secure and stable space domain.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_30180\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30180\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-30180\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Vice-Marshal-Paul-Godfrey.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Vice-Marshal-Paul-Godfrey.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Vice-Marshal-Paul-Godfrey.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Vice-Marshal-Paul-Godfrey.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Air-Vice-Marshal-Paul-Godfrey.jpg?w=1067&amp;ssl=1 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><strong>           Air Vice Marshal Paul Godfrey</strong></figure>\n<p>A special ceremony yesterday marked the official opening of UK Space Command,</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_30181\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-30181\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-30181\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/UK-Space-Command-Badge.jpg?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/UK-Space-Command-Badge.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/UK-Space-Command-Badge.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/UK-Space-Command-Badge.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><strong>              UK Space Command badge</strong></figure>\n<p>with the first ‘Space Operator’ Badges presented to personnel.</p>\n<p>Space plays a vital role in the Armed Forces ability to undertake the majority of defence tasks, with any disruption to the space domain leading to significant consequences on civilian, commercial, economic and military activity.</p>\n<p>The stand-up of Space Command is a crucial step to ensure we protect UK interests in space and builds on the commitments outlined in the Defence Command Paper, to invest an additional £1.4 billion on<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-30182\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xx.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xx.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xx.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xx.jpg?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xx.jpg?resize=45%2C45&amp;ssl=1 45w, https://i0.wp.com/exonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/xx.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"> space over the next 10 years.
