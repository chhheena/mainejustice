However, in purported audio <a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-extraordinary-smear-of-rob-porter\">obtained</a> by the Daily Wire from', '2018, Willoughby said her allegations were &ldquo;not about our f-cking mariage&rdquo; and were meant to resonate with &ldquo;people who have been in abusive relationships.&rdquo;</p> <p>The conversations between Willoughby and Porter are from meetings they arranged after the Daily Mail story&rsquo;s publication, according to the Daily Wire. <strong><a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/08/14/cnn-rob-porter-keith-ellison/\">(RELATED: CNN Covered Rob Porter Allegations More Than 24 Times As Much As Ellison)</a></strong></p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible to be demonized in the media with falsehoods,&rdquo; Porter told the Daily Caller News Foundation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful people are now finally learning more of the reality and encourage everyone to read the whole story. I hope it serves as yet another reminder that agenda-driven, politicized stories disfigure the truth and that mob justice can be profoundly unjust.&rdquo;</p> <p>Willoughby notably told the Daily Mail that Porter once pulled her nude out of the shower by her shoulders and yelled at her. Nevertheless, she told Porter in 2018, &ldquo;I absolutely take issue with anyone who says you&rsquo;re an abuser,&rdquo; according to the Daily Wire.</p>\n<div id=\"outbrainPlaceholder\"></div> <div class=\"readmore\"></div> <div id=\"rev-more-content\"> <p>Willoughby would also tell people Porter&rsquo;s portrayal in media as an abuser&nbsp; &ldquo;is not what or who he is&rdquo; and that the allegations were &ldquo;sensationalized,&rdquo; according to the Daily Wire. She also told Porter that she in fact was the one who abused him, according to the outlet.</p> <p>&ldquo;Absolutely! I pushed you down the stairs in a fit of rage,&rdquo; she allegedly told Porter in one conversation, describing other instances in which she had &ldquo;been violent&rdquo; with him and &ldquo;abusive,&rdquo; the Daily Wire reported.</p> <div id=\"attachment_7501892\" style=\"width: 2570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7501892\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7501892 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-163x120.jpeg 163w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-620x455.jpeg 620w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-768x564.jpeg 768w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-1536x1127.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-2048x1503.jpeg 2048w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-915720302-70x52.jpeg 70w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-7501892\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p>\n</div> <p>Willoughby charges up to $10,000 per appearance for &ldquo;keynotes&rdquo; and &ldquo;workshops,&rdquo; according to an email obtained by the DCNF.

However, Willoughby expressed doubt to Porter about the legitimacy of the picture, telling Porter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t reel up and punch her in the face,&rdquo; according to the Daily Wire.</p> <p>Willoughby did not respond to the DCNF&rsquo;s request for comment, nor did the Daily Mail.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\">Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(Official White House photo by Adam Schultz)</figure>\n<p>U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a prominent Democrat from New York, earlier had to apologize publicly because she had let slip a statement that Joe Biden is now out of it, not running for president again in 2024.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s even though he&#8217;s said he plans to, when he would be well into his 80s.</p>\n<p>Now <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-maloney-biden-not-running-president-again-thought-off-record\">Fox News</a> says Maloney made the statement a second time.</p>\n<p>It happened when she was being interviewed by the New York Times and was asked about Biden&#8217;s next bid for the White House.</p>\n<p>He failed at two earlier attempts, before his campaign in 2020.</p>\n<p>The report explained Maloney &#8220;has made headlines with her wavering remarks about whether Biden is seeking re-election.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Off the record, he’s not running again,&#8221; Maloney responded to the Times&#8217; question.</p>\n<p>But the newspaper pointed out the interview was on the record.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the record? No, he should not run again,&#8221; Maloney said.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_582909\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-582909\" style=\"width: 596px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-582909\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rep_-Carolyn_Maloney.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"283\">U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.</figure>\n<p>Fox reported on the nuances of the responses: &#8220;In reporting, interview subjects can request to go off the record, meaning what they say won&#8217;t be publicly reported, but reporters generally need to agree to those terms beforehand if the subject wants to have those wishes honored. Reporters honor &#8216;off the record&#8217; requests by interview subjects in order to build trust with sources and learn valuable information they can verify elsewhere. It&#8217;s generally established both parties must be clear about what&#8217;s off the record, however, or what the interview subject has to say may be fair game for reporting. &#8221;</p>\n<p>The Fox report said the interview with Maloney was on Aug. 1, but the Times interview was published over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Maloney had what was described as &#8220;an awkward moment on CNN&#8221; earlier when she apologized directly to the camera on &#8220;New Day&#8221; for thinking Biden wouldn&#8217;t run again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mr. President, I apologize. I want you to run. I happen to think you won’t be running, but when you run or if you run, I will be there 100%. You have deserved it. You are a great president and thank you for everything you’ve done for my state and all the states and all the cities in America. Thank you, Mr. President,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Polls show members of the Democrat Party by overwhelming margins don&#8217;t want Biden back on their ticket in 2024. His approval rating has been among the lowest ever reported for a sitting president, and he&#8217;s created crises on the southern border, with massive inflation, surging interest rates, massive spending, new taxes and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/08/dam-breaks-dem-leaders-want-joe-biden-way-2024/\">WND previously reported</a> Democrats&#8217; defense of the gaffe prone, and often befuddled, Biden is falling by the wayside.</p>\n<p>It was Byron York, the chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-dam-breaks-and-key-dems-run-away-from-biden-24\"> revealed that the dam has broken, and key Democrats are running away from a Biden candidacy in 2024.</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen the polls showing that large majorities of Democratic voters want the party to pick a new nominee for president in 2024, bypassing incumbent President Joe Biden. Now we&#8217;re seeing the living embodiment of those polls as some important Democratic lawmakers distance themselves from, or outright oppose, a reelection run by the nearly 80-year-old president,&#8221; he wrote.</p>\n<p>He explained, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that senior Democrats are eager to disparage a president of their own party. They&#8217;re not. Instead, they&#8217;re being forced into it by the process of the 2022 campaign, in which they are trying to assure their own reelections. They&#8217;re campaigning, doing interviews, and taking part in debates, and the question comes up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He cited criticisms from Reps. Dean Phillips and Angie Craig of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>York explained, &#8220;Look at the polls. Last month, a New York Times/Siena College survey found that 64% of Democratic voters want a different nominee, while just 26% want the party to renominate Biden. And then a CNN poll showed that 75% — 75%! — of Democrats want a different nominee. Those are very big numbers,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

(Official White House photo by Adam Schultz)</figure>\n<p>The letter explained, &#8220;The FBI&#8217;s unprecedented raid of President Trump&#8217;s residence is a shocking escalation of the Biden administration&#8217;s weaponization of law-enforcement resources.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The American people deserve transparency and accountability from our most senior law-enforcement officials …. We will settle for nothing but your complete cooperation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The FBI launched its raid on Trump&#8217;s home last week, purportedly hunting for various documents. One report even widely claimed the papers concerned nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>Supporters of President Trump, however, consider it nothing other than the Democrats&#8217; fourth attempt at removing him from office or discouraging him from running in 2024.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already orchestrated two failed attempts, including one after he&#8217;d already finished his term, to remove him from office. Then there is her partisan Jan. 6 committee assigned to &#8220;investigate&#8221; Jan. 6, whose members have refused to allow testimony other than that which would damage Trump.</p>\n<p>The FBI raid is viewed by them as the fourth attempt to do the same thing.</p>\n<p>One expert even suggested that as all of their efforts have failed, he feared that Democrats would orchestrate an assassination of Trump.</p>\n<p>The Republicans told Garland, &#8220;Under your tenure, the Justice Department continues to shatter public confidence in the equal application of justice. The department has filed politically motivated lawsuits against Republican-led states on policies disfavored by the Biden administration, artificially inflated domestic violent extremism statistics to advance the Biden administration&#8217;s political narrative, used counterterrorism resources to target parents at school board meetings opposed to policies supported by the Biden administration, and selectively prosecuted and investigated political opponents of the Biden administration.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These actions not only undermine the stated mission of the department, they violate the most fundamental tenets of our country.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1332305\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1332305\" style=\"width: 596px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1332305\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/klain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"283\">Ron Klain, center, with President Obama</figure>\n<p>The letters set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Aug. 29.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition, please preserve all responsive documents in your possession, custody, or control. … This instruction includes all electronic messages sent using official and personal accounts or devices, including records created using text messages, phone-based message applications, or encryption software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The letters were signed by Reps.

Dinesh is a much greater intellectual than to produce a documentary in such regurgitating terms.</p>\n<p>What Dinesh did in &#8220;2000 Mules&#8221; was to examine the evidence for voter fraud in the 2020 election by tracking digital device location data of &#8220;mules,&#8221; or individuals who stuffed voter drop boxes with stacks of completed ballots, especially in <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/swing-states-presidential-elections\">swing states</a>.</p>\n<p>Before you criticize the premise as impossible, or believe someone else&#8217;s conclusions (even mine), you should watch the documentary (<a href=\"https://node-1.2000mules.com/\">available online</a>) and examine the evidence for yourself. It contains digital, telecommunication and video evidence of ballot box stuffing occurring by the same individual in multiples areas. As I&#8217;ll share in a moment, this all makes a huge difference because modern elections are now determined by drop-box and mailed ballots.</p>\n<p>Again, though Dinesh&#8217;s liberal critics have accused him of having &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2022/06/evidence-gaps-in-2000-mules/\">too many gaps</a>&#8221; in his evidence, I would say to them that his evidence between the alleged &#8220;gaps&#8221; is sufficient to make a case for examination. Any fraud is too much fraud, whether it was enough to sway the election or not.</p>\n<p>That is exactly what led a group of sheriffs across the country to question federal election integrity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/author-joshua-philipp\">Joshua Philipp</a>, an award-winning investigative reporter with The Epoch Times and host of <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/epochtv\">EpochTV&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Crossroads&#8221; program, reported in July how in one episode:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A group of sheriffs is launching an initiative to review and investigate evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-election-fraud\">election fraud</a> shown in the film &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-2000-mules\">2000 Mules</a>&#8221; by Dinesh D&#8217;Souza. The sheriffs are part of the <a href=\"https://cspoa.org/\">Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association</a> (CSPOA) and could bring criminal charges, depending on their findings.</p>\n<p>We speak with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-Mgbg_SLM\">Richard Mack</a>, former sheriff of Graham County, Arizona, and founder of CSPOA. He explains how sheriffs have begun their investigations, the laws separating the federal government from local law enforcement, and the importance of investigating election fraud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the federal government will not launch an investigation into mail ballot election fraud as they have on the Jan. 6 Capitol protests, then my wife, Gena, and I are in full support of these sheriffs and encourage other law enforcement across the land to join them.</p>\n<p>You can believe or disbelieve in 2020 election fraud; that is your American right. However, the question is: Is it possible that it really occurred in some way, shape, or form? Whether fraud contributed to the win or loss of your favorite candidate&#8217;s election is secondary compared to whether or not any form of corruption occurred in the national election.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws_in_the_United_States\">16 of the largest and most influential states</a> don&#8217;t even require identification verification when one votes (California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington, D.C.!), are we really that naïve to think &#8220;identity theft&#8221; (or forging votes) doesn&#8217;t occur with ballots?</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_identification_laws_in_the_United_States\">a couple dozen other states</a> just &#8220;request&#8221; and not &#8220;require&#8221; some form of official identification to vote, do we not think corrupt forms of &#8220;people proxy voting&#8221; occur, especially when so much is on the line with presidential elections?</p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://publicinterestlegal.org/press/groundbreaking-national-voter-roll-study-reveals-alarming-trends-as-states-prepare-to-vote-by-mail/\">Public Interest Legal Foundation</a> (PILF) published an official report based upon solid evidence that &#8220;tens of thousands of cases of possible voter fraud&#8221; occurred (including ID theft and dead people voting), shouldn&#8217;t our representatives seek election reform that at very least minimizes cheating?</p>\n<p>For example, the PILF discovered errors in elections dating back to the 2016 presidential election:</p>\n\n349,773 potentially deceased voting registrants across 41 states; Michigan, Florida, New York, Texas and California account for roughly 51% of national dead registrants.\n43,760 likely duplicate registrants appear to have cast second votes in 2016 from the same address.\n37,889 likely duplicate registrants appear to have cast second votes in 2018 from the same address. Thousands of these apparent double votes were exclusively mail ballots.\n8,360 – number of registrants apparently registered in two states and credited for voting in both states in 2018.\n5,500 – number of apparently duplicate registrants credited for voting twice in the same state from two different addresses in 2018.\n34,000 – number of registrants credited for voting from apparently non-residential addresses in 2018.\n\n<p>This kind of data is why the <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/tens-thousands-cases-possible-vote-fraud-cited-new-report\">Heritage Foundation</a> concluded, &#8220;The threat of vote fraud is real – and it could make a difference in a close election.&#8221; Like 2024?</p>\n<p>Election investigation is warranted right now based simply on the fact that Joe Biden received <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-popular-vote-record-barack-obama-us-presidential-election-donald-trump/\">13 million more votes</a> in 2020 than mega-popular Barack Obama did in 2008, when Obama set a record of votes for any presidential election before and despite Biden is the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-losing-key-independent-support-as-his-approval-rating-drops-lower\">most unpopular</a> presidential candidate and leader since the founding of our republic.</p>\n<p>Is it plausible that the least-popular candidate in history (Biden) could beat one of the most-popular incumbent presidents (Trump) by a record-breaking 7 million votes: Biden with <a href=\"https://www.cookpolitical.com/2020-national-popular-vote-tracker\">81,282,916 votes</a> compared to Trump with 74,223,369? Is it also plausible during a global pandemic that there would suddenly be an overall <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/\">7% increase</a> in voter turnout across the country in 2020 compared to 2016?</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s also suspect about those 7 million additional 2020 votes for Biden is the fact that the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/\">majority were received by mail</a>. Is it a mere coincidence (or &#8220;just because of COVID&#8221;) that, for the first time in 30 years, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-absentee-voting-looked-like-in-all-50-states/\">voting by mail soared across the country while voting in person dropped off the grid</a>? What a convenient, perfectly-timed political pandemic!</p>\n<p>Check out this graph:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5030291\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/norris220816-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"670\" height=\"602\"></p>\n<p>Bottom line: Is the extensive suspicion of election fraud (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/america-biden-election-2020-poll-victory\">held by more than 40% of Americans</a>) really far-fetched? Are sheriffs across the country wrong for investigating voter fraud now? Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>Gena and I thank, congratulate and commend Dinesh D&#8217;Souza in being willing to stand up for the truth, especially in the face of his own personal sacrifices and risks.</p>\n<p>You can like or dislike Dinesh or his documentaries, or even call him jaded and a demon, but you can&#8217;t deny the core of his facts, and the right that Americans have to know the truth.</p>\n<p>As our second president, John Adams, said, the people &#8220;have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge – I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>(Again, please watch ASAP the &#8220;2000 mules&#8221; documentary – </em><a href=\"https://node-1.2000mules.com/\"><em>available online</em></a><em> – and examine the evidence for yourself.)</em></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jim Jordan of Ohio. &#8220;There are lots of good people in the FBI. It&#8217;s the top that is the problem. Some of these good agents are coming to us, telling us what is baloney, what’s going on — the political nature now of the Justice Department — God bless them for doing it — talking about the school-board issue, about a whole host of issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The issue has been the weaponization of the federal government&#8217;s law enforcement, likely beginning under Barack Obama when the Internal Revenue Service openly targeted conservative and Christian organizations.</p>\n<p>At the end of Obama&#8217;s term, Democrats, the DOJ and the FBI worked together to fabricate the &#8220;Russiagate&#8221; claims against then-candidate Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The facts now reveal that it was Hillary Clinton who wanted to tie Trump to Russia as a distraction for her own email scandal, where she put government secrets on an unsecure server.</p>\n<p>But cooperating with her were her fans inside the FBI, where some members boasted of having an insurance policy against a Trump victory, and the DOJ, where her devotees approved using manufactured facts to obtain court permission to spy on Trump&#8217;s campaign.</p>\n<p>Now the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/jim-jordan-14-fbi-whistleblowers\"> Washington Examiner</a> is documenting the whistleblowing that is developing in the FBI.</p>\n<p>The report explained the congressman, who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News host Trey Gowdy the number has risen to 14 after the FBI raid at Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During a conversation about the politicization and weaponization of the DOJ, Jordan &#8220;made the case that the public has &#8216;figured it out&#8217; when it comes to what he characterized as the Left generating a lie, the &#8216;Big Media&#8217; reporting the lie, Big Tech amplifying the lie, and then both piling on Republicans when they catch on and say something,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n<p>He had pointed out only recently that several FBI whistleblowers had brought forward information about the DOJ&#8217;s scheme to investigate parents who object to local school boards&#8217; aggressive anti-parent and leftist agendas.</p>\n<p>On the Senate side, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, also has confirmed his team had gotten details for whistleblowers, including disclosures related to the federal investigation into Hunter Biden, whose schemes to make money from selling access to his father, as vice president and now has president, have alarmed many.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is becoming a well-worn trail of agents who say, &#8216;This has got to stop.&#8217; And thank goodness for them,&#8221; Jordan said on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Analysts expect the GOP to be the majority in the U.S. House after November&#8217;s elections, which will allow the party to carry out hearings, reviews and investigations of allegations of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Trump walks across the South Lawn of the White House after disembarking Marine One Sunday, June 14, 2020, concluding his trip to Bedminster, New Jersey. (Official White House photo by Tia Dufour)</figure>\n<p>Paul Sperry is a former Washington bureau chief for Investor&#8217;s Business Daily, a Hoover Institute media fellow and has written multiple books including the best-selling &#8220;Infiltration.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now he&#8217;s reporting on <a href=\"https://gettr.com/user/paulsperry\">GETTR</a> that Hillary Clinton acolytes worked secretly with the Department of Justice on the FBI&#8217;s raid on President Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago home.</p>\n<p>Further, they launched their attack on the possible 2024 GOP candidate for president based on his alleged possession of the type of records other president have taken home with them, and over which they have faced no investigation whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Sperry points out that David Laufman, &#8220;recycled bad guy of Russiagate,&#8221; is claiming that &#8220;evidence&#8221; seized &#8220;validates&#8221; the government&#8217;s search.</p>\n<p>However, &#8220;One Senate investigator told RealClearInvestigations that Laufman, then Justice’s top counterintelligence official, was the &#8216;mastermind&#8217; behind the strategy to dust off and &#8216;weaponize&#8217; FARA against Trump campaign officials,&#8221; creating the Russiagate disaster, the reporting explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Laufman signed off on the illegal wiretapping of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. An Obama campaign donor, Laufman helped oversee a wide range of politically charged cases as the DoJ’s counterintelligence section chief – including the department’s highly irregular, kid-gloves investigation of Hillary Clinton concerning her mishandling of classified emails as secretary of state.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sperry described Laufman as &#8220;the king of phony pretexts&#8221; to justify investigating Trump.</p>\n<p>Russiagate, of course, was the manufactured scheme that was used by Democrats and the DOJ against Trump before his 2016 election and then for years into his term. Facts now reveal that Hillary Clinton had told others she was planning to tie Trump to Russia, and then her operatives and those in the DOJ and FBI took off running with the false claims, even submitting manufactured evidence to a federal court to get permission to spy on Trump campaign staffers.</p>\n<p>Sperry explained, &#8220;Sources say Hillary Clinton operatives have been secretly working with Archives officials and the Justice Department for several months and are behind the push for the investigation of Trump as &#8216;revenge&#8217; for Clinton being investigated for mishandling classified materials in her Emailgate scandal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Identified as &#8220;conflicted&#8221; DOJ officials on the raid were Nicholas McQuaid, who worked with Hunter Biden&#8217;s criminal attorney, Lisa Monaco, a Barack Obama aide implicated in Russigate, and Maggie Goodlander, the spouse of top Biden aide Jake Sullivan, who was implicated in Russiagate.</p>\n<p>Sperry reported, &#8220;Sources say the FBI agents and officials who were involved in the raid on former President Trump&#8217;s home work in the same CounterIntelligence Division of the FBI that investigated Trump in the Russiagate hoax and are actively under criminal investigation by Special Counsel John Durham for potentially abusing their power investigating Trump in the Russian fraud and therefore have a potential conflict of interest and should have been RECUSED from participating in this supposed &#8216;espionage&#8217; investigation at Mar-a-Lago.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He explained the Russiagate conspiracy theory was launched originally based on some esoteric Foreign Agents Registration Act technicality, while the most recent assault against Trump was based on a records requirement.</p>\n<p>He warned of the consequences of ignoring the manipulations that appear to be going on inside the federal government under Joe Biden.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We only become a police state if police and intelligence abuses aren&#8217;t fully exposed and punished and corrected and prevented from happening again through another Church Committee and tougher legislation. Democrats and their poodles in the press won&#8217;t help with that. They are complicit in the abuses and part of the cover-up. That leaves milquetoast RINO &#8216;leaders&#8217; like Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell as the Republic&#8217;s saviors, along with Special Counsel John Durham, who is operating on a shoestring budget and skeletal staff and moving at a non-aggressive, non-urgent, glacial pace. We are doomed,&#8221; he wrote.</p>\n<p>He pointed out, &#8220;No former president has ever been prosecuted for shipping his presidential papers from the White House to his private residence where he has a SCIF to secure any classified documents he&#8217;s already reviewed, and no former president has ever been prosecuted for shipping his presidential records with him so he can write his memoir and archive them at his presidential library. No president, that is, until Trump.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The manipulations of facts go as high as U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When AG Garland at his press conference insisted he had no choice but to take the invasive measure of an armed raid on Trump&#8217;s home after ostensibly exhausting less Draconian options, he left out the fact that he had already ordered an equally invasive measure of seizing the security surveillance video of Mar-a-Lago and effectively spying on the comings and goings of Trump and his family and visitors for two months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The suggestion that Democrats now are suddenly concerned about nuclear secrets seems implausible, too, he suggested.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Recall how Dems and MSM didn&#8217;t give a rip about &#8216;national security&#8217; when President Clinton: &#8212; declassified tens of thousands of pages of secrets about our nuclear weapons program; &#8212; transferred dual-use missile and other technology to China; and, &#8212; kicked open the doors to Los Alamos and our other nuclear weapons labs to Chinese scientists. Beijing subsequently stole the designs to every nuclear warhead in the US arsenal, including MIRVs, according to the Cox Report, and now China can independently target Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Francisco with a single ICBM.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also reported the FBI paperwork authorizing the raid on Trump&#8217;s home allowed agents to seize any boxes &#8220;in proximity&#8221; to any targeted papers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is Russiagate 2.0. They were busted trying to frame Trump as a traitor previously, and now they&#8217;re launching a new witch hunt in a desperate attempt to suspend disbelief about their guilt in the last witch hunt. This new frame-up also serves as a way to dirty him up heading into 2024, seeing how their Jan. 6 pre-impeachment effort has failed,&#8221; he charged.</p>\n<p>There is, however, one problem that likely will develop for Democrats, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It turns out that those working for Trump at his Florida estate during the FBI raid refused FBI requests to turn off security cameras on the premises, which means Trump now has footage ready-made for an explosive campaign commercial.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Further, Sperry reported, &#8220;Former FBI counterintelligence agent and attorney Mark Wauck calls &#8216;logical&#8217; the possibility the FBI was really trying to cover its own tracks in the Mar-a-Lago raid by searching for damaging #Spygate #Russiagate documents Trump may possess:.&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

He had reposted an image from political activist and actor Laurence Fox.</p>\n<p>The officers went back to his property the next day, but were refused access, so they arrested him, the report said.</p>\n<p>Jones noted, &#8220;When incidents on social media receive not one but two visits from police officers, but burglaries and non-domestic break-ins don&#8217;t always get a police response, something is wrong.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Institute explained, &#8220;Harry Miller, who recently won a High Court case in which judges ruled that the College of Policing’s guidance on the recording of non-hate crime incidents was unlawful, said the awareness courses were deeply worrying.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is all about re-education and indoctrination.

There was little consultation or collaboration between key stakeholders, both inside and outside the club.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hasler said the intent was to provide support for &#8220;all diverse groups,&#8221; but the poor management of the situation caused &#8220;confusion, discomfort and pain for many people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.christian.org.uk/news/australian-rugby-league-players-refuse-to-wear-lgbt-kit/\">Christian Institute</a> reported Sea Eagles captain Daly Cherry-Evans &#8220;warned other clubs not to force players to back specific causes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While team owner Scott Penn claimed that the seven players would be open to wearing the rainbow jersey in the future, if properly consulted, a representative of the players said that&#8217;s nonsense.</p>\n<p>The players will not &#8220;backflip on religious beliefs,&#8221; the spokesman said, and suggestions they would cave to LGBT pressure was &#8220;totally untrue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Institute reported, &#8220;Rev. Dr. Ma’afu Palu from the Tongan Evangelical Wesleyan Church said he was &#8216;very proud&#8217; of the players’ stand. &#8216;Christianity takes a very strong root in our people,&#8217; he explained. &#8216;Whatever the Bible says is very authoritative to us.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>A similar exhibition of courage appeared in the United States earlier in the year, when five Tampa Bay Rays baseball players refused to be forced to promote the LGBT lifestyle choices.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.
