Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.\n\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.\n\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.\n\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s.

While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.\n\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?\n\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.\n\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.\n\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.\n\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.\n\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:\n\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another.

But the elite are not allowing us to enjoy the benefits of his real legacy. The elite were threatened by Tesla and his vision of a positive future for humanity.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n73 years after the FBI seized nearly TWO TRUCKS of papers of one of the world’s most famous inventors, the Federal Bureau of Investigations released the documents to the public. The batch of documents made available through the Freedom of Information Act also reveal Tesla did not die on January 7, 1943, as previously believed, but a day later on January 8.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn general, the FBI documents revealed a number of details that changed a lot of what we know about Tesla, his life, his inventions and his legacy. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this video, we take a look at seven ‘lost’ inventions by Tesla, which many people are unaware of.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n1. Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology\n\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.\n\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.\n\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.\n\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.\n\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray\n\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.\n\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.\n\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”\n\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity\n\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.\n\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.\n\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.\n\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.\n\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?\n\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.\n\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

More recently, analysts have alleged that the Chinese government is sterilizing women in Xinjiang, a province with a large population of Uighur Muslims.\n\nIt doesn’t take a massive leap of the imagination to see how the aims of South Africa’s anti-fertility vaccine project would have benefited from research into self-spreading vaccines. These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

Terrified, they hid in some bushes and looked up.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n\n<div id=\"M824013ScriptRootC1347179\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Minutes later, they heard the scream of a jet aircraft going north: In 1990, RAF Leuchars in Fife had two squadrons of Tornado fighters on 24-hour standby to intercept Russian intruder aircraft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jet came back and circled the ‘thing’ before heading off on its original course, as if the pilot had seen the object too and had come back for a closer look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually the two men stuck their camera out from where they were hiding and fired off six frames. At that point, the object shot vertically upwards and disappeared way, way up in to the sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convinced they’d just seen a UFO, they took their photos to the Daily Record, one of Scotland’s leading newspapers. But no story was ever printed: The paper passed the pictures on to the Ministry of Defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the photographs simply vanished — along with the two young chefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now. Here, for the first time, we can reveal that missing picture — a photograph one MoD insider described as the most spectacular UFO picture ever captured, and the Holy Grail in terms of hard evidence that these things really exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a picture the MoD and The National Archives have tried their utmost to keep hidden. While the information would normally have been released after 30 years, the Ministry has not released the original photo and wants the names of the witnesses sealed for a further 54 years — until 2076 — because of ‘privacy concerns’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a university lecturer and investigative reporter who’s spent three decades immersed in the world of UFOlogy, I heard the story of the mysterious ‘Calvine file’ — as the missing photo and report of that incident at Calvine came to be known — many moons ago and have devoted the past 13 years doggedly searching for the images the men took.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happened to the file, the men who pictured the UFO and how and why its very existence has been suppressed for 32 years, was a puzzle I was determined to crack. Wherever I searched for answers, however, I found insiders blocking my inquiries — until I struck lucky and found retired RAF officer Craig Lindsay, the first official to speak to one of the young chefs after that night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was willing to talk to me and, most exciting of all, I discovered that he’d broken protocol that day and stashed a copy of the image before, on Whitehall’s orders, sending the entire dossier — negatives included — to the Ministry of Defence in London.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’d kept the secret copy in his desk for 32 years — hidden inside his copy of Great Aircraft Of The World. When I eventually tracked him down, now 83 and still living in Scotland, he sounded almost relieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I have been for waiting for someone to contact about this for more than 30 years,’ he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what do I make of it? The moment Craig showed the photograph to me I knew I was looking at something exceptional. Yes, it is a black and white image, printed on colour paper, and the trees and fence look a little blurry, as if the photographer took it in a moment of panic — which is consistent with their story. But the camera is focused on the weird diamond shaped object in the centre of the frame. Unlike many other UFO images, this is clearly a structured craft of unknown origin. It looks other-worldly and unlike any conventional aircraft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is by far the best UFO photograph I have ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe me, I’m no gullible, deluded conspiracy theorist. I’d grown cynical after viewing hundreds of unconvincing photographs and films: Blurry, grainy, out of focus shots of what easily could have been frisbees, streetlamps or even seagulls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this was clearly something different. I’ve since had it analysed by Andrew Robinson, a senior lecturer in photography at Sheffield Hallam University. He is convinced it is genuine, and if it is a hoax, then a highly elaborate one, involving expensive, sophisticated equipment and flying models, not at the disposal of two jobbing hotel chefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told me: ‘My conclusion is that the object is definitely in front of the camera, that is, it’s not a fake produced in post-production, and its placement within the scene appears to be approximately halfway between the foreground fence and the plane in the background.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Lindsay, a pragmatic, logical former civil servant who spent ten years in the military, is convinced the image — and the frightened man he spoke to on that day — are genuine. Initially, he was worried about speaking to me in case he was in breach of the Official Secrets Act. But after 32 years of doing what he was told, and keeping quiet, he now wants the truth to emerge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As a press officer for Scotland, I dealt with many UFO reports but most were just of lights in the sky. It was obvious this one was different. When I asked what sort of noise it had made, the man said, “It didn’t make any noise at all.” Up to that point I wasn’t treating it very seriously but when he said it was silent, I suddenly realised there is no aircraft that I know of that is silent.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lindsay arranged for the negatives the men had handed to the Daily Record to be collected and faxed a copy of the best print to the Ministry of Defence’s now-defunct UFO desk in London.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Before I could even get back to my desk the phone was ringing and my contact said, “Tell me more about this. Can you get the negatives?”’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he visited the MoD later that year, however, he saw the Calvine photo blown up to poster size on the UFO office wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I asked how they were getting on. They said it was being investigated. I was told to “leave it to London”… they asked me not to get involved, so I have done exactly that,’ he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The years passed and gradually I just forgot about the print in my drawer. Now I hope the two witnesses will come forward and tell their own stories.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope so too. My interest in UFO sightings started in the 1990s when, working as a journalist in Yorkshire, I began using the Freedom of Information Act to request access to MoD files on famous UFO sightings such as the Rendlesham Forest incident that is often called Britain’s Roswell (an incident in 1947 in New Mexico long believed to have been a cover-up of UFO evidence).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2008, shortly before the MoD disbanded their UFO desk, I had become such an authority on the MoD files that I was offered the opportunity to curate the release of thousands of once secret UFO papers at The National Archives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In here, among the hundreds of drawings from schoolchildren and letters from UFO conspiracy theorists demanding to know where the aliens were being kept, I found a poor-quality, photocopied drawing of a UFO with a Harrier beside it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, even more intriguingly, alongside the image there was a briefing prepared for Defence Ministers in Margaret Thatcher’s government of the time if they were approached to comment on the sighting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wording was vague and non-committal, the typical ‘swatting away’ investigators are used to. Under the sub-heading ‘Defensive Lines to Take’ is the official response the MoD should give, if asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Have looked at the photographs, no definite conclusions reached regarding large diamond-shaped object. Confident that jet aircraft is a Harrier. Have no record of Harriers operating in location at stated date/time. No other reports received by MoD of unusual air activity or sightings at location/date/time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I checked, but of course, no one did ask. The story was immediately shelved. I went looking for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the sparse MoD papers on the Calvine sighting were declassified, the names of the photographer (and Craig Lindsay) were removed from the file under Data Protection laws. Normally, these would have been released after 30 years — on January 1, 2020 — but the MoD and The National Archives continue to insist they must be kept secret for another 54 years — until 2076 — because of ‘privacy concerns’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the Daily Record’s decision not to publish the story is intriguing. Had it been spiked by a D-Notice — a gagging order based on national security concerns, served by the MoD?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this might sound like something from TV’s The X-Files, some clever sleuthing by my fellow UFOlogist Matthew Illsley discovered that the Record’s editor, the late Endell Laird, had been a member of the MoD’s D-Notice committee at the time. A coincidence?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthew from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire is challenging the extended closure decision that he says is unjustified, asking: ‘What have they got to hide after all these years?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;it? Sadly, I do not think that mysterious aircraft arrived from another galaxy. I believe it was man-made somewhere in a secret hangar — and whatever it was remains on the secret list and highly sensitive. The witnesses had simply been in that ‘million to one’ chance of being in that particular place at that particular time, and needed to be shut up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, this was 1990, the Cold War was still a year away from thawing. The Gulf War started literally days earlier. The world was — as many would argue it still is today — divided along ‘them and us’ battle lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the mid-Eighties, there had been rumours of a top secret, exotic, American reconnaissance aircraft named ‘Aurora’ — a silent, supersonic, geometrically shaped craft, used for spy missions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there has never been any substantial evidence that it was ever built or flown, there have been numerous unexplained sightings and incidents in both the US and the UK over the years that have fuelled the Aurora myth — Calvine included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1991, Defence Ministers denied in Parliament that the US had been given permission to fly or land their secret spy plane in UK airspace after reports that Aurora had been spotted leaving RAF Machrihanish on the Mull of Kintyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But papers I obtained using the Freedom of Information Act suggest that some MoD intelligence officers did believe Aurora existed but were not allowed to say anything publicly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A source in the MoD tells me that once Britain’s intelligence chiefs realised the Calvine photographs showed a top secret US project they were immediately classified secret — UK Eyes Only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last June, the Pentagon released its long-awaited report on what it now calls UAPs or ‘unidentified aerial phenomena’ after a spate of similar sightings and the release of films showing fast-moving UFOs taken by US Navy pilots. The new American UAP Task Force listed five categories that most sightings, when resolved, would likely fall into — and one of these is ‘classified programs’ developed by the US government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am convinced the Calvine photograph shows one of these classified programs. Meanwhile, the American, and possibly our own, government have found it useful to ‘keep the myth of UFOs flying’ because it provides a useful cover for their own covert military activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in this case their cover was blown by two young men who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The MoD must explain to the public why, if there are no such things as UFOs, how they can justify keeping their identities secret for a further 54 years. And it also needs to explain what happened to the negatives and their file on the case — otherwise they are simply adding further grist to the mill of the conspiracy theorists who believe the authorities are hiding ‘the truth’ about visits to Earth by aliens.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4.

Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6.

Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca.

He believed it could bring his lab international acclaim and funding.

European countries, including Sweden and Switzerland, sterilized members of the Roma minority in the early half of the 20th century and some, like Slovakia, continued even beyond that.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.\n\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?\n\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.\n\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.\n\nWhile researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons.

href=\"https://fctc.who.int/who-fctc/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IHR framework already&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dailysceptic.org/2022/05/11/the-biggest-global-power-grab-we-have-seen-in-our-lifetimes-how-serious-is-the-threat-from-the-who-pandemic-treaty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">allows</a>&nbsp;the WHO director-general to declare a public health emergency in any country, without the consent of that country’s government, though the framework requires the two sides to first attempt to reach an agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dailysceptic.org/2022/05/11/the-biggest-global-power-grab-we-have-seen-in-our-lifetimes-how-serious-is-the-threat-from-the-who-pandemic-treaty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">proposals</a>&nbsp;for a new or revised pandemic treaty, put forth at the special ministerial session of the WHO in May, would “somewhat” strengthen the WHO’s pandemic-related powers, including establishing a “Compliance Committee” that would issue advisory recommendations for states.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dailysceptic.org/2022/05/11/the-biggest-global-power-grab-we-have-seen-in-our-lifetimes-how-serious-is-the-threat-from-the-who-pandemic-treaty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to the Daily Sceptic</a>, while the IHR is already legally binding, the amendments proposed in May would not strengthen existing legal obligations or requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The existing treaty regulations, like all (or most) international law, do not actually compel states to do anything other than talk to the WHO and listen to it, and neither do they specify sanctions for non-compliance; almost all their output is advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The proposed amendments don’t alter that. They don’t allow the WHO unilaterally to impose legally binding measures on or within countries.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Daily Sceptic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dailysceptic.org/2022/05/11/the-biggest-global-power-grab-we-have-seen-in-our-lifetimes-how-serious-is-the-threat-from-the-who-pandemic-treaty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">noted</a>&nbsp;one of the risks stemming from the negotiations for a new or updated treaty include the potential codification of “the new lockdown orthodoxy for future pandemics,” which would “replace the sound, science-based, pre-COVID recommendations” previously in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pandemic-treaty-world-health-organization-cola/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to Dr. Joseph Mercola</a>, such a treaty would grant the WHO “absolute power over global biosecurity, such as the power to implement digital identities/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mercola also questioned a “one-size-fits-all approach to pandemic response,” pointing out that “pandemic threats are not identical in all parts of the world. In his view, he said, “the WHO is not qualified to make global health decisions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar concerns contributed at least in part to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1OxAxIuVNU&amp;ab_channel=TheHill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opposition</a>&nbsp;against the proposals presented at the special ministerial

rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Reuters reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mxolisi Nkosi, South Africa’s ambassador to the UN, told the WHO’s annual ministerial assembly the new special session would “consider the benefits for such a convention, agreement or other international instrument.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nkosi added:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Probably the most important lesson COVID-19 has taught us is the need for stronger and more agile collective defences against health threats as well as for building resilience to address future potential pandemics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A new pandemic treaty is central to this.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, the U.K.’s ambassador to the UN, Simon Manley, addressing the lack of an immediate agreement and the consensus to hold a new meeting, <a

Health International speculated that any final agreement may simply strengthen the existing IHR or, alternatively, may involve an amendment to the WHO’s constitution — or both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just two days after the July 21 INB agreement, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1550848707737931777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

considering targeted amendments to the [IHR], incl. ways to improve the process for declaring a [public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC].”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1550848707737931777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">thread</a>, he also declared the ongoing&nbsp;<a

of international concern,” one “that is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, the WHO director-general&nbsp;<a

COVID-19, monkeypox and polio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>BUSY SUMMER FOR VACCINE PASSPORT PROPOSALS</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WHO and global governments weigh plans for an updated or new pandemic treaty, other organizations are moving forward on vaccine passport technologies and partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 8, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of many of the world’s industrialized nations,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.efe.com/efe/espana/politica/espana-y-la-ocde-impulsan-unificacion-de-certificados-covid-en-el-mundo/10002-4847183\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a>&nbsp;it would promote the unification of the different&nbsp;<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/us-developing-vaccine-passport-system/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vaccine passport systems</a>&nbsp;currently in use around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thirty-six countries and international organizations participated in a July meeting with the goal of “creating a multilateral framework for establishing a global vaccine passport regime,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/21-african-countries-just-quietly-embraced-vaccine-passports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to</a>&nbsp;Nick Corbishley of Naked Capitalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development is a continuation of efforts involving the WHO to harmonize global vaccine passport regimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February, the WHO&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/archive/covid-19-who-commissions-t-systems-648634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">selected</a>&nbsp;Germany’s T-Systems as an “industry partner to develop the vaccination validation service,” which would enable “vaccination certificates to be checked across national borders.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T-Systems, an arm of Deutsche Telekom, was previously instrumental in developing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/21-african-countries-just-quietly-embraced-vaccine-passports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interoperability</a>&nbsp;of vaccine passport systems in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in July, 21 African governments “<a href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/21-african-countries-just-quietly-embraced-vaccine-passports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">quietly embraced</a>” a vaccine passport system, which in turn would also be interlinked with other such systems globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On July 8, which is also Africa Integration Day, the African Union and the Africa Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c80w27r8xkno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a>&nbsp;a digital vaccine passport valid throughout the African Union,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/21-african-countries-just-quietly-embraced-vaccine-passports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">describing</a>&nbsp;it as “the e-health backbone” of Africa’s “new health order.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This follows the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/07/21-african-countries-just-quietly-embraced-vaccine-passports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">development</a>&nbsp;in 2021, of

It encompasses six areas of focus, including “health” and “digital cooperation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of health, the agreement purports that it will “support countries [sic] achieve good health and well-being for all, within the context of the 2030 Agenda, focusing on key emerging global health threats that require stronger multistakeholder partnership and action.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, the “digital cooperation” promoted by the agreement will purportedly “meet the needs of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/focus/fourth-industrial-revolution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fourth Industrial Revolution</a>&nbsp;while seeking to advance global analysis, dialogue and standards for digital governance and digital inclusiveness.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, despite rhetoric preaching “inclusiveness,” individuals and entities that have refused to go along with applications such as vaccine passports have faced repercussions in their personal and professional lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such was the example of a Canadian doctor who was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/doctor-is-fined-for-refusing-to-use-canadas-vaccine-passport/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fined</a>&nbsp;$6,255 in June over her refusal to use the country’s ArriveCAN health information app — which is being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/canadas-vaccine-passport-faces-federal-privacy-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investigated</a>&nbsp;over privacy concerns — to enter the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Ann Gillies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/canadian-doctor-fined-6000-for-refusing-to-use-travel-app-says-medical-history-none-of-feds-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a>&nbsp;she was fined when re-entering Canada after attending a conference in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Bud, the CEO of biometric ID company iProove, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security contractor,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sikhfortruth/status/1496098251661000709\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">described</a>&nbsp;vaccine certificates as driving “the whole field of digital ID in the future,” adding they are “not just about COVID [but] about something even bigger” and that “once adopted for COVID [they] will be rapidly used for everything else.”</p>\n\n                         <div class=\"abh_box abh_box_down abh_box_business\">\n <a href=\"#abh_about\">About</a> <a href=\"#abh_posts\">Latest Posts</a>\n\n<div class=\"abh_tab_content\">\n<div class=\"abh_image\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/cyrus/\" class=\"url\" title=\"Sean Adl-Tabatabai\"><img alt=\"Sean Adl-Tabatabai\" src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/1511651_10152594103870715_1942518842_o.jpg.optimal.jpg\" class=\"avatar 2x photo\" width=\"80\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"abh_social\"> </div>\n<div class=\"abh_text\">\n<h3 class=\"fn name\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/cyrus/\" class=\"url\">Sean Adl-Tabatabai</a></h3>\n<div class=\"abh_job\"></div>\n<div class=\"description note abh_description\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"abh_image\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/cyrus/\" class=\"url\" title=\"Sean Adl-Tabatabai\"><img alt=\"Sean Adl-Tabatabai\" src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/1511651_10152594103870715_1942518842_o.jpg.optimal.jpg\" class=\"avatar 2x photo\" width=\"80\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"abh_social\"> </div>\n<div class=\"abh_text\">\n<h4>Latest posts by Sean Adl-Tabatabai <span class=\"abh_allposts\">(<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/cyrus/\">see all</a>)</span>\n</h4>\n<div class=\"abh_description note\">									<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/cia-chief-we-will-execute-trump-if-hes-found-guilty/\">CIA Chief: &#8216;We Will EXECUTE Trump If He’s Found Guilty&#8217;</a><span> -

His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLl9RSVdlaFZsNzRz</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 10, 2022 9:34 am</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlZ1Y1pZcXdMVGpj\" data-date=\"1660000250\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-video-title=\"The Global Elites Are Normalizing Pedophilia\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VucZYqwLTjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Governments across the world, operating under the control of the World Economic Forum, are waging war on our children.

Very,” before walking off camera.\n\nHis bizarre video was quickly topped a few seconds later when Geller posted an even more outrageous letter to Putin, threatening to use “every last molecule of my mind power to prevent you from launching a nuclear attack”.\n\nGeller then asked readers to take ‘”five seconds out of your day to visualise a radiant, energetic force field…like a dazzling, golden shield in the sky” that he claimed would deflect any nuclear warheads deployed by the Kremlin, turning them back to destroy Russia.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmRDTnlIbTJ6WTlN</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 5, 2022 10:25 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ\" data-date=\"1659648584\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-video-title=\"UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7URELIJsblY/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The United Nations has declared war on conspiracy theories, describing the rise of conspiracy thinking as “worrying and dangerous”, and providing the public with a toolkit to “prebunk” and “debunk” anybody who dares to suggest that world governments are anything but completely honest, upstanding and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN also warns that George Soros, the Rothschilds and the State of Israel must not be linked to any “alleged conspiracies.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO has teamed up with Twitter, the European Commission and the World Jewish Congress to launch the campaign dubbed #ThinkBeforeSharing: Stop the spread of conspiracy theories.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN wants you to know that events are NOT “secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent” and if you encounter anybody who thinks the global elite are conspiring to consolidate power and dictate global events, you must take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to UNESCO, “if you are certain you have encountered a conspiracy theory” on the internet then you must post a relevant link to a “fact-checking website” in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Never mind the fact that “fact checkers” are mostly untrained and unqualified hacks performing “fact checks” from their bedroom in between posting far-left political content and getting high.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO also provide advice for anyone who encounters a real live conspiracy theorist in the flesh.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

As time goes on and the AI practices with more learning sets, it begins to identify the kinds of content moderating teams would find offensive, reaching “<em>near-perfect detection”</em> at a massive scale,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldberger said the system would protect against “<em>increasingly advanced actors misusing platforms in unique ways.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust and safety teams at online media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, bring a “<em>nuanced comprehension of disinformation campaigns”</em> that they apply to content moderation, said Goldberger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes working with government organizations to filter content communicating a narrative about COVID-19, for example. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Big Tech companies on what types of content to label as misinformation on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media companies have also targeted conservative content, including posts that negatively portray abortion and transgender activism, or contradict the mainstream understanding of climate change, by either labeling them as “<em>misinformation</em>” or blocking them entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WEF document did not specify how members of the AI training team would be decided, how they would be held accountable or whether countries could exercise controls over the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elite business executives who participate in WEF gatherings have a track record of proposals that expand corporate control over peoples’ lives.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail confirms that Pierre and Margaret Trudeau became close friends with Fidel Castro.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970,” the Globe reports, before explaining the Trudeaus had such a great time on the Caribbean island that “an enduring friendship was forged between the arch-liberal Pierre Trudeau and the Marxist-revolutionary Fidel Castro.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAnd while fact checkers enjoy debunking claims the Trudeaus were in Havana nine months before Justin was born, there are some inconvenient facts the fact checkers refuse to address.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Trudeaus embarked on a Caribbean holiday in that time frame, with reports of visits to various islands in the Caribbean. While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another. Pierre was not amused.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“But what was I to do?

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.\n\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.\n\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.\n\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail confirms that Pierre and Margaret Trudeau became close friends with Fidel Castro.\n\n“Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970,” the Globe reports, before explaining the Trudeaus had such a great time on the Caribbean island that “an enduring friendship was forged between the arch-liberal Pierre Trudeau and the Marxist-revolutionary Fidel Castro.”\n\nAnd while fact checkers enjoy debunking claims the Trudeaus were in Havana nine months before Justin was born, there are some inconvenient facts the fact checkers refuse to address.\n\nThe Trudeaus embarked on a Caribbean holiday in that time frame, with reports of visits to various islands in the Caribbean. While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.\n\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?\n\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.\n\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.\n\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.\n\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.\n\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:\n\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another. Pierre was not amused.”\n\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?\n\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.\n\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.\n\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“\n\n“But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me.”\n\nEarlier this year Newspunch broke the news that Trudeau’s half-brother, Kyle Kemper, admitted that Justin is a “pawn” of the global elite in service of the New World Order. \n\nTrudeau is “not speaking from his heart,” said his half-brother, who added “blackmail is a very powerful tool.”\n\nAsked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.\n\nWas Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order? His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLl9RSVdlaFZsNzRz</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 10, 2022 9:34 am</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlZ1Y1pZcXdMVGpj\" data-date=\"1660000250\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-video-title=\"The Global Elites Are Normalizing Pedophilia\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VucZYqwLTjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Governments across the world, operating under the control of the World Economic Forum, are waging war on our children.

Very,” before walking off camera.\n\nHis bizarre video was quickly topped a few seconds later when Geller posted an even more outrageous letter to Putin, threatening to use “every last molecule of my mind power to prevent you from launching a nuclear attack”.\n\nGeller then asked readers to take ‘”five seconds out of your day to visualise a radiant, energetic force field…like a dazzling, golden shield in the sky” that he claimed would deflect any nuclear warheads deployed by the Kremlin, turning them back to destroy Russia.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmRDTnlIbTJ6WTlN</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 5, 2022 10:25 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ\" data-date=\"1659648584\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-video-title=\"UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7URELIJsblY/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The United Nations has declared war on conspiracy theories, describing the rise of conspiracy thinking as “worrying and dangerous”, and providing the public with a toolkit to “prebunk” and “debunk” anybody who dares to suggest that world governments are anything but completely honest, upstanding and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN also warns that George Soros, the Rothschilds and the State of Israel must not be linked to any “alleged conspiracies.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO has teamed up with Twitter, the European Commission and the World Jewish Congress to launch the campaign dubbed #ThinkBeforeSharing: Stop the spread of conspiracy theories.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN wants you to know that events are NOT “secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent” and if you encounter anybody who thinks the global elite are conspiring to consolidate power and dictate global events, you must take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to UNESCO, “if you are certain you have encountered a conspiracy theory” on the internet then you must post a relevant link to a “fact-checking website” in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Never mind the fact that “fact checkers” are mostly untrained and unqualified hacks performing “fact checks” from their bedroom in between posting far-left political content and getting high.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO also provide advice for anyone who encounters a real live conspiracy theorist in the flesh.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.
