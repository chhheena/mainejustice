Scientists were discovering that many pharmaceutical drugs could be made from oil.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRockefeller immediately seized on the opportunity to monopolize the oil, chemical and medical industries all at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe best thing about petrochemicals was that everything could be patented and sold for high profits.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut there was one problem with Rockefeller’s tyrannical plan for the medical industry: natural &amp; herbal medicines were very popular in America at that time. Almost half the doctors and medical colleges in the U.S. were practicing holistic medicine, using knowledge from Europe and Native Americans to heal patients.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRockefeller, the monopolist, had to figure out a way to get rid of his biggest competition.

From the prestigious Carnegie Foundation, they sent a man named Abraham Flexner to travel around the country and report on the status of medical colleges and hospitals around the country.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis led to the Flexner Report, which gave birth to the modern medicine as we know it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe report talked about the need for revamping and centralizing our medical institutions. Based on this report, more than half of all medical colleges were shut down. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHomeopathy and natural medicines were demonized by the media and government; and doctors who dared to practice holistic medicine were jailed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo coerce any remaining doctors and scientists who were sitting on the fence, Rockefeller gave over $100 million dollars to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic front group called “General Education Board”. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWithin a short space of time, medical colleges were all homogenized.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.\n\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.\n\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.\n\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s.

While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.\n\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?\n\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.\n\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.\n\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.\n\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.\n\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:\n\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another.

But the elite are not allowing us to enjoy the benefits of his real legacy. The elite were threatened by Tesla and his vision of a positive future for humanity.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n73 years after the FBI seized nearly TWO TRUCKS of papers of one of the world’s most famous inventors, the Federal Bureau of Investigations released the documents to the public. The batch of documents made available through the Freedom of Information Act also reveal Tesla did not die on January 7, 1943, as previously believed, but a day later on January 8.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn general, the FBI documents revealed a number of details that changed a lot of what we know about Tesla, his life, his inventions and his legacy. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this video, we take a look at seven ‘lost’ inventions by Tesla, which many people are unaware of.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n1. Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology\n\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.\n\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.\n\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.\n\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.\n\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray\n\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.\n\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.\n\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”\n\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity\n\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.\n\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.\n\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.\n\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.\n\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?\n\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.\n\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

More recently, analysts have alleged that the Chinese government is sterilizing women in Xinjiang, a province with a large population of Uighur Muslims.\n\nIt doesn’t take a massive leap of the imagination to see how the aims of South Africa’s anti-fertility vaccine project would have benefited from research into self-spreading vaccines. These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

Based on this report, more than half of all medical colleges were shut down. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHomeopathy and natural medicines were demonized by the media and government; and doctors who dared to practice holistic medicine were jailed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo coerce any remaining doctors and scientists who were sitting on the fence, Rockefeller gave over $100 million dollars to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic front group called “General Education Board”. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWithin a short space of time, medical colleges were all homogenized.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail confirms that Pierre and Margaret Trudeau became close friends with Fidel Castro.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970,” the Globe reports, before explaining the Trudeaus had such a great time on the Caribbean island that “an enduring friendship was forged between the arch-liberal Pierre Trudeau and the Marxist-revolutionary Fidel Castro.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAnd while fact checkers enjoy debunking claims the Trudeaus were in Havana nine months before Justin was born, there are some inconvenient facts the fact checkers refuse to address.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Trudeaus embarked on a Caribbean holiday in that time frame, with reports of visits to various islands in the Caribbean. While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another. Pierre was not amused.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEarlier this year Newspunch broke the news that Trudeau’s half-brother, Kyle Kemper, admitted that Justin is a “pawn” of the global elite in service of the New World Order. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTrudeau is “not speaking from his heart,” said his half-brother, who added “blackmail is a very powerful tool.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAsked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWas Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order?

But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.\n\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.\n\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail confirms that Pierre and Margaret Trudeau became close friends with Fidel Castro.\n\n“Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970,” the Globe reports, before explaining the Trudeaus had such a great time on the Caribbean island that “an enduring friendship was forged between the arch-liberal Pierre Trudeau and the Marxist-revolutionary Fidel Castro.”\n\nAnd while fact checkers enjoy debunking claims the Trudeaus were in Havana nine months before Justin was born, there are some inconvenient facts the fact checkers refuse to address.\n\nThe Trudeaus embarked on a Caribbean holiday in that time frame, with reports of visits to various islands in the Caribbean. While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.\n\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?\n\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.\n\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.\n\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.\n\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.\n\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:\n\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another. Pierre was not amused.”\n\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?\n\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.\n\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.\n\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“\n\n“But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me.”\n\nEarlier this year Newspunch broke the news that Trudeau’s half-brother, Kyle Kemper, admitted that Justin is a “pawn” of the global elite in service of the New World Order. \n\nTrudeau is “not speaking from his heart,” said his half-brother, who added “blackmail is a very powerful tool.”\n\nAsked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.\n\nWas Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order? His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLl9RSVdlaFZsNzRz</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 10, 2022 9:34 am</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlZ1Y1pZcXdMVGpj\" data-date=\"1660000250\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-video-title=\"The Global Elites Are Normalizing Pedophilia\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VucZYqwLTjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Governments across the world, operating under the control of the World Economic Forum, are waging war on our children.

Very,” before walking off camera.\n\nHis bizarre video was quickly topped a few seconds later when Geller posted an even more outrageous letter to Putin, threatening to use “every last molecule of my mind power to prevent you from launching a nuclear attack”.\n\nGeller then asked readers to take ‘”five seconds out of your day to visualise a radiant, energetic force field…like a dazzling, golden shield in the sky” that he claimed would deflect any nuclear warheads deployed by the Kremlin, turning them back to destroy Russia.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmRDTnlIbTJ6WTlN</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 5, 2022 10:25 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ\" data-date=\"1659648584\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-video-title=\"UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7URELIJsblY/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The United Nations has declared war on conspiracy theories, describing the rise of conspiracy thinking as “worrying and dangerous”, and providing the public with a toolkit to “prebunk” and “debunk” anybody who dares to suggest that world governments are anything but completely honest, upstanding and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN also warns that George Soros, the Rothschilds and the State of Israel must not be linked to any “alleged conspiracies.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO has teamed up with Twitter, the European Commission and the World Jewish Congress to launch the campaign dubbed #ThinkBeforeSharing: Stop the spread of conspiracy theories.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN wants you to know that events are NOT “secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent” and if you encounter anybody who thinks the global elite are conspiring to consolidate power and dictate global events, you must take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to UNESCO, “if you are certain you have encountered a conspiracy theory” on the internet then you must post a relevant link to a “fact-checking website” in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Never mind the fact that “fact checkers” are mostly untrained and unqualified hacks performing “fact checks” from their bedroom in between posting far-left political content and getting high.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO also provide advice for anyone who encounters a real live conspiracy theorist in the flesh.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro. That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail confirms that Pierre and Margaret Trudeau became close friends with Fidel Castro.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970,” the Globe reports, before explaining the Trudeaus had such a great time on the Caribbean island that “an enduring friendship was forged between the arch-liberal Pierre Trudeau and the Marxist-revolutionary Fidel Castro.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAnd while fact checkers enjoy debunking claims the Trudeaus were in Havana nine months before Justin was born, there are some inconvenient facts the fact checkers refuse to address.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Trudeaus embarked on a Caribbean holiday in that time frame, with reports of visits to various islands in the Caribbean. While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another. Pierre was not amused.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEarlier this year Newspunch broke the news that Trudeau’s half-brother, Kyle Kemper, admitted that Justin is a “pawn” of the global elite in service of the New World Order. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTrudeau is “not speaking from his heart,” said his half-brother, who added “blackmail is a very powerful tool.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAsked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWas Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order?

That’s old Pierre Trudeau on the right, pretending not to have a problem with his young and attractive wife hanging off the arm of Cuba’s swashbuckling dictator.\n\nDon’t forget, Castro was a hero figure for the international Left in the 1970s. Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail confirms that Pierre and Margaret Trudeau became close friends with Fidel Castro.\n\n“Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970,” the Globe reports, before explaining the Trudeaus had such a great time on the Caribbean island that “an enduring friendship was forged between the arch-liberal Pierre Trudeau and the Marxist-revolutionary Fidel Castro.”\n\nAnd while fact checkers enjoy debunking claims the Trudeaus were in Havana nine months before Justin was born, there are some inconvenient facts the fact checkers refuse to address.\n\nThe Trudeaus embarked on a Caribbean holiday in that time frame, with reports of visits to various islands in the Caribbean. While Cuba does not appear on an official itinerary, it is inconceivable that they would visit neighboring islands and choose not to visit their good friend in Havana while they were in the neighborhood.\n\nSo what really happened in Havana in 1970 nine months before Justin Trudeau was born back home in Ottowa?\n\nTucker Carlson introduced his viewers to the conspiracy earlier this year, declaring that Trudeau is “for sure” the lovechild of former Cuban president Fidel Castro while educating his viewers about the long and sexually charged “friendship” the Cuban dictator enjoyed with Trudeau’s mother Margaret Trudeau.\n\nBear in mind this trip to Cuba took place one year before Justin, who does not resemble his father Pierre at all, was born.\n\nWhile there is no official record, there is a record of Margaret visiting Cuba after the birth of her son Justin where she was greeted on the tarmac by Fidel.\n\nBefore shocking Canada by marrying the sitting Prime Minister of Canada, Margaret was famous in the 1970s for risqué behavior.\n\nDescribing a 1974 affair with Ted Kennedy, Margaret Trudeau wrote in her memoir about the moment she met the US Senator at a state dinner in New York:\n\n“That evening, I felt such a pull toward him that we couldn’t even stand within a couple metres of one another. Pierre was not amused.”\n\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?\n\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.\n\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.\n\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“\n\n“But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me.”\n\nEarlier this year Newspunch broke the news that Trudeau’s half-brother, Kyle Kemper, admitted that Justin is a “pawn” of the global elite in service of the New World Order. \n\nTrudeau is “not speaking from his heart,” said his half-brother, who added “blackmail is a very powerful tool.”\n\nAsked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.\n\nWas Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order? His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLl9RSVdlaFZsNzRz</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 10, 2022 9:34 am</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlZ1Y1pZcXdMVGpj\" data-date=\"1660000250\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-video-title=\"The Global Elites Are Normalizing Pedophilia\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VucZYqwLTjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Governments across the world, operating under the control of the World Economic Forum, are waging war on our children.

Very,” before walking off camera.\n\nHis bizarre video was quickly topped a few seconds later when Geller posted an even more outrageous letter to Putin, threatening to use “every last molecule of my mind power to prevent you from launching a nuclear attack”.\n\nGeller then asked readers to take ‘”five seconds out of your day to visualise a radiant, energetic force field…like a dazzling, golden shield in the sky” that he claimed would deflect any nuclear warheads deployed by the Kremlin, turning them back to destroy Russia.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmRDTnlIbTJ6WTlN</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 5, 2022 10:25 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ\" data-date=\"1659648584\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-video-title=\"UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7URELIJsblY/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The United Nations has declared war on conspiracy theories, describing the rise of conspiracy thinking as “worrying and dangerous”, and providing the public with a toolkit to “prebunk” and “debunk” anybody who dares to suggest that world governments are anything but completely honest, upstanding and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN also warns that George Soros, the Rothschilds and the State of Israel must not be linked to any “alleged conspiracies.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO has teamed up with Twitter, the European Commission and the World Jewish Congress to launch the campaign dubbed #ThinkBeforeSharing: Stop the spread of conspiracy theories.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN wants you to know that events are NOT “secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent” and if you encounter anybody who thinks the global elite are conspiring to consolidate power and dictate global events, you must take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to UNESCO, “if you are certain you have encountered a conspiracy theory” on the internet then you must post a relevant link to a “fact-checking website” in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Never mind the fact that “fact checkers” are mostly untrained and unqualified hacks performing “fact checks” from their bedroom in between posting far-left political content and getting high.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO also provide advice for anyone who encounters a real live conspiracy theorist in the flesh.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

Pierre was not amused.”\n\nWas Pierre having flashbacks to what happened in Havana a few years before?\n\nJustin Trudeau’s parentage has not been seriously questioned by the mainstream in Canada, however startling new information that has come to light in Cuba may change that.\n\nA handwritten suicide note left by Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, 68, the eldest of Fidel Castro’s legitimate children, appears to confirm the longstanding rumor in Cuba that Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau’s father.\n\nFidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “always comparing me unfavorably with Justin” and “dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.“\n\n“But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me.”\n\nEarlier this year Newspunch broke the news that Trudeau’s half-brother, Kyle Kemper, admitted that Justin is a “pawn” of the global elite in service of the New World Order. \n\nTrudeau is “not speaking from his heart,” said his half-brother, who added “blackmail is a very powerful tool.”\n\nAsked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.\n\nWas Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order? His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLl9RSVdlaFZsNzRz</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 10, 2022 9:34 am</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlZ1Y1pZcXdMVGpj\" data-date=\"1660000250\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-video-title=\"The Global Elites Are Normalizing Pedophilia\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VucZYqwLTjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Governments across the world, operating under the control of the World Economic Forum, are waging war on our children.

Very,” before walking off camera.\n\nHis bizarre video was quickly topped a few seconds later when Geller posted an even more outrageous letter to Putin, threatening to use “every last molecule of my mind power to prevent you from launching a nuclear attack”.\n\nGeller then asked readers to take ‘”five seconds out of your day to visualise a radiant, energetic force field…like a dazzling, golden shield in the sky” that he claimed would deflect any nuclear warheads deployed by the Kremlin, turning them back to destroy Russia.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmRDTnlIbTJ6WTlN</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 5, 2022 10:25 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ\" data-date=\"1659648584\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-video-title=\"UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7URELIJsblY/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The United Nations has declared war on conspiracy theories, describing the rise of conspiracy thinking as “worrying and dangerous”, and providing the public with a toolkit to “prebunk” and “debunk” anybody who dares to suggest that world governments are anything but completely honest, upstanding and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN also warns that George Soros, the Rothschilds and the State of Israel must not be linked to any “alleged conspiracies.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO has teamed up with Twitter, the European Commission and the World Jewish Congress to launch the campaign dubbed #ThinkBeforeSharing: Stop the spread of conspiracy theories.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN wants you to know that events are NOT “secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent” and if you encounter anybody who thinks the global elite are conspiring to consolidate power and dictate global events, you must take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to UNESCO, “if you are certain you have encountered a conspiracy theory” on the internet then you must post a relevant link to a “fact-checking website” in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Never mind the fact that “fact checkers” are mostly untrained and unqualified hacks performing “fact checks” from their bedroom in between posting far-left political content and getting high.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO also provide advice for anyone who encounters a real live conspiracy theorist in the flesh.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

The report said that&nbsp;total healthcare spending would increase by more than $50 billion over a period of 20 years under the drug pricing proposals in the legislation.</p> <p>Similarly, the inflation crisis Americans face under the Biden presidency may hit <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/11/biden-inflation-medical-care-cost-healthcare-drug-prices/\">healthcare</a> costs the hardest, the Daily Caller&rsquo;s Dylan Housman reports. This is a problem for Democrats, since their best hope for using healthcare to boost their midterm chances is in lowering prices, especially given the bleak economy inflation has gifted Americans. Current prices don&rsquo;t reflect skyrocketing inflation, which will hit American pocketbooks much later.</p> <p>Democrats&rsquo; best chance to make healthcare a deciding issue for midterm voters is in proving that their policies will reduce prices. Such a strategy would couple Democrats&rsquo; healthcare legislation with Americans&rsquo; understandable concern about the economy, and show midterm voters that left-wing healthcare policies can help ease the toll which the economy under Biden has taken. Proving this will be an uphill battle.</p> </div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"rcjs_load_x9cns\" data-rc-widget data-endpoint=\"trends.revcontent.com\" data-widget-id=\"270978\" data-rev-more
