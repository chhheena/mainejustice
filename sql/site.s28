Mit dem Beispiel der weltweiten Corona-Krise, der „schlimmsten Krise der modernen Geschichte“ (3), rückt nun auch die Wissenschaft ins Blickfeld der kritischen Öffentlichkeit. <strong>Prof. Dr. med. John Ioannidis</strong> (USA) spricht angesichts der Corona-Politik von einem Schlag gegen die öffentliche Gesundheit und ihre Glaubwürdigkeit. Fazit: Habe den Mut, dich deines eigenen Verstandes zu bedienen – und gehorche nicht!</p>\n<h2><strong>Planet Lockdown: Dokumentation eines globalen Verbrechens</strong></h2>\n<p>Der Blog „Krisenfrei“, der den Film „Planet-Lockdown“ von „Kla.TV“ übernommen hat, bringt zunächst eine kurze Zusammenfassung: „Source News ist eine Online-Journalismusplattform mit Sitz in Schottland. Ihr Film ‚Planet-Lockdown‘ ist eine Dokumentation – so Source News – über das Leben und was mit unserer Welt durch die Covid19-Agenda geschah. Der Film umfasst Zeitzeugenberichte aus aller Welt und stellt eine Gegenstimme zur öffentlichen Berichterstattung und Geschichtsschreibung durch Politik und Leitmedien dar. Es ist aber auch ein ‚forensisches Gutachten‘ für spätere gerichtliche Aufarbeitungen. Denn die ganze Covid19-Agenda ist ein perfide geplantes und global eingefädeltes Verbrechen an der Menschheit. Da sich nach einer kurzen Lockerung der Coronamaßnahmen bereits jetzt abzeichnet, dass von denselben Strippenziehern ein verheerender Zustand der Dauerpandemien verhängt werden soll, gewinnt die Dokumentation ‚Planet Lockdown‘ an besonderer Bedeutung als Orientierungshilfe.“ (4)</p>\n<p>Anschließend publiziert „Kla.TV“ den <a href=\"https://krisenfrei.com/planetlockdown-dokumentation-eines-globalen-verbrechens/\">Videotext der Dokumentation</a> „Planet-Lockdown“. „Krisenfrei“ empfiehlt allen Lesern, sich die Doku anzuschauen und sie weiter zu verteilen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Statements von Persönlichkeiten aus dem Film</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Bischof Schneider</strong> (Kasachstan):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">„Es war eine orchestrierte und konzertierte Aktion, die überall auf der Welt gleich ablief.“</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Michael Yeadon</strong> (Former Chief Scientific Officer and Vice President, Pfizer):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Wenn man bedenkt, dass dieses Virus gegenüber der Influenza schlimmstenfalls ein leicht erhöhtes Risiko für Ältere gegenüber der Influenza und ein geringeres Risiko für jeden darstellt, der jung und körperlich fit ist, war es nie wirklich notwendig, dass wir besondere Anstrengungen unternehmen (…): Lockdowns, Masken, Massentestungen, sogar Impfungen.“</p>\n<p><strong>Vera Sharav</strong> (Holocaust-Überlebende):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">„Diese Länder haben COVID als Gelegenheit genutzt, eine Form der Euthanasie an Alten und Behinderten durchzuführen, sich also der wirtschaftlichen Last zu entledigen, sowie die letzten Zeitzeugen der Geschichte auszurotten.“</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Sucharit Bakdi</strong> (Ph. D. Professor and Mikrobiologist, most cited Biologist):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Mich und meine Frau hat dies zutiefst desillusioniert, und wir machen uns Sorgen, dass die Öffentlichkeit, die Menschen um uns nicht begreifen, dass sie in den Untergang geführt werden, dass sie ihre Menschlichkeit endgültig preisgeben, da sie keine Menschenrechte mehr haben.“</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Dr. Michael Yeadon:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">„An alle Ärzte, die schweigen und an alle, die aktiv an der Verabreichung der Impfstoffe, vor allem bei jungen, gesunden Menschen tätig sind: Meines Erachtens seid ihr dafür verantwortlich, den Nürnberger Kodex zu brechen. Und meine Beteiligung an eurer Anklage wird mir eine Freude sein.“</p>\n<p><strong>Klaus Schwab</strong> (Gründer des Weltwirtschaftsforums WEF, Davos):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">„Die Menschen gehen also davon aus, dass wir einfach in die gute, alte Weltordnung, die wir hatten, zurückkehren. Das ist, sagen wir es mal so, eine Fiktion. Das wird nicht passieren.“ (5)</p>\n<h2><strong>Prof. Ioannidis: „Schlag gegen die öffentliche Gesundheit und ihre Glaubwürdigkeit“</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr. John Ioannidis, Professor der Medizin der Stanford Universität in Kalifornien (USA) geht nach einem neueren Artikel der Internet-Plattform „unzensuriert“ mit der Corona-Politik hart ins Gericht (6). Da er in Corona-Zeiten nicht dem von der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO und den westlichen Regierungen Gewünschten gefolgt ist, gilt der ehemalige wissenschaftliche Guru heute quasi als „Schwurbler“. Er kritisierte stets die fehlende wissenschaftliche Basis der Corona-Maßnahmen, riet zur Mäßigung und warnte vor Panikmache.</p>\n<p>In einem Interview Ende Juli sagte Prof. Ioannidis:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">„Das Argument, dass Impfstoffe Epidemiewellen brechen können, war ein Kernstück des Strebens nach aggressiven Mandaten. Das wäre zuvor undenkbar gewesen. Dies führte zu einem (…) Schlag gegen die öffentliche Gesundheit und ihre Glaubwürdigkeit.“ (7)</p>\n<p>Seines Erachtens haben die überzogenen Maßnahmen zur „Störung des sozialen Zusammenhalts und der Marginalisierung vieler schutzbedürftiger Menschen“ geführt. Weiter schreibt „unzenuriert“:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">„Und als langfristige Folge stellt der Wissenschaftler fest, dass die Angstmacherei zwar die Akzeptanz der Corona-Radikalmaßnahmen geringfügig erhöht, aber dem Bemühen um die öffentliche Gesundheit einen Bärendienst erwiesen hätte. Denn ist das Vertrauen einmal weg, so lässt es sich nicht mehr so leicht wieder herstellen.“ (8)</p>\n<h2><strong>Habe den Mut, dich deines eigenen Verstandes zu bedienen! </strong></h2>\n<p>Die weltweite Ausnahmesituation und die zu erwartenden Dauer-Pandemien sowie immer neu begründete Lockdowns (wie zum Beispiel Klima-Lockdowns), die bei den Menschen große Ängste und Panik auslösen, erfordern es, weise zu sein, zwischen Wahrheit und Lüge zu unterscheiden und danach zu handeln. Das ist für uns Bürger aufgrund unserer „guten“ Erziehung zum Gehorsam nicht leicht.</p>\n<p>Nicht nur die schwer arbeitende Bevölkerung, die weder Zeit, noch Muse und Gelegenheit hat, sich umfassend zu informieren, versagt im Widerstand gegen den aufkommenden Totalitarismus und Faschismus und die damit einhergehenden Versuche der Manipulation und Täuschung der Bürger. Auch die akademischen Kreise und Intellektuellen, deren Pflicht es wäre, für die anderen Menschen mitzudenken und mit der Freiheit des Denkens die Freiheit überhaupt zu proklamieren, werden ihrer Verantwortung nicht gerecht.</p>\n<p>Gründe für die Unmündigkeit, selbst zu denken, sind nach Kant Faulheit und Feigheit. Unmündig zu sein, sei bequem und eigenständiges Denken ein „verdrießliches Geschäft“. So werde es für andere leicht, meint Kant, sich zu „Vormündern“, dieser unmündigen Menschen aufzuschwingen. Diese Vormünder würden auch alles dafür tun, dass die unmündigen Menschen den Schritt zur Mündigkeit nicht nur für beschwerlich, sondern auch noch für gefährlich halten.</p>\n<p>Psychologisch gesehen ist es für einen verwöhnten und denkfaulen Menschen „bequemer“, sich der Anleitung einer Autorität oder eines Führers zu bedienen Damit befindet er sich im Einklang mit einem vermeintlich Mächtigen und seinen Massenmedien und gehört dem Kreis seiner Hofschranzen an. Er befindet sich somit stets auf der „richtigen“ Seite.  Zweifel und moralische Bedenken bedrücken ihn nicht, da er sich immer auf die vermeintlich unfehlbare „Macht“ berufen kann.</p>\n<p>Es ist mühsam, selbst zu denken und für die Folgen mündigen Verhaltens verantwortlich zu sein. Zweifel überfallen den nach Wahrheit Suchenden; der nächtliche Schlaf wird unruhig. Kommt ein Selbst-Denkender auch noch zu unliebsamen Wahrheiten, die im Widerspruch zu den Mächtigen und zur politischen Korrektheit stehen, wenden sich ehemalige Weggefährten von ihm ab und der bisherige Arbeitsplatz ist in Gefahr. Das Resultat dieses Mutes kann Einsamkeit sein. Einsamkeit nicht im Sinne des Alleinseins, sondern im Sinne der Verweigerung des Dialogs.</p>\n<p>Auch der Ehrenkodex, das ungeschriebene Regelwerk über das Wohlverhalten von Berufsgruppen, das mit entsprechenden Verpflichtungen und Privilegien verbunden ist, scheint bei akademischen und anderen herausragenden Berufsgruppen nicht mehr zu gelten. Die Menschen weltweit werden durch diesen Verrat der eigenen Berufsethik in einen Zustand der Not, Armut und Hoffnungslosigkeit, von Vereinsamung und Ausgestoßenheit getrieben.</p>\n<p>Wie können Ärzte oder ärztliche Politikberater Verordnungen treffen, die nicht zu „Nutz und Frommen der Kranken“ sind und die sie nicht bewahren vor Schaden und willkürlichem Unrecht. Dabei ist der Beruf des Arztes nur ein Beispiel für die vielen anderen Berufsgruppen. Wirklich angeklagt werden müssten jedoch die diabolischen „Strippenzieher“ und die ihnen zu Diensten stehenden korrupten Politiker, die den anerzogenen Gehorsam der Bürgerinnen und Bürger auf schändliche Weise missbrauchen (9).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

With the example of the worldwide Corona crisis, the &#8220;worst crisis in modern history&#8221; (3), science is now also moving into the field of vision of the critical public. <strong>Prof. Dr. med. John Ioannidis</strong> (USA) speaks of a blow to public health and its credibility in view of the Corona policy. Conclusion: Have the courage to use your own mind – and don&#8217;t obey!</p>\n<h2><strong>Planet Lockdown: Documentation of a global crime</strong></h2>\n<p>The blog &#8220;Krisenfrei&#8221;, which has taken over the film &#8220;Planet Lockdown&#8221; from &#8220;Kla.TV&#8221;, first brings a short summary: &#8220;Source News is an online journalism platform based in Scotland. Their film &#8216;Planet-Lockdown&#8217; is a documentary &#8211; according to Source News &#8211; about life and what happened to our world through the Covid19 agenda. The film includes eyewitness accounts from around the world and is a counter-voice to public reporting and historiography by politicians and the leading media. But it is also a &#8216;forensic report&#8217; for later judicial reappraisals. For the whole Covid19 agenda is a perfidiously planned and globally orchestrated crime against humanity. With a brief easing of the Corona measures already showing that a devastating state of permanent pandemics is to be imposed by the same string-pullers, the documentary &#8216;Planet Lockdown&#8217; takes on particular importance as a guide.&#8221; (4)</p>\n<p>Subsequently, &#8220;Kla.TV&#8221; <a href=\"https://krisenfrei.com/planetlockdown-dokumentation-eines-globalen-verbrechens/\">publishes the teletext </a>of the documentary &#8220;Planet Lockdown&#8221;. &#8220;Krisenfrei&#8221; recommends all readers to watch the documentary and to distribute it further.</p>\n<h2><strong>Statements by personalities from the film</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Bishop Schneider</strong> (Kazakhstan):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;It was an orchestrated and concerted action that happened the same way all over the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Michael Yeadon</strong> (Former Chief Scientific Officer and Vice President, Pfizer):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Considering that this virus poses at worst a slightly increased risk to the elderly over influenza and a lower risk to anyone who is young and physically fit, it was never really necessary for us to make any special efforts (&#8230;). Lockdowns, masks, mass testing, even vaccination.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Vera Sharav</strong> (Holocaust survivor):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;These countries used COVID as an opportunity to carry out a form of euthanasia on the elderly and disabled, in other words to get rid of the economic burden, as well as to exterminate the last witnesses of history.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Sucharit Bakdi</strong> (Ph. D. Professor and Microbiologist, most cited Biologist):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Me and my wife have been deeply disillusioned by this and we are worried that the public, the people around us don&#8217;t realise that they are being led to ruin, that they are finally giving away their humanity because they no longer have human rights.&#8221;</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Dr Michael Yeadon</strong>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;To all the doctors who are silent and to all those who are actively involved in administering the vaccines, especially to young, healthy people: In my view, you are responsible for breaking the Nuremberg Code. And my participation in your prosecution will be a pleasure.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Klaus Schwab</strong> (founder of the World Economic Forum WEF, Davos):</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;So people assume that we are just going back to the good old world order that we had. That is, let&#8217;s put it this way, a fiction. That&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221; (5)</p>\n<h2><strong>Prof. Ioannidis: &#8220;Blow to public health and its credibility&#8221;</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr. John Ioannidis, professor of medicine at Stanford University in California (USA) is taking the Corona policy to task, according to a recent article on the internet platform &#8220;uncensored&#8221; (6). Since he did not follow what the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Western governments wanted in Corona times, the former scientific guru is now considered a &#8220;swindler&#8221;, so to speak. He always criticised the lack of scientific basis of the Corona measures, advised moderation and warned against scaremongering.</p>\n<p>In an interview at the end of July, Prof. Ioannidis said:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;The argument that vaccines can break epidemic waves was a centrepiece of the drive for aggressive mandates. This would have been unthinkable before. This led to a (&#8230;) blow to public health and its credibility.&#8221; (7)</p>\n<p>In his view, the excessive measures have led to the &#8220;disruption of social cohesion and the marginalisation of many vulnerable people&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Further, &#8220;uncensored&#8221; writes:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;And as a long-term consequence, the researcher notes that while fear-mongering may have marginally increased the acceptance of the Corona radical measures, it would have done a disservice to the public health effort. For once confidence is gone, it is not so easily restored.&#8221; (8)</p>\n<h2><strong>Have the courage to use your own mind! </strong></h2>\n<p>The worldwide exceptional situation and the expected permanent pandemics, as well as lockdowns that are always newly justified (such as climate lockdowns), which cause great fear and panic among people, require us to be wise, to distinguish between truth and lies and to act accordingly. This is not easy for us citizens because of our &#8220;good&#8221; upbringing of obedience.</p>\n<p>It is not only the hard-working population, which has neither the time, nor the muse, nor the opportunity to inform itself comprehensively, that fails to resist the rising totalitarianism and fascism and the accompanying attempts to manipulate and deceive the citizens. The academic circles and intellectuals, whose duty it would be to think for other people and to proclaim freedom in general with the freedom of thought, are also failing to live up to their responsibility.</p>\n<p>According to Kant, the reasons for not being able to think for oneself are laziness and cowardice.  It is comfortable to be immature and independent thinking is a &#8220;vexatious business&#8221;. This makes it easy for others, says Kant, to become &#8220;guardians&#8221; of these immature people. These guardians would also do everything to ensure that the immature people would not only consider the step towards maturity to be arduous, but also dangerous.</p>\n<p>Psychologically, it is more &#8220;comfortable&#8221; for a spoiled and thoughtless person to follow the guidance of an authority or a leader. In this way, he is in harmony with a supposedly powerful person and his mass media and belongs to the circle of his courtiers. He is thus always on the &#8220;right&#8221; side.  Doubts and moral misgivings do not oppress him, since he can always refer to the supposedly infallible &#8220;power&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It is tedious to think for oneself and to be responsible for the consequences of mature behaviour. Doubts assail the seeker of truth; the nightly sleep becomes restless. If a self-thinker also comes to disagreeable truths that contradict the powerful and political correctness, former companions turn away from him and the previous job is in danger. The result of this courage can be loneliness. Loneliness not in the sense of being alone, but in the sense of refusing dialogue.</p>\n<p>Even the code of honour, the unwritten set of rules about the good conduct of professional groups, which comes with corresponding obligations and privileges, no longer seems to apply to academic and other prominent professional groups. People worldwide are being driven into a state of destitution, poverty and hopelessness, of isolation and outcastness by this betrayal of their own professional ethics. How can doctors or medical policy advisors make decrees that are not for the &#8220;benefit and piety of the sick&#8221; and that do not protect them from harm and arbitrary injustice.</p>\n<p>The medical profession is only one example of the many other professions. What should really be accused, however, are the diabolical &#8220;string-pullers&#8221; and the corrupt politicians at their service who shamefully abuse the citizens&#8217; instilled obedience (9).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The Pharma giant Pfizer has now announced what they claim were spectacular results in initial human tests. They use an experimental technology known as gene editing, specifically mRNA gene-editing, something never before used in vaccines. Before we rush to get jabbed in hopes of some immunity, we should know more about the radical experimental technology and its lack of precision.</span></em></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5726478 alignright\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"181\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus.jpg 1000w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fauci-Mask-Hearing-Coronavirus-400x225.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\"></a>The financial world went ballistic on November 9 when the pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner, <strong>BioNTech, announced in a company press release that it had developed a vaccine for Covid19 that was “90%” effective.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"> The controversial US head of NIAID, <strong>Tony Fauci</strong> (right<strong>) </strong>rushed to greet the news and the EU announced it had purchased 300 million doses of the costly new vaccine. If you believe financial markets, the pandemic is all but past history.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Suspicious events</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">However it seems <strong>Albert Bourla</strong>, the CEO of Pfizer, doesn’t share the confidence of his own claims. On the day his company issued its press release on the proposed vaccine trials, he sold 62% of his stock in Pfizer, making millions profit in the deal. <strong>He made the sell order in a special option in August so it would not appear as “insider selling”</strong>, however he also timed it just after the US elections and the mainstream media illegitimately declared Joe Biden President-elect. It seems from appearances that Bourla had a pretty clear conflict of interest in the timing of his press release on the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pfizer-ceo-sold-stock-day-covid-19-vaccine-results-unveiled-2020-11-1029790705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same day</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Bourla lied and denied to the Press that his company had received any funds from the Trump Administration to develop the vaccine when it came out they contracted in summer to deliver 100 million doses to the US Government. Further adding to the suspect actions of Pfizer was the fact the company first informed the team of<strong> Joe biden</strong> rather than the relevant US government agencies.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">But this is far from the only thing alarming about the much-hyped Pfizer announcement. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">The German Partner</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Pfizer, famous for its Viagra and other drugs, has partnered with a small Mainz, Germany company, <strong>BioNTech</strong>, which has developed the radical mRNA technique used to produce the new corona vaccine. BioNTech was only founded in 2008. BioNTech signed an agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in September, 2019, just before announcement in Wuhan China of the Novel Coronavirus and just before BioNTech made its stock market debut. The agreement involved cooperation on developing new mRNA techniques to treat cancer and HIV. Curiously that press release, “The Gates Foundation sees BioNTech potential to ‘dramatically reduce global HIV and tuberculosis’” 05. September 2019, has now been deleted.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BioNTech also has an agreement with one of the largest drug producers in China, <strong>Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd</strong> (“Fosun Pharma”) to develop a version of its mRNA vaccine for novel coronavirus for the Chinese market. <strong>Ai-Min Hui,</strong> President of Global R&amp;D of Fosun Pharma said in an August statement, “Dosing the first Chinese subject with BNT162b1 marks a milestone of the global co-development program in China. We are closely working with BioNTech and regulatory authorities to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BNT162b1 and other mRNA <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/05/2073035/0/en/BioNTech-and-Fosun-Pharma-Announce-Start-of-Clinical-Trial-of-mRNA-based-COVID-19-Vaccine-Candidate-in-China.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vaccine candidates</a>…”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">T<strong>his means that the same German biotech company is behind the covid vaccines being rushed out in China as well as the USA and EU.</strong> The vaccine is being rushed through to eventual approval in an alarmingly short time. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Both US and EU authorities and presumably also Chinese, waived the standard animal tests using ferrets or mice and have gone straight to human “guinea pigs.” Human tests began in late July and early August. Three months is unheard of for testing a new vaccine. Several years is the norm. Because of the degree of global panic engendered by WHO over the coronavirus, caution is thrown to the wind. Vaccine makers all have legal indemnity, meaning they can’t be sued if people die or are maimed from the new vaccine. But the most alarming fact about the new Pfizer-BioNTech gene edited vaccine is that the gene edited mRNA for human vaccine application has never before been approved. Notably, two year peer reviewed tests with mice fed genetically modified corn sprayed with Monsanto glyphosate-rich Roundup first showed cancer tumors after nine months as well as liver and other organ damage. Earlier Monsanto company tests ended at three months and <a href=\"https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claimed no harm</a>. </span><span lang=\"en-US\">A similar situation exists with the gene edited mRNA vaccines that are being rushed out after less than 90 days human tests.</span></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><strong>“<span lang=\"en-US\">Explicitly experimental”</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Dr. Michael Yeadon</strong> replied in a recent public social media comment to a colleague in the UK;  “All vaccines against the SARS-COV-2 virus are by definition novel. No candidate vaccine has been… in development for more than a few months.” Yeadon then went on to declare, </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">“If any such vaccine is approved for use under any circumstances that are not EXPLICITLY experimental, I believe that recipients are being misled to a criminal extent. This is because there are precisely zero human volunteers for…whom there could possibly be more than a few months past-dose safety <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1302725167588798467.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">information</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Yeadon is well qualified to make the critique. As he notes in the comment, “I have a degree in Biochemistry &amp; Toxicology &amp; a research based PhD in pharmacology. I have spent 32 years working in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, mostly in new medicines for disorders of lung &amp; skin. I was a VP at Pfizer &amp; CEO…. of a biotech I founded (Ziarco – acquired by Novartis). I’m <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1302725167588798467.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">knowledgeable</a> about new medicine R&amp;D.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">He was formerly with Pfizer at a very senior level. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Human guinea pigs?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is experimental and far from guaranteed safe, despite the fact that Pfizer, the EU and the notorious Dr Tony Fauci seem ready to roll it out even before year end to hundreds of millions of humans. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The experimental technology is based on a rather new gene manipulation known as gene editing. In a major article in the 2018 New York Council on Foreign Relations magazine, </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Foreign Affairs</span><span lang=\"en-US\">, Bill Gates effusively promoted the novel gene editing CRISPR technology as being able to “transform global development.” He noted that his Gates Foundation had been financing gene editing developments for vaccines and other <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-04-10/gene-editing-good?cid=nlc-fa_fatoday-20180601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">applications for a decade</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">But is the technology for breaking and splicing of human genes so absolutely safe that it is worth risking on a novel experimental vaccine never before used on humans? Contrary to what Bill Gates claims, the scientific answer is no, it is not proven so safe. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In a peer reviewed article in the October, 2020 journal </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Trends in Genetics</span><span lang=\"en-US\">, the authors conclude that “the range of possible molecular events resulting from genome editing has been underestimated and the technology remains unpredictable on, and away from, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016895252030247X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target locus</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Dr. Romeo Quijano</strong>, retired professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the College of Medicine, University of the Philippines Manila, noted some of the dangers of the experimental gene editing when applied to human vaccines. Quijano warns of, </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"en-US\">“the danger that the vaccine might actually “enhance” the pathogenicity of the virus, or make it more aggressive possibly due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), as what happened with previous studies on test vaccines in animals. If that should happen in a major human trial the outcome could be disastrous. This serious adverse effect may not even be detected by a clinical trial especially in highly biased clinical trials laden with conflicts of interest involving vaccine companies. Even when a serious adverse event is detected, this is usually swept under the rug.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"> He cites the case of another Gates mRNA vaccine candidate, Moderna, where “three of the 15 human experimental subjects in the high dose group suffered serious and medically significant symptoms. Moderna, however, concluded that the vaccine was “generally safe and well tolerated,” which the corporate-dominated media dutifully reported, covering-up the <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2020/08/21/hazards-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real danger</a>…”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">He notes, </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"en-US\">“Exogenous mRNA is inherently immune-stimulatory, and this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It may provide adjuvant activity and it may inhibit antigen expression and negatively affect the immune response. The paradoxical effects of innate immune sensing on different formats of mRNA vaccines are incompletely understood.” Quijano adds, “A mRNA-based vaccine could also induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity… and may promote blood coagulation and pathological <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2020/08/21/hazards-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thrombus formation</a>.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Quijano writes in the extensively documented article, </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"en-US\">“among other dangers, the virus-vectored vaccines could undergo recombination with naturally occurring viruses and produce hybrid viruses that could have undesirable properties affecting transmission or virulence. The…possible outcomes of recombination are practically impossible to quantify accurately given existing tools and knowledge. The risks, however, are real, as exemplified by the emergence of mutant types of viruses, enhanced pathogenicity and unexpected serious adverse events (including death) following haphazard mass vaccination campaigns and previous failed attempts to develop chimeric vaccines using <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2020/08/21/hazards-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genetic engineering technology</a>.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr..jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-5599627\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr..jpg 590w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr.-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr.-400x266.jpg 400w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr.-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\"></a>Bill Gates, the mRNA vaccine makers including Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and their close allies such as<strong> Dr. Tony Fauci</strong> of the NIAID are clearly playing fast and loose with human lives in their rush to get these experimental vaccines into our bodies. Notably, the same Dr. Fauci and his NIAID owns the patent on a vaccine for dengue fever known as Dengvaxia, marketed by Sanofi-Pasteur and promoted as an “essential” vaccine by Tedros’ WHO since 2016. <strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong> (right) noted that Fauci and NIAID “knew from the clinical trials that there was a problem with paradoxical immune response,” but they gave it to several hundred thousand Filipino kids anyway. It was estimated that as many as 600 vaccinated children died before the government stopped the <a href=\"https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/05/joseph-mercola/the-well-known-hazards-of-coronavirus-vaccines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vaccinations</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Clearly the well-established Precautionary Principle–if in serious doubt, don’t– is being ignored by Fauci, Pfizer/BioNTech and others in rushing to approve the new mRNA vaccine for coronavirus. Messenger RNA technology has yet to produce an approved medicine, let alone a vaccine.</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

And one module contained only narrative summaries of Moderna’s studies, but no actual study results.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“So we are still missing a large number of results, such as full reports that are supporting those narratives,” Latypova told Kennedy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The FDA “obviously did not object” to any of this, she said. “That’s <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-moderna-bypass-covid-vaccine-safety-standards-documents/\">evidence of collusion</a> to me with the manufacturer.”</p>\n<p>Latypova also discussed Moderna’s clinical trials timeline. She said the Investigational New Drug (IND) application meeting is supposed to occur with the FDA when the company initiates human clinical trials.</p>\n<p>Moderna and the FDA had a pre-IND meeting on Feb. 19, 2020, and the IND application was formally opened the next day. The global pandemic was declared on March 11, 2020.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Somehow these visionaries could predict the future with such certainty that they opened a clinical trial for the vaccine, for which a pandemic was announced a month later,” Latypova said.</p>\n<p>There is normally only one IND application for one product. In this case, however, there are two IND applications — one belonging to Moderna, and one belonging to the National Institutes of Health, which <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-dispute-national-institutes-health/\">partnered</a> with Moderna on its COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<p>Latypova also told Kennedy that Moderna did not conduct studies to determine if its mRNA vaccine affected male fertility.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“We have no idea what [the vaccine] does to young men who want to have children in the future,” she said.</p>\n<p>The documents also confirm that Moderna’s trials studied the vaccine’s delivery mechanism, but not its payload, which in this case is the <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccine-spike-protein-travels-from-injection-site-organ-damage/\">spike protein</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“They want you to believe that … you can … have a truck filled with food, or you can have a truck filled with explosives,” Latypova said. “They’re saying it doesn’t matter. Focus on the truck. It’s the same truck, doesn’t matter what’s inside.”</p>\n<p>In the end, Latypova said,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“They’re desperate to vaccinate every single person on the planet because they don’t want you to know what’s going on.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/moderna-clinical-trials-flawed-fda-pharma-executive-alexandra-latypova-rfk-jr-podcast/\">Watch the episode here</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Makes it illegal to force anyone. <a href=\"https://t.co/mFoEXh1PxD\">pic.twitter.com/mFoEXh1PxD</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Dan Whipple (@DanWhipple_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanWhipple_/status/1556120034744733696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 7, 2022</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chaves, who was elected in April 2022, shared that although he himself has been jabbed, and he encourages others to consider “vaccination” as well, his position is “fundamentally that people have freedom of choice.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“But, if you don’t want to, as I said during my campaign: Costa Rica’s people are not cattle that you beat with a piece of wood and force to get vaccinated,” Chaves declared during the press conference.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Costa Rica’s president emphasized that his administration’s position is the same as that of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the majority of the world’s countries, arguing that Costa Rica’s prior vax mandates are therefore “contrary to international standards.”</p>\n<p>Chaves backed up his claim by highlighting a WHO statement from April 2021, which stated that “vaccine” mandates “interfere with freedom and individual autonomy” and that “One must balance the well-being of the community with individual liberties.”</p>\n<p>He further slammed the mandates as a violation of Costa Rican law since, as he pointed out, the members of Costa Rica’s National Vaccination and Epidemiology Commission (CNVE) were functioning under expired terms when they issued the jab mandates, rendering all of their post-term actions “invalid.”</p>\n<p>After Chaves and his administration took office, “we realized that their terms … officially ended in 2020,” he said.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“When told this, they all got quiet. They said that nobody had told them their terms had ended. And nobody questioned this until the Minister here investigated,” continued Chaves, referring to <strong>Minister of Health Jocelyn Chacón</strong>, also present at the press conference.</p>\n<p>The president explained that he asked Chacón to suspend the jab mandates “given the illegal actions taken by the Commission,” while keeping the shots available for those who, in the exercise of their liberty, desire to be vaccinated.”</p>\n<p>During the press conference, Chacón denied claims that the current government of Costa Rica is “anti-vaccination,” pointing out that its members were “up to date” with their shots.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“There are countries which do not mandate, and have higher rates of vaccination. Why? Because people do not want to be ordered: they prefer to have things explained,” Chacón said.</p>\n<p>In October 2021, Costa Rica <a href=\"https://www.larepublica.net/noticia/certificado-de-vacunacion-contra-la-covid-19-sera-obligatorio-para-ingresar-a-diferentes-actividades-dice-carlos-alvarado\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a> it would start implementing a COVID shot mandate that would require the jab to enter non-essential businesses, including restaurants, shopping malls, gyms, and hotels. The jab was also required for all public servants, and private businesses were permitted to mandate the shot for their employees as well.</p>\n<p>Costa Rica then <a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/costa-rica-becomes-first-country-in-the-world-to-mandate-covid-jabs-to-children/\">became</a> the first country in the world, in November 2021, to mandate COVID jabs for children. The decision came only a week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/breaking-fda-approves-pfizers-covid-19-vaccines-for-children-as-young-as-five/\">gave</a> its approval to administering Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children age 5-11 despite limited safety data and virtually nonexistent need. The Costa Rican government cited the FDA approval in its announcement of the mandate.</p>\n<p>Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-rica-roll-out-fourth-covid-shot-some-2022-05-02/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> that as of May 2022, more than 85% of Costa Ricans had “received at least one shot, while 79% have had two doses, and 41% have received a third vaccine, according to official data.”</p>\n<p>Former Costa Rican president<strong> Carlos Alvarado</strong> announced that month, during his last speech as president, that the country was one of a “select group of countries in the world that has more than 85% of its population vaccinated with at least one dose.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

He’s been in practice for 30 years. He’s never heard of any such unusual deaths before of doctors. Zero in 30 years. Why is he now, all of a sudden, hearing of so many deaths, and why are these deaths all happening very soon after vaccination?</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">From July 13 to July 28, 7 doctors died… <strong>an average of one doctor every other day for 2 weeks straight</strong>. And <strong>the causes of death</strong> were statistically unusual: two died swimming (which is very rare), one died in her sleep (very rare), etc.</p>\n<p>The fact checkers assure us all that all of these doctors died for other reasons; the fact that they all died right after the vaccine was simply bad luck. That’s not the right metric. The fact checkers need to <strong>tell us the last time this happened where 7 doctors died in 14 days from unusual causes</strong>. They cannot. This is unprecedented.</p>\n<p>The Canadian doctors continue to ignore the deaths in plain sight and continue to believe what they are told to believe. I predict the next shots will be even worse.</p>\n<p>Sadly, I don’t think the Canadian doctors are ever going to figure this out.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>14 deaths of young doctors in the last 9 months, all shortly after the jab</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"§-deaths-of-young-doctors-in-the-last-months-all-shortly-after-the-jab\" class=\"header-anchor-widget\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<p>Canadian doctors keep lining up to get the shots to be “protected” from a disease which is <a href=\"https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/how-im-treating-my-covid\">easily treatable with a combination of drugs</a> with little to no side effects.</p>\n<p>A doctor friend in Canada has been passively noticing the untimely death of doctors in Canada shortly after they were forced to get the third and fourth doses of the vaccine. He sent me these images below which had been sent to him. He’s not proactively researching these. There are likely a lot more deaths he doesn’t know about.</p>\n<p>Guess how many similar deaths (young doctors dying unexpectedly of odd causes) he’s noticed in the past 30 years in practice? Yup, zero.</p>\n<p>What’s astounding is that this is a vaccine, which according to this <a href=\"https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/fda-discovers-fountain-of-youth\">CDC study</a>, makes it nearly impossible for you to die after the shot. Yet, these doctors all died shortly after the shot. The doctors are dead, so the CDC study must be wrong.</p>\n<p>Oddly, none of the deaths were covered in the Canadian mainstream media, so I thought you should know about them.</p>\n<p>There was coverage of six recent deaths in Health Impact News: <a href=\"https://healthimpactnews.com/2022/6-canadian-medical-doctors-died-within-2-weeks-after-4th-covid-booster-shots-for-employees-started-at-one-hospital/\">6 Canadian Medical Doctors Died Within 2 Weeks After 4th COVID Booster Shots for Employees Started at One Hospital</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me be very clear. <strong>You cannot have 14 Canadian doctors die shortly after the vaccine if there isn’t something wrong with the shot</strong>. Period. Full stop. Each of these is a very rare event. Having them clustered like this is a sure sign the vaccines killed them.</p>\n<p>Any honest scientist would start with this hypothesis as the most obvious hypothesis and only reject it if there was compelling evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p><strong>The vaccine kills people in subtle ways that are NOT being investigated by medical examiners. They are deliberately looking the other way.</strong></p>\n<p>Two of the most popular methods used by the vaccine to kill people are accelerating a cancer (which may have started from an earlier dose) and by causing a sudden death which, if the person is driving or swimming, appears to be a car accident or drowning.</p>\n<p>Nearly all the medical examiners all look the other way when assessing a vaccine-caused death.</p>\n<p>For example, I know a technician who works for a medical examiner who is seeing all these odd “blood clots,” but he says the pathologists “won’t listen or investigate”!</p>\n<p><img class=\"sizing-normal aligncenter\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b44679e-f229-4265-8aee-8de014eff01e_1032x728.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b44679e-f229-4265-8aee-8de014eff01e_1032x728.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b44679e-f229-4265-8aee-8de014eff01e_1032x728.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b44679e-f229-4265-8aee-8de014eff01e_1032x728.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b44679e-f229-4265-8aee-8de014eff01e_1032x728.png 1456w\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"338.6046511627907\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7b44679e-f229-4265-8aee-8de014eff01e_1032x728.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:1032,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:480,&quot;bytes&quot;:220243,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}\"></p>\n<p>Why are people looking the other way?

Move along.</strong></p>\n<div id=\"§fact-checkers-nothing-to-see-here-folks-move-along\" class=\"header-anchor-widget\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-canada-doctors-deaths-covid-vaccines-352319081218\">fact checkers</a>, none of these doctors died from the shots, they all died of other causes. Duh. The vaccine always kills people by stopping their heart, brain, etc. so it always looks like they died from something else because they did.</p>\n<p>But when normally healthy people all of a sudden die like this in rapid succession, you are being totally disingenuous if you rule out the vaccine as the likely instigator of the death.</p>\n<p>What the fact checkers fail to point out is that in many cases, the diseases often first started after the first vaccine shot, and then got worse with progressive shots. Somehow, they always miss that point that the vaccine accelerated the death. The fact that all these doctors died in close proximity to the shots is just too coincidental.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Canadian docs will keep believing the “safe and effective” narrative because that’s what they are trained to do: trust the authorities</strong></h2>\n<p>My doctor friends in Canada simply cannot believe how brainwashed his colleagues are. Zero deaths in 30 years, now all of a sudden 14 deaths in 9 months each happening shortly after their shots. Come on. That’s not bad luck. No way.</p>\n<p>The Canadian docs will continue to ignore the stats, believe the “fact checkers,” and line up for the shots.

Further, she discusses about the 115 different animal venoms contained within the &#8220;spike protein&#8221; (&#8220;Glycoprotein S&#8221;) and about the transmissibility of this bioweapon using graphene oxide nanoparticles as vectors. “They are not using viruses in any vaccines. It&#8217;s always been deadly bacteria extractions, like E. coli, to create lab generated Mycoplasmas and this is the root cause of all chronic illness.&#8221;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Conrad, Jr.</strong>, in 2007, was <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/judicialnominees/conrad.html\">appointed</a> to the Western District of North Carolina by President George W. Bush and will preside over the consolidated cases.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Over the past year of intensive discovery, we’ve been able to show that Merck, manufacturer of the Gardasil vaccine, was aware that there was an unacceptable risk of neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases and particularly <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots#:~:text=POTS%20is%20a%20form%20of,uncomfortable%2C%20rapid%20increase%20in%20heartbeat.\">postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome</a>, also known as POTS,” Robert F.

First, Merck argued that “individual issues in the cases will predominate” if the cases are consolidated, but the judicial panel was not persuaded.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“In this litigation, all plaintiffs allege that they were injured by the Gardasil vaccine in the same manner — through an autoimmune reaction caused by structural similarities between proteins in the vaccine’s antigens and within the vaccine recipient’s own cells. In view of the common issues arising from these allegations, we conclude that centralization will provide significant efficiencies,” the panel <a href=\"https://www.baumhedlundlaw.com/documents/gardasil-mdl-3036-08-04-2022-transfer-order-transferring-29-actions-to-judge-robert-j-conrad.pdf\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Merck also argued informal coordination among parties of the lawsuits “has been, and would continue to be, practicable,” but the panel found “efforts to date by Merck and movants’ counsel to coordinate in a limited number of actions appear to have been only partially successful at best.”</p>\n<p>Finally, Merck argued consolidation of the claims subject to the “Vaccine Act” would be “unprecedented” and “would attract a flood of meritless claims brought solely for the purpose of exhausting the claim process under the Vaccine Act and proceeding with tort claims in court.”</p>\n<p>Merck was referring to the fact that claimants bringing the lawsuits were first required to go through the <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html\">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> (NVICP), established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, before they could file their claims in an actual court of law.</p>\n<p>The NVICP is a special, <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/biden-gun-makers-liability-covid-vaccine-makers/\">no-fault tribunal</a> housed within the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that handles injury claims for 16 federally recommended vaccines. To date, the court has <a href=\"https://www.mctlaw.com/vaccine-injury/vaccinations/coronavirus-covid-19/\">awarded</a> more than $4 billion to thousands of people for vaccine injuries despite the system’s shortcomings.</p>\n<p>In the NVICP, America’s legal system is replaced by a “special master.” The special masters who review claims are government-appointed attorneys, many of whom are former U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys.</p>\n<p>Under the NVICP, the parents of vaccine-injured children are forced to sue the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for compensation. HHS is represented by DOJ attorneys.</p>\n<p>It is exceptionally <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/william-yates-hazlehurst-autism-childhood-vaccine-injury-liability/\">difficult to obtain compensation</a> within the NVICP. The proceedings are often turned into drawn-out, contentious expert battles and the backlog of cases is substantial. Because of this, a single case can drag on for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Payouts, including attorneys’ fees, are funded by a 75-cent tax per vaccine. There is a $250,000 cap on pain and suffering and death benefits.</p>\n<p>Persons claiming injury from a covered vaccine may not sue the vaccine manufacturer or the healthcare provider that administered the vaccine in state or federal court unless they have exhausted the claim process in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p>Merck asserted such claims would “overwhelm the already overburdened claim process” resulting in an “improper evasion of the intended purposes of that process.”</p>\n<p>Merck further argued publicity surrounding the litigation would spread “misinformation” about vaccines and increase “vaccine hesitancy.”</p>\n<p>The panel was not convinced. The judicial panel said:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“None of these arguments persuades us that centralization is not warranted. While the panel has not previously centralized actions subject to the Vaccine Act, it has previously centralized vaccine-related personal injury actions, including actions subject to an administrative exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The Vaccine Act expressly permits claimants to file suit against vaccine manufacturers in federal court after exhausting the required claim process, and nothing in the Act […]  forbids centralization of such actions.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Nor are we convinced by Merck’s argument that the creation of an MDL [multi-district-litigation] will encourage the filing of meritless claims, as any such claims are more appropriately brought to the attention of the transferee court.”</p>\n<p>The court said concerns about the efficient functioning of the Vaccine Court and vaccine hesitancy are “properly raised elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>The panel’s job, they said, was to determine if the litigation involved “common questions of fact” and whether centralization of the litigation would serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses, and “produce efficiencies for the litigants and the judiciary.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Law firm representing plaintiffs pleased with ruling</strong></h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/judicial-panel-consolidates-gardasil-vaccine-lawsuits-in-multidistrict-litigation-mdl-301600558.html#\">press release</a>, lawyers from the firm Baum Hedlund Aristei &amp; Goldman in April 2022, filed a motion to consolidate 30 vaccine lawsuits pending in district courts throughout the U.S.</p>\n<p>As of July 28, the law firm said 48 cases were pending with at least 100 more to be filed in federal court.</p>\n<p>In their motion for consolidation, attorneys said the central question of all of the cases was whether Gardasil can cause autoimmune disorders, whether Merck adequately warned of the vaccine’s risks and whether Gardasil caused the plaintiff’s injuries.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“We are very pleased the JPML [U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation] decided to centralize the Gardasil litigation,” said Bijan Esfandiari, Gardasil lawyer and senior shareholder at Baum Hedlund. “Efficient coordination of the multidistrict litigation makes the most sense and gives the plaintiffs the best path for seeking and obtaining justice. Our clients are looking forward to getting their day in court.”</p>\n<p>Esfandiari, whose firm represents young men and women across the country who allege serious injuries from Gardasil, said some of the most common side effects alleged in the HPV vaccine lawsuits include:</p>\n\nautonomic dysfunction\ncomplex regional pain syndrome\npremature ovarian failure\nfibromyalgia\nmyalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome\northostatic intolerance\nPOTS\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/health-lawsuits-united-states-f99aa981a56e55c289a6ec6e2d45d84e\">press release</a>, Judge Conrad will likely schedule a conference in the near future and establish procedures for the selection of lead and co-lead counsel for the Gardasil multi-district-litigation along with the selection of the executive committee, steering committee and other positions. The court will also issue various orders on how discovery is to proceed and establish deadlines.</p>\n<p>Attorneys anticipate the trial against Merck over its Gardasil vaccine will begin in 2023.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Countless people suffered adverse effects from isolation, the loss of 22 million jobs, shuttered businesses, closed schools, and the inability to have pre-existing medical conditions treated in a timely manner. Mental disorders skyrocketed.  </em></p>\n<p><em>Among adults, moderate to severe anxiety increased 37 percent and 30 percent for depression. </em></p>\n<p><em>It was worse for young adults and teens; the Century Foundation states 43 percent of younger adults reported anxiety conditions. Behind this pain and suffering is a national healthcare system that has become a predatory phenomenon. Medical costs are outrageous and insurance coverage charges for every conceivable medical service and item imaginable. Most people with health insurance are denied full coverage. This has resulted in millions of Americans being placed in debt peonage and on the threshold of bankruptcy.</em></p>\n<p>The question is what can be done to bring<strong> an out of control medical industrial complex</strong> into line to serve the needs of American citizens which other nations’ healthcare systems have done for decades.  The answer remains the same as it has been for the past half century. Universal healthcare.</p>\n<p>For a nation that prides itself on being the world&#8217;s wealthiest, most innovative and technologically advanced, the US&#8217; healthcare system is nothing less than a disaster and disgrace. Not only are Americans the least healthy among the most developed nations, but the US&#8217; health system also <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/journal-article/2017/jul/last-first-could-us-health-care-system-become-best-world?redirect_source=/publications/in-brief/2017/jul/last-to-first-could-us-health-system-become-best-in-world%20%20\">ranks dead last</a> among high-income countries. Despite rising costs and our unshakeable faith in American medical exceptionalism, average life expectancy in the US has remained lower than other OECD nations for many years and continues to decline. During the pandemic it is estimated that two to three years was lot on average life expectancy. On the other hand, before the Covid-19 pandemic, countries with universal healthcare coverage found their average life expectancy stable or slowly increasing.  The fundamental problem in Washington is that both parties have been far too beholden to the pharmaceutical, HMO and private insurance industries. Neither has made any concerted effort to reign in the corruption of corporate campaign funding and do what is sensible, financially feasible and morally correct to improve Americans&#8217; quality of health and well-being.</p>\n<p>The fact that our healthcare system is horribly broken is proof that moneyed interests have become so powerful to keep single-payer debate out of the media spotlight and censored. Poll after poll shows that the American public favors the expansion of public health coverage.  Other incremental proposals, including Medicare and Medicaid buy-in plans, are also widely preferred to the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare mess we are currently stuck with.</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to understand how the dismal state of American medicine is the result of a system that has been completely sold out to the free-market ideology and the bottom line interests of drug makers, healthcare mega-corporations, and an inflated private insurance industry. How advanced and ethically sound can a healthcare system be if tens of millions of people have no access to medical care because it is financially out of their reach? At the <a href=\"https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/healthcare-statistics/https://policyadvice.net/insurance/insights/healthcare-statistics/\">end of 2021</a>, 30 million Americans did not have health insurance including 9 million children. Almost 40 million more are underinsured.</p>\n<p>The United Nations recognizes healthcare as a human right. In the 2018, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon denounced the American healthcare system as &#8220;politically and morally wrong.&#8221;  Ki-moon belongs to a group known as The Elders founded by Nelson Mandela and funded by Sir Richard Branson and musician Peter Gabriel, a group of older wise statespersons around the world determined to tackle global crises during their remaining years and unafraid to take on the capitalist system. Among their initiatives is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/25/ex-un-chief-ban-kioon-says-us-healthcare-system-is-morally-wrong\">global universal healthcare</a>. As it turns out, the US has been the most influential roadblock to reach that goal.</p>\n<p>The US&#8217; healthcare system is a public economic failure, benefiting no one except the large and increasingly consolidated insurance firms at the top that ultimately supervise the racket.  It spends twice that of any other country, making up 18 percent of national GDP in 2019. The entire system is an example of the nation’s moral deterioration that also fuels a steady rise of inequality for the past three decades.</p>\n<p>Our political parties have wrestled with single-payer or universal healthcare for decades. Obama ran his first 2008 presidential campaign on a single-payer platform. His campaign health adviser, the late Dr. Quentin Young from the University of Illinois Medical School, was one of the nation&#8217;s leading voices calling for universal health coverage since 1986.   Among the 35 most developed OECD nations, 32 have some form of national universal care.  However, past efforts to even raise the issue have been viciously attacked. A huge army of private interests is determined to keep the public enslaved to private insurers and high medical costs. The failure of our healthcare is in no small measure due to it being a fully for-profit operation.  Consider that there are currently 907 private insurance companies in the US, which earned the industry $881 billion in 2020. Older corporate rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans argue that a single-payer or socialized medical program is unaffordable. However, not only is single-payer affordable, it will in the long-term save $2 trillion or more annually. It will end bankruptcies due to unpayable medical debt. In addition, universal healthcare, structured on a preventative model, will reduce disease rates at the outset.</p>\n<p>During a private conversation with Dr. Young shortly before his passing in 2016, he conveyed his sense of betrayal at the hands of the Obama administration. Dr. Young was in his 80s when he joined the Obama campaign team to help lead the young Senator to victory on a promise that America would finally catch up with other nations. The doctor sounded like a defeated man. He shared how he was manipulated, and that Obama held no sincere intention to make universal healthcare a part of his administration&#8217;s agenda. During the closed-door negotiations, which spawned the weak and compromised Affordable Care Act, Dr. Young was neither consulted nor invited to participate. In fact, he told us that he never heard from Obama again after his White House victory.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the principal parties meeting with the Obama administration were from the private insurance and medical industries. It was this cartel that created Obamacare. It was left to the charismatic Obama and bureaucrats in his administration to tailor the disingenuous narrative to convince Americans it was a spectacular public victory. Looking back, Obama&#8217;s domestic promises and accomplishments, including Obamacare, were anemic at best. His policies only further muddied the bureaucratic waters and public interests with esoteric taxes, shortsighted giveaways, and regulatory hurdles.  Meanwhile, the physical and mental health of the nation continues to erode.</p>\n<p>Today the pharmaceutical, HMO, and insurance industries, as well as medicine&#8217;s most prominent professional associations, medical schools and Wall Street firms form a powerful force with its tentacles wrapped around the throats of politicians and the federal health agencies. In 2021, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries alone spent over half a billion dollars on lobbying Washington.</p>\n<p>Corporate Democrats argue that Obama&#8217;s Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a positive step inching the country towards complete public coverage. However, aside from providing coverage to the poorest of Americans, Obamacare turned into another financial anchor around the necks of millions more.  Since the law was enacted, the average price for a family health policy rose by $2,200. <a href=\"http://www.actuary.org/content/prescription-drug-spending-us-health-care-system\">During the same period</a>, patient out-of-pocket hospitalization costs increased to $329 billion. The ACA is riddled with loopholes benefiting the private insurers who wrote the bill. Rather than healthcare spending falling, as Obama promised, it has exploded.  Trump made matters worse. Under his administration, an additional <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-264.html\">7 million Americans</a> fell into medical hardship and joined the uninsured. Today, one in 10 children under 18 are uninsured, an increase of 5 percent under Obama to <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-264.html\">almost 10 percent</a> before Biden took office. These figures are in no way indicative of a &#8220;strong economy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Clearly, a universal healthcare program will require flipping the script on the entire private insurance industry, which employed over half a million people last year. During the years 2015 to the end of 2018, private insurance profiles rose almost 600 percent. And profits continue to surge. Topping the list, <em>The Guardian</em> reported that United Healthcare Group alone earned $4.3 billion in profit during the first year of the pandemic, far beating out its expectations.  None of this extreme wealth went directly towards preventing disease. Private insurance is a middle-man scam.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the most volatile debate concerning a national universal healthcare system concerns cost.  Although there is already a socialized healthcare system in place &#8212; every federal legislator, bureaucrat, government employee and veteran benefits from it &#8212; fiscal Republican conservatives and groups such as the Koch Brothers network, including the Koch-funded Mercatus Center at George Mason University, are single-mindedly dedicated to preventing the expansion of Medicare and Medicaid. A Mercatus analysis made the outrageous claim that a single-payer system would increase federal health spending by $32 trillion in ten years. However, analyses and reviews by the Congressional Budget Office in the early 1990s concluded that such a system would only increase spending at the start; enormous savings would quickly offset it as the years pass.  <a href=\"http://www.gp.org/single_payer_will_lower_the_total_cost_of_health_care%20%20\">In one analysis</a>, &#8220;the savings in administrative costs [10 percent of health spending] would be more than enough to offset the expense of universal coverage.&#8221; High administrative costs overshadow all aspects of US healthcare, not just the insurance industry. Twenty-five percent of hospital spending is administrative, compared to 16 percent in the UK. In 2015, CNBC reported that $275 billion was wasted in insurance paperwork. In addition, there are billing services, which in 2012 averaged $471 billion to physicians, hospitals, supply services, and private and public insurers.  The Green Party&#8217;s Dr. Margaret Flowers, the national coordinator of Health Over Profit for Everyone, argues that <a href=\"http://www.gp.org/single_payer_will_lower_the_total_cost_of_health_care%20%20\">a single payer system</a> is &#8220;the best way to put private insurers on the margins of our healthcare system and to control the pharmaceutical industry&#8221; as well as their exorbitant drug prices.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Indeed, a universal healthcare system would increase federal spending. But at the same time, independent analyses indicate it would reduce the nation&#8217;s total healthcare costs, a critical goal we should strive towards. Compared to other nations, the US spends a disproportionate amount on healthcare.  <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/184955/us-national-health-expenditures-per-capita-since-1960\">According to Statistica</a>, as of 2021, the US spent approximately $12,531 per person. However, as we will note below, this is a misleading figure. It conceals the deeper problems running through the system.  Compare this to Switzerland, the second highest per capita spender at $8,000.   <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/%23item-average-wealthy-countries-spend-half-much-per-person-health-u-s-spends\">After the US and Switzerland</a>, per capita expenditures decrease dramatically, with Germany (the third highest) at $5,700.  France, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Australia and the UK each spend less than half of the US.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/06/how-we-spend-3400000000000/530355/\">An investigative review</a> published by <em>The Atlantic</em> found that more than half of healthcare spending goes to only five percent of patients! If this money were equally distributed, then the $12,500 per capita expenditure for every adult and child might make sense. The writer calls this tiny segment of patients who dominate health costs the &#8220;Platinum Patients.&#8221;  Most of these medical &#8220;frequent flyers&#8221; are the elderly and the chronically ill who have reached the final months or days of their lives. This is where tens of billions of dollars in care and treatment are spent annually. This segment of patients is also the most lucrative for private insurers, hospitals and doctors – patients whose charts can be larded with unnecessary diagnostic tests, drug prescriptions and medical procedures to further scam the system.</p>\n<p>Funding a National Health Program would primarily be accomplished by raising taxes to levels comparable to other developed nations. Senator Bernie Sanders and some of the younger Democrat progressives in the House would tax the highest multimillion-dollar earners 60-70 percent. Despite the outrage of its critics, including old rank-and-file multi-millionaire Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, this is still far less than in the past. During the Korean War, the top tax rate was 91 percent; it declined to 70 percent in the late 1960s. Throughout most of the 1970s, those in the lowest income bracket were taxed at 14 percent. Life, including healthcare, was affordable then.</p>\n<p>But Democratic supporters of the ACA who oppose a universal healthcare plan ignore the additional twenty new Obama taxes that were levied to pay for the program. These included surtaxes on investment income, Medicare taxes from those earning over $200,000, taxes on tanning services, an excise tax on medical equipment, and a 40 percent tax on health coverage for costs over the designated cap that applied to flexible savings and health savings accounts.  The entire ACA was reckless, sloppy and unnecessarily complicated from the start.  And the people who suffered most from the covert economic details, yet were mandated by law to purchase private insurance, were those who just missed the poverty line cutoff.</p>\n<p>The fact that Obamacare further strengthened the distinctions between two parallel systems &#8212; federal and private &#8212; with entirely different economic structures created a labyrinth of red tape, rules, and wasteful bureaucracy. Since the ACA went into effect, over 150 new boards, agencies and programs have had to be established to monitor its 2,700 pages of gibberish. A federal single-payer system would easily eliminate this bureaucracy and waste.</p>\n<p>A medical New Deal to establish universal healthcare coverage is a decisive step in the correct direction. The energy behind the younger generation of Democrat legislators is admirable, but we question whether they possess the wisdom to address the fullness of our health crisis. We must look at the crisis holistically and in a systemic way.  Simply shuffling private insurance into a federal Medicare-for-all or buy-in program, funded by taxing the wealthiest of citizens, may only reduce costs temporarily. It will not curtail nor slash escalating rates of disease. Any effective healthcare reform must also tackle the underlying reasons for Americans&#8217; poor state of health. We cannot shy away from examining the social illnesses infecting our entire free-market capitalist culture and its addiction to deregulation. A viable healthcare model would have to structurally transform how the medical economy operates. Finally, a successful medical New Deal must honestly evaluate the best and most reliable scientific evidence in order to effectively redirect public health spending.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/27/the-u-s-spends-more-on-health-care-than-any-other-country-heres-what-were-buying/?utm_term=.27bd1bc2855e%20%20\">For example</a>, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama healthcare adviser, observed that AIDS-HIV measures consume the most public health spending, even though the disease &#8220;ranked 75th on the list of diseases by personal health expenditures.&#8221; On the other hand, according to the American Medical Association, a large percentage of the nation&#8217;s $3.4 trillion healthcare spending goes towards treating preventable diseases, notably diabetes, common forms of heart disease, and back and neck pain conditions. In 2016, these three conditions were the most costly and accounted for approximately <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/27/the-u-s-spends-more-on-health-care-than-any-other-country-heres-what-were-buying/?utm_term=.27bd1bc2855e\">$277 billion in spending</a>.  Earlier this year, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html20%20%20\">CDC announced</a> that the autism rate is now 1 in 44 children, a 7 percent increase since 2016. In 2015, the economic burden of autism disorders was $268 billion; it is expected to almost double to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/316036/cost-of-autism-spectrum-disorders-us/\">$461 billion by 2025</a>.  There are no signs that this alarming trend will reverse and decline; and yet, our entire federal health system has failed to search honestly and conscientiously for the underlying causes of this epidemic. All explanations that might interfere with the pharmaceutical industry’s unchecked growth, such as over-vaccination, are ignored and viciously discredited without any sound scientific evidence.  Therefore, a proper medical New Deal will require a systemic overhaul and reform of our federal health agencies, especially the CDC and FDA. For any medical revolution to succeed in advancing universal healthcare, the plan must prioritize spending in a manner that serves public health and not private interests. It will also require reshuffling private corporate interests and their lobbyists to the sidelines, away from any strategic planning, in order to break up the private interests’ control over federal agencies and its revolving door policies. Aside from those who benefit from this medical corruption, the overwhelming majority of Americans would agree with this criticism. However, there is a complete lack of national trust that our legislators, including the so-called progressives, would be willing to undertake such actions.</p>\n<p>In addition, America&#8217;s healthcare system, as well as the so-called Green New Deal, ignores the single most critical initiative to reduce costs &#8211; that is, preventative efforts and programs instead of deregulation and closing loopholes designed to protect the drug and insurance industries&#8217; bottom line.  Prevention can begin with banning toxic chemicals that are proven health hazards associated with current disease epidemics.  This should be a no-brainer for any legislator who cares for public health.  Unfortunately, unlike Europe, the US continues to permit numerous toxic chemicals, including many known carcinogens, to find their way into common everyday products. <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/banned-europe-safe-us/%20%20\">For example</a>, Stacy Malkan, co-founder of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, notes that &#8220;the policy approach in the US and Europe is dramatically different&#8221; when it comes to chemical allowances in cosmetic products.  Whereas the EU has banned 1,328 toxic substances from the cosmetic industry alone, the US has banned only 11.  <a href=\"https://www.beautybyearth.com/over-1000-toxic-ingredients-banned-in-europe-but-not-in-us/\">The US continues</a> to allow carcinogenic formaldehyde, petroleum, many parabens (an estrogen mimicker and endocrine hormone destroyer), the highly allergenic p-phenylenediamine or PBD, triclosan, which has been associated with the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria, avobenzone, and many others to be used in cosmetics, sunscreens, shampoo and hair dyes.</p>\n<p>Another reason Europeans are much healthier than Americans is because their governments take more immediate preventative measures to remove chemicals shown to pose serious health risks. The US can easily adopt this policy in order to reduce avoidable healthcare costs. Corporations should no longer be given a free pass to poison the population for nothing more than expediency and profit. There are no safe levels for any carcinogenic and hormone-disrupting chemical, and that applies across the board &#8211; for every healthy and sickly man, woman and child.</p>\n<p>Next, the food Americans consume can be reevaluated for its health benefits. There should be no hesitation to tax the unhealthiest foods, such as commercial junk food, sodas and candy, products that contain ingredients proven to be toxic, and meat products laden with dangerous chemicals including growth hormones and antibiotics. The scientific evidence that the average American diet is contributing to rising disease trends is indisputable. We could also implement additional taxes on the public advertising of these demonstrably unhealthy products.  All such tax revenue would accrue to a national universal health program to offset medical expenditures associated with the very illnesses linked to these products. Although such tax measures would help pay for a new medical New Deal, it may be combined with programs to educate the public about healthy nutrition if it is to produce a reduction in the most common preventable diseases. Taxing alone is not sufficient. The public will need to understand the reasons why their favorite junk foods are being taxed and the health risks they face by consuming them. Preventative health education should be mandatory throughout public school systems.</p>\n<p>Measures to improve the quality of Americans&#8217; health demand a harsh reality check. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the US spent $3.4 trillion annually on healthcare.  <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf\">After the first year</a> of the pandemic, healthcare spending rose over 9 percent to $4.1 trillion.  A question most of us might ask is how much of this $4 trillion was complete, avoidable waste?</p>\n<p>Private insurers force hospitals, clinics and private physicians into financial corners, and this is contributing to prodigious waste in money and resources. Annually, healthcare spending towards medical liability insurance costs tens of billions of dollars. In particular, this economic burden has taxed small clinics and physicians. It is well past the time that physician liability insurance is replaced with no-fault options. Today&#8217;s doctors are spending an inordinate amount of money to protect themselves. Legions of liability and trial lawyers seek big paydays for themselves stemming from physician error. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2010/09/07/the-true-cost-of-medical-malpractice-it-may-surprise-you/%236a9856bb2ff5\"><em>Forbes</em> reports</a> that the cost of medical malpractice runs at about $55 billion per year.  This has created a culture of fear among doctors and hospitals, resulting in the overly cautious practice of defensive medicine, driving up costs and insurance premiums just to avoid lawsuits. Doctors are forced to order unnecessary tests and prescribe more medications and medical procedures just to cover their backsides.  In 2017, $200 billion was spent on unnecessary medical tests, compared to $6.8 billion just 6 years earlier. The blowback has been a tragic rise in medical errors, patient injuries and deaths.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/the-high-cost-of-medication-errors-0001\">According to a 2017 review</a> by Dr. Raj Gopalan, vice president of Innovation and Clinical Informatics at Wolters Kluwer, there are at least two million confirmed adverse drug reactions in the US every year, causing 100,000 deaths. These medication errors and complications add an additional $136 billion to the US&#8217;s annual healthcare bill. Furthermore, there is the loss of work and productivity due to medical error. The <em>Journal of Health Care Finance </em>estimates that every year, 10 million work days valued at approximately $1.2 billion are lost due to measurable medical errors. The reality is likely worse. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23155743\">An earlier analysis</a> by Loyola University Medical School estimated that the total economic impact across the board for all losses due to iatrogenic events and deaths is nearly $1 trillion annually.</p>\n<p>No-fault insurance is a common-sense plan that enables physicians to pursue their profession in a manner that will reduce iatrogenic injuries and costs. Individual cases requiring additional medical intervention and loss of income would still be compensated. This would generate huge savings. Reports indicate that the US is experiencing a severe shortage of doctors. The greatest shortages are in emergency medicine and general practice. This trend notably escalated during the pandemic.  Too many medical school graduates are entering more financially lucrative medical specialties. We believe that all medical and nursing education should be free. From the time students graduate, they should receive an excellent living wage, even before proceeding to any specialty, without the specter of debt looming over their future.</p>\n<p>No other nation suffers from the scourge of excessive drug price gouging like the US. After many years of haggling to lower prices and increase access to generic drugs, no substantial progress has been made. Even generic drug prices are now skyrocketing, according to a CBS News investigation. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-60-minutes/\">A <em>60 Minutes</em> feature</a> about the Affordable Care Act reported an &#8220;orgy of lobbying and backroom deals in which just about everyone with a stake in the $3-trillion-a-year health industry came out ahead—except the taxpayers.” For example, <em>Life Extension</em> magazine reported that an antiviral cream (acyclovir), which had lost its patent protection, &#8220;was being sold to pharmacies for 7,500% over the active ingredient cost. <a href=\"https://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/2017/3/As-We-See-It/Page-01\">The active ingredient</a> (acyclovir) costs only 8 pennies, yet pharmacies are paying a generic maker $600 for this drug and selling it to consumers for around $700.&#8221; The active ingredient in the drug tretinoin costs 80 cents to the manufacturer, yet a full bottle costs $1,100. Other examples include the antibiotic Doxycycline. The price per pill averages 7 cents to $3.36 but has a 5,300 percent markup when it reaches the consumer. The antidepressant Clomipramine is marked up 3,780 percent, and the anti-hypertensive drug Captopril’s mark-up is 2,850 percent. <a href=\"https://www.lifeextension.com/Magazine/2016/3/New-England-Journal-of-Medicine-Exposes-Generic-Price-Scandal/Page-01\">And these are generic drugs</a>! These numbers reveal how bloated and rapacious the medical industrial complex is. Drug prices like these are another reason why the US has failed to successfully launch a national universal healthcare program for all.</p>\n<p>Medication costs need to be dramatically cut to allow drug manufacturers a reasonable but not obscene profit margin. By capping profits approximately 100 percent above all costs, we would save our system hundreds of billions of dollars. Such a measure would also extirpate the growing corporate misdemeanors of pricing fraud, which forces patients to pay out-of-pocket in order to make up for the costs insurers are unwilling to pay.</p>\n<p>Likewise for exorbitant hospital costs. A one dollar bag of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/health/exploring-salines-secret-costs.html\">intravenous saline</a> can cost up to $546, plus an additional $127 for administration. If given in a hospital ER, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/health/exploring-salines-secret-costs.html\">a single aspirin pill</a> can cost $30, six times the pharmacy&#8217;s cost for a full bottle.  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/health/exploring-salines-secret-costs.html\">A Fox News report</a> discovered that a visit to the ER for a headache might bankrupt you with over a $17,700 bill, or bilk you with a $24,100 bill for a sprained ankle. Unfortunately, the private insurance industry permits this unchecked price-gouging, and hospitals simply take advantage of the medical services racket.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its harsh corporate critics, a single-payer program is completely feasible and well within the nation&#8217;s reach. <a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/02/04/medicare-for-all-is-not-a-fantasy\">Dean Baker</a> at the Center for Economics and Policy Research states, &#8220;The government already pays for almost half of the nation’s health care bill through Medicare, Medicaid, veterans’ benefits and other public sector programs. Achieving Medicare for All would mean covering the other half of current expenses, along with the additional costs of paying for the uninsured and under-insured who are not getting the care they need.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Finally, we can acknowledge that our healthcare is fundamentally a despotic rationing system based upon high insurance costs vis-a-vis a toss of the dice to determine where a person sits on the economic ladder.  For the past three decades it has contributed to inequality. The present insurance-based economic metrics cast millions of Americans out of coverage because private insurance costs are beyond their means. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/Exprts_intrvw/u_reinhardt.htm%20%20\">Uwe Reinhardt</a>, a Princeton University political economist, has called our system &#8220;brutal&#8221; because it &#8220;rations [people] out of the system.&#8221;  He defined rationing as &#8220;withholding something from someone that is beneficial.&#8221; Discriminatory healthcare rationing now affects over 35 million people who have been priced out the system and left uninsured. They make too much to qualify for Medicare under Obamacare, yet earn far too little to afford private insurance costs and premiums. Out-of-pocket expenses for services insurers refuse to provide can also bankrupt a family. In the final analysis, the entire system is discriminatory and predatory.</p>\n<p>However, we must be realistic. Almost every member of Congress has benefited from the flow of Big Pharma and private insurance money into their electoral campaign pockets. The only way to begin to bring our healthcare program up to the level of a truly developed nation is to remove the drug industry&#8217;s rampant and unnecessary profiteering from the equation.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Translated from German</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV:</strong> Peter König worked as an economist at the World Bank for over 30 years and has implemented water projects in developing countries on various continents. I am pleased to welcome Peter König to Kla.TV. Can you tell us something about your current job?</p>\n<p><strong>Peter Koenig: </strong> First: Thank you for allowing me to be with you and speak to you. I am an economist and geopolitical analyst and try as best as possible to reflect the ever-changing &#8220;today&#8217;s&#8221;/ resp. to analyze &#8220;tomorrow&#8217;s&#8221; situations. In other words, to connect the dots: the dots between Covid, the Ukraine war, the reset, the QR code that is becoming more and more obtrusive, the planned “Fourth Industrial Revolution” by <strong>Klaus Schwab.</strong></p>\n<p>This includes <strong>the plan to digitize everything including the human brain</strong> etc etc. So there are a lot of dots that can and must be connected in order to understand what is going on and what is planned. We have to know that in principle nothing is and remains stagnant, except for the big goal at the moment: The Great Reset, UN Agenda 2030, and the 4th Industrial Revolution. These are different descriptions for the same goal. You have to know that. They may have been made that way to confuse. But in principle it&#8217;s the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV:</strong> How would you describe the current financial situation? For the average consumer, everything is still – yes – pretty much in balance. He&#8217;s actually still doing pretty well.</p>\n<p><b>PK</b>: <span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\">Yes, that’s right. The average Joe living in Switzerland is relatively well off. But here in Switzerland, too, poverty has increased, and considerably so. Only here in Switzerland we don’t talk about it. It is taboo to be poor. The official unemployment figures in Switzerland in May this year were 2.1%, in April it was 2.3%, while at the end of December last year it was almost 5%. In my opinion, these figures are greatly</span><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\"> manipulated. It’s the same everywhere in the West, by the way. </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\">One would also need to know the unemployment</span><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\"> criteria: what is classified and</span><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\">considered as unemployment? How is day work, part-time work assessed? How are the different “classes” of jobs – construction work, clerical work, managerial/elite work, etc. – how are they included in the statistics? They’re not uniform. And I suppose I’m assuming that’s not being said either – these analyzes are available, that’s quite clear (in the statistics) – but they’re never published. </span><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\">And I wouldn’t be at all surprised if a lot of people today had to deal with part-time work and were classified as full-time employees.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #362f2d;\">In 2020 – the last number you can find openly – it was officially 8.5% of the people who were poor. How is poverty defined? A family of four with an income of less than 4,000 francs a month is poor in Switzerland. However, this criterion is not officially applied in Switzerland. Unofficially yes. But there is, I think, only in the canton of Geneva – recently – CHF 4,400 was named as an official poverty threshold number.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV</strong> : You say that we are in the final phase of a demonic plan. They set this with the UN Agenda 2030, the so-called &#8216;Great Reset&#8217; or the &#8216;4. Industrial Revolution&#8217;; they are the same. Can you tell us what you think are the goals of this plan or of the &#8216;Great Reset&#8217;?</p>\n<p><b>PK </b>: Yes, I would like to say very briefly as an introduction: The entire &#8216;Great Reset&#8217; – the Ukraine war, by the way, is an integral part of it. You just don&#8217;t notice it. The war is typically another&#8230; &#8211; a divider of people. True, war can never be justified, nor any kind of killing. But one can explain how it came to this: The constant provocation of NATO, which opposed the promise of the Allies &#8220;Not One Inch Further East than Berlin&#8221; at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union &#8211; that was what the US Secretary of State, then <strong>James Baker</strong>, said and actually promised. And nobody respected that.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you mention even a half-hearted argument for Putin, you are a frowned upon and hated as a Putin lover. There are even Swiss officers who did that, who worked in Ukraine, who were in NATO and see the matter clearly. That&#8217;s what they said. They are now censored. Imagine that. This is also known as “divide and conquer”. The media play a powerful role in indoctrinating the population with lies practically 24 x 7 and for the last &#8211; more than two years &#8211; they have been very successful. They are literally subsidized with billions, these lies. So that means the media were and are &#8220;subsidized&#8221;, or rather corrupted.</p>\n<p>In short, what the West, especially <strong>the United States, has always wanted is control of the largest and richest country in the world, Russia. </strong>With by far the most mineral resources in the world. All natural resources that the West needs, not least for their war industry. The &#8220;rare earths&#8221;. So these are metals that are used primarily in electronics. The biggest consumer in electronics is the war industry and of course our western luxury lifestyle. In order to maintain that, we also need these raw materials, which can mainly be supplied by Russia and China.</p>\n<p>In my view, the <strong>&#8216;Great Reset&#8217;</strong> has three equal and devastating but related goals:</p>\n<p><strong>First: depopulation:</strong> That means massive depopulation. The eugenists are at work.</p>\n<p>That was a plan of the &#8216;Club of Rome&#8217; 50 years ago. And it was clearly stated in their report &#8220;Limit to Growth&#8221; from 1972. It was also part of the basis for the first formulations for the European Union.</p>\n<p>Covid-19 was the targeted and psychologically sophisticated method of intimidation with a virus that you don&#8217;t see, of course, that never existed as such.</p>\n<p>A new virus that has never been identified. It is flu-like and has a mortality rate roughly equal to that of the annual flu. About 0.07 to 0.1 percent of infections.</p>\n<p>And this applies above all to older people who are already suffering from other comorbidities. But the fear mongering has caused that, mostly under pressure and blackmail, between 60 and 80% of the western population let themselves be “vaccinated”.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>And so I put &#8220;vaccination&#8221; in quotation marks, because it&#8217;s not a vaccination. And that&#8217;s why I prefer to call it, they got vaxxed.</p>\n<p>With a substance or substances containing genetically alterable components mRNA plus various toxins, like graphene oxide that cause serious diseases like heart failure , various types of cancer , kidney failure and so on. And in many cases, as we have seen, they are obviously fatal.</p>\n<p>In fact, far more people have died from the effects of the so-called vaccination than from the effects of Covid. In addition, there is not one vaccination, there are different injections with different biochemical compositions. And we have to keep this in mind: There isn&#8217;t just one vaccine, one type of chemical that&#8217;s injected, there are different ones. I think to remember that real scientists once pointed out that there are at least five different species. But probably even more. And some of them are used in a targeted manner in certain countries and certain societies. So fear is the enemy&#8217;s greatest and strongest weapon, we must always keep that in mind.</p>\n<p>Second: So the second reason behind this trilogy is the shift of private and public-private capital, i.e. the combination of public and private, from the bottom and the middle to the top.</p>\n<p>Through artificially created economic crises, bankruptcies, etc., capital is shifted from below and from the middle up to a relatively thin layer of control-seeking, I would even call them criminal elites.</p>\n<p>One can also call these groups a cult. And I actually think they live by certain cult standards. In the cults, certain habits and certain groups of people are classified as a cult because they have to follow these norms in order to be successful.</p>\n<p>According to Forbes, the economics analyst, there were 2,668 billionaires on April 5 of this year (2022).</p>\n<p>An Elon Musk is apparently number one with 219 billion.</p>\n<p>You can clearly see that while the world population has become poorer, the wealth of the rich and especially the super-rich has multiplied. Bill Gates&#8217; wealth, just one example, has increased from $96 billion in 2019 to $129 billion this April (note: 2022). That&#8217;s about 34 percent more.</p>\n<p>While he is partially responsible for this plandemic &#8211; I call it a plandemic because it wasn&#8217;t a pandemic but a planned pandemic &#8211; for which he is responsible, for tens and tens of thousands of vaxx deaths.</p>\n<p>Then there are the financial companies like BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and also Fidelity and many others. And most importantly, the top three intertwined co-shareholders BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are estimated to control somewhere between US$20 and US$25 trillion (1 trillion = 1 with 12 zeros).</p>\n<p>They have leverage power of over $100 trillion. In contrast, the world gross national product is about US$ 95 trillion, that was at the end of last year (note: 2021). And with that power, they can coerce and blackmail literally any country, any government, any society. And we&#8217;ve seen that before. Those who do not participate are so-called &#8220;neutralized&#8221;. There are quite a few of them, especially in Africa.</p>\n<p>These are people, behind BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street et al – along with other billionaires – that you can in good conscience – I would say, call sick. That’s why they, who have such capital powers at their disposal, have to control people. But actually – we can’t imagine that, at least I can’t – what that can do for you.</p>\n<p>This is the state of the world today and we are only at the beginning of the 2030 Agenda. As long as people, the majority of people, suffer from what is called cognitive dissonance, we will continue to be dominated and manipulated until it comes to the next step. And so far this has been true. There are so many people, psychologists say, that this kind of affection, you can call it a disease, which is called cognitive dissonance, is one of the worst psychologically because it&#8217;s almost impossible to get rid of.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV</strong> : What do you think is the next step then?</p>\n<p><strong>PK: </strong>This is precisely the third item in this diabolical trilogy, the &#8216;Reset&#8217;. <strong>This is total digitization. Money, people, surveillance and control of everything. Humans become transhumans. </strong><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5723329 alignright\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"282\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset.jpg 500w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wef-reset-144x144.jpg 144w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\"></a>Klaus Schwab even said that in an interview on Swiss French television in 2016.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we have the so-called QR-code. QR stands for “Quick Response”. And the associated technology that allows storing at least 30,000 data of each individual– up to now, and that can be increased. What and where you are, buy, where you go, who you circulate with, who you talk to, your health status, your bank account, your police report – everything, everything, is being watched and recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>The most important tool for full digitization is 5G</strong>. That&#8217;s why we already find antennas everywhere. And 5G is already active in certain cantons. I was in Ticino the other day and my phone already showed 5G. Not yet here in the Geneva area. And 6G will probably come soon. Because the only reason, by far the biggest reason for this is the digitization of everything and above all of people.</p>\n<p>So: the QR code and the so-called VC derived from it – i.e. the “vaccine code” or “vaccine certificate code” (“vaccination certificate” in English) are the most dangerous thing that threatens us, what we face if we do nothing do about it. Because that means total surveillance. And once we&#8217;re there, it&#8217;s very, very difficult to get out of there.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV:</strong> But let me tell you: the QR code is now an integral part of everyday life. We have that everywhere. And you see it as the most dangerous thing that can happen to us. Can you describe the danger of this QR code in a little more detail?</p>\n<p><strong>PK</strong>: We can even be condemned to starvation via the QR code. How so?</p>\n<p>To do this, the QR code – or its successor, whatever it is called – has to be implanted in people in some way. And that&#8217;s what Klaus Schwab said back then in this short interview with Swiss-French television in Geneva, and that six years ago &#8211; he said: In about 2025, we will all have a chip either in our clothes or under our skin. Well, that was, maybe that&#8217;s his dream, I hope it doesn&#8217;t come to that, but he already announced it.</p>\n<p>And so we&#8217;re in an electro-&#8230; we become an electromagnetic field. We people. There are already test groups in Sweden, volunteer test groups, who have implanted a chip in their hand, about the size of a grain of rice. At the moment, as I said, these are only volunteers who are involved. And so they need this code, i.e. this chip, mainly for digital payment transactions. But they can of course be expanded. Their potential is practically unlimited.</p>\n<p>This is the basis for the QR-code, implanted into your body, and manipulable via 5G, or later 6G. One can easily imagine that someone who doesn&#8217;t live conform to the systems / the dictatorship&#8217;s requirements will be excluded form the payment system. That could mean, the person would not be able to buy food. The perso&#8217;s digital bank account may also be blocked, including the money in the account.</p>\n<p>The west is doing this routinely &#8211; maybe less with individuals, but with countries that dare not living up to the demands of the US empire. Europe, especially NATO countries usually follow suit stealing other countries&#8217; assets. Mind you, this is totally illegal under internatioal law. But nobody even cares anymore about international law.</p>\n<p>Among the most sanctioned countries are Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Syria &#8211; and many others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/expert-report-fifth-generation-5g-directed-energy-radiation-emissions-context-nanometal-contaminated-vaccines-include-covid-19-graphite-ferrous-oxide-antennas/5786727\">See also this on 5G</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV</strong> : Mr König, you said that everyone now has a QR code, how do you understand that?</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5769405 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code.jpg 1376w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code-768x440.jpg 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/qr-code-400x229.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px\"></a>PK</b>: Yes, well I&#8217;m assuming that everyone has at some point paid an invoice with a QR code on it. Even if you don&#8217;t need it to pay the bill, you still have associated your name, i.e. your own name, with this QR code and paid the bill, because that is an integral part of the payment slip that you use via the Bank paid or paid at post office counter.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, probably all of us &#8211; or almost all of us I&#8217;m assuming &#8211; have done a PCR test, either because we wanted to travel or because we wanted to go to a theater somewhere, or something&#8230; In the last two years you could yes hardly go to a restaurant or in many restaurants you could not go at all around here without either being vaccinated or having a QR test. Then. everyone who has a PCR test, has a QR code, and a personal QR code at that.</p>\n<p>This personal QR code, which is then just spread over or further used via an app on your cell phone. And this app is of course connected to a control center, we can’t do anything about it. The mobile phones are all already set up in such a way that they can be accessed from anywhere, even if you turn off the GPS, they know exactly where we are and what we do. If you don&#8217;t want this control, you literally have to throw your phone away. Or leave it at home. Very few people are willing do that.</p>\n<p>But apart from that: at some point you need this cellphone again and then you are connected to it, and if you just like I said, we talked about the injection that contains graphene oxide and graphene oxide is very, very electromagnetic. That&#8217;s the substance that&#8217;s needed, probably one of the substances, maybe the most important, that&#8217;s needed to manipulate us with 5G. It may be soon. I don&#8217;t know when that will happen, but it certainly can&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s already started for certain people.</p>\n<p>And then when that happens, the graphene oxide injection, we&#8217;ve practically got this substance of a <strong>QR code already built into our system.</strong> That&#8217;s how it works. And we can&#8217;t do anything about it, we don&#8217;t even know anymore. Most people&#8230; &#8211; I suppose very few people know that they have been vaccinated with a vaccine, so-called vaccine, which consists of graphene oxide, a highly magnetizable and electronically manipulable substance, very few people know that.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t even know that they probably already carry their QR code somewhere in their body. And those who haven&#8217;t done it yet have it on their cell phones. And we have to do something about that. There are people, there are effectively people, who say: We should try to go back in time, not to use cell phones anymore.</p>\n<p>The smart phone has been gradually and persistently &#8211; and ever more persistently, infiltrated into our lives that we cannot imagine a life, especially the younger people, the younger generation, without this cellphone at all can no longer imagine. Most people find this QR code great. When I talk to people, especially younger people, they think it is superb, because you use it to pay a bill in the supermarket or restaurant directly with your phone, just swipe it by a cashier&#8217;s device &#8211; and bingo, the bill is paid. They have absolutely no idea what the aim is, no idea at all, and they don’t want to listen either. I’m a weirdo. I’m sorry, this is unfortunately our world today.</p>\n<p>The digitized way of life, is driven into our brains with a flagrantly sophisticated lie-propaganda. When you know how much even the Swiss government, subsidized the media, or corrupts the media, it sounds unbelievable. The amount per capita in Switzerland – we only have 8.4 million inhabitants – is significantly higher than in the USA. A figure that has circulated is 1.7 billion Swiss francs (about the same in US dollars) over a period of 2 or 3 years. Just so, that the media say what the Swiss government and very likely WHO and the WEF wants them to say.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV</strong> : Would that be the transformation from &#8220;human&#8221; to &#8220;transhuman&#8221;, as Klaus Schwab had specified somewhere or was also prescribed or advertised by his diabolical top advisor, the author and historian <strong>Yuval Noah Harari?</strong> Harari talks about how &#8220;humans&#8221; will be hacked in the future&#8230;?</p>\n<p><b>PK</b>: <strong>Harari literally calls us humans “animals that can be hacked”</strong>. Those are his words, meaning “animals that can be hacked”. &#8220;Hacked&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;electronically infiltrated&#8221; and can be manipulated. &#8220;Animals that can be hacked&#8221; are us.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m assuming that this arrogant kind of impudence from Harari was exploited by Klaus Schwab, probably even encouraged, to scare people. The first motto of avoidance, of resistance, is not to be afraid &#8211; NEVER.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said that before and I&#8217;ll keep repeating it. Have no fear. Fear is their greatest weapon. That&#8217;s the worst. In other words, many of those who have already been vaccinated, i.e. the so-called vaccinated, have had graphene oxide injected. And graphene oxide works very well as an electromagnetic field through which one may be manipulated.</p>\n<p>And already with this manipulation a certain transhumanism is present. Most people don&#8217;t even know that. With 5G you can easily make remote-controlled transhumans out of it. That would be the total enslavement of the survivors; those who have just survived the reduction in world population. <img class=\"wp-image-5782645 alignright\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/leadwef3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/leadwef3.jpg 1280w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/leadwef3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/leadwef3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/leadwef3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/leadwef3-400x225.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\">From my point of view, this would be a life no longer worth living, but we would probably hardly notice it, because we are under the spell of artificial intelligence (AI) [= artificial intelligence (AI)], algorithms or just as Klaus Schwab called it <strong>“You will own nothing but be happy.” </strong></p>\n<p>The dark cabal or cult’s goal as I like to call it, to reach this point by 2030, upon fulfillment, after the implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 &#8211; so there are still 8 years to go &#8211; or also with the fulfillment of the &#8216;Great Reset&#8217;, or the fulfillment of the &#8216;4. Industrial Revolution&#8217;. As already mentioned, these are goals that are identical in the three synonymous programs, the terminologies are just different in order to confuse us.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV:</strong> Yes, do you see a possibility that these goals of total enslavement can still be prevented?</p>\n<p><strong>PK:</strong> Yes, there is still a lot missing, providing time to really wake people up, to wake up the majority. But it has to come to that. It is impossible for nature to be intimidated by such people — I can hardly call them people anymore, they are no longer humane.</p>\n<p>So: take consciousness to a higher level to avoid the manipulation of the dark cult. That&#8217;s a priority.</p>\n<p>In order to do that, we must&#8211;so I repeat&#8211;we must not be afraid. We must accept the acknowledgment of the lie that we have probably been exposed to for a lifetime. Because that is the power for overcoming of the so-called cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<p>And very important, very important, we must not feel or express hatred towards these perpetrators. Because if we do that – that&#8217;s basically what they want, if they scare us or intimidate us, then their aim is to cause hatred. Then we sit down on the same deep level as they are themselves. We&#8217;re not allowed to.</p>\n<p>So according to the motto &#8211; &#8220;We shall overcome&#8221; &#8211; we will master the situation &#8211; WITHOUT FEAR, I repeat again, WITHOUT FEAR, live towards the light and decide in peace for humanity. And so we can – I am convinced – save ourselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Kla.TV</strong> : Yes, Peter König, thank you very much for the interview. Thank you for taking the time. And yes, we will overcome together. Many Thanks.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter König</strong> : Nothing to thank for. I am grateful to you for letting me speak on your program and hopefully this message will reach some who are willing to get involved &#8211; also get involved spiritually. Many Thanks.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel. Feel free to repost and share Global Research articles.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Peter Koenig</strong> is a geopolitical analyst and a former Senior Economist at the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), where he worked for over 30 years around the world.

She’s the former Chief of Pathology, a field that she’s worked in for the last 25 years, with a specialty in breast cancer diagnosis for the past 18 years. She’s studied thousands of autopsies and breast cancer samples. She’s extremely familiar with the industry and patient age, tumor size, and malignancy grade are all within her field of expertise and have had a natural rhythm throughout her career. That natural rhythm came to a halt in 2021 once the vaccine rollout began.</em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rumble.com/c/c-1238333\">Doctors for Covid Ethics</a> posted an interview with her where she shared her concerns about unusual features that have been showing up in samples from the past year.</p>\n\n\n<strong>Age</strong> &#8211; The average ages of the samples she received dropped, with a rise in the number of samples from people in their 30’s-50’s.\n\n<strong>Size</strong> &#8211; It used to be unusual for Dr. Kruger to find a tumor 3 cm in size. In this new environment, she’s regularly seeing tumors of 4 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm, and the occasional 12 cm. In a shocking anecdote, 2 weeks ago she found a <strong>16 cm</strong> tumor that took up an entire breast.\n\n<strong>Multiple Tumors</strong> &#8211; Dr. Kruger has begun to see more cases of multiple tumors growing in the same patient, sometimes even in both breasts. She had 3 cases within 3 weeks of patients who had tumors growing in multiple organs. <strong>One had tumors in his/her breast, pancreas and lungs within months of getting vaccinated.</strong>\n\n\n<strong>Recurrence</strong> &#8211; There has been an uptick in patients who have been in remission from their cancer for many years, suddenly getting an aggressive recurrence of their cancer shortly after vaccination.\n\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Speaking Out</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"§speaking-out\" class=\"header-anchor-widget\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<p>Dr. Kruger initially thought that these turbo cancers, as she calls them, were due to delayed doctor appointments from Covid lockdowns, but that period is long over, and the tumors are still growing aggressively, and in younger patients. She reported some of these cases to the FDA, and while some higher-ups initially agreed to meet with her, they canceled the meeting with no explanation the next day and sent a phone agent to take her report instead.</p>\n<p>Six months ago Dr. Kruger appeared at a panel in Germany to present her theory that vaccination is causing aggressive tumors, and she asked for help from the doctors at that summit in collecting data. Unfortunately, few of them have been willing to collect that data and share it with her.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Autopsies</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"§autopsies\" class=\"header-anchor-widget\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<p>Part of Dr. Kruger’s time is spent on autopsies, and she drew attention to numerous concerning anomalies.</p>\n<ol>\nA 60-year-old had multiple malignant diseases. He got 2 doses of the Covid vaccine during chemotherapy and then developed Guillain Barre Syndrome. She found inflammation in the spinal cord, brain, and blood vessels.\nAn 80-yr-old woman became paralyzed one month after vaccination. Dr. Kruger found a hemorrhage in the spinal cord near the neck, which is something she’s never seen before. Under the microscope, she saw inflammation in the vessel that caused the rupture and caused bleeding. She also found inflammation in the heart muscles, which is myocarditis.\nDr. Kruger was called to settle a dispute between a family of a deceased person, and the doctors who signed the autopsy. The family and their physician believed the death was a result of the Covid vaccine, yet the ones who performed the autopsy didn’t come up with any findings to support that and did not link the death to the vaccine. When Dr. Kruger performed her own autopsy, she found evidence of myocarditis and vasculitis- inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs. The original autopsy either missed those signals or didn’t look for them, and the family was correct. Dr. Kruger shared her opinion, supported by another senior-level pathologist from Germany, that the death was indeed due to the Covid vaccine.\n</ol>\n<p>Dr. Kruger outlined 3 major issues with the way autopsies are currently being run in practice:</p>\n<ol>\nPatient information is sloppy. Dr. Kruger personally had several cases where clinicians had written that the patient was unvaccinated for the autopsy, when in fact in their medical files it was documented that they were vaccinated for Covid.\nThe typical autopsy doesn’t run exams deep enough to diagnose the root cause of certain medical issues. They don&#8217;t do rigorous histopathological testing of the tissues where vaccine damage would likely show up, but which is necessary to detect markers of vaccine-induced injury, such as immunological infiltrates or spike proteins in myocardial tissues. Dr. Kruger ran more thorough exams and found myocarditis and inflammations that were missed by the original autopsy.\nThere’s a lack of experience in evaluating these findings, and a lack of desire to properly contextualize cases. In addition, most autopsy clinicians don’t report cases to the FDA.\n</ol>\n<p>While Dr. Kruger’s testimony is by nature anecdotal, as a top-level pathologist of many years, her concerns should be taken very seriously and investigated further. Of course, that would require an honest regulation system which seems to be sorely lacking these days.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>“I’m Watching People Being Killed”</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<p>Dr. Kruger stated that she sees vaccination as a trigger for fast-growing tumors and autoimmune diseases. She’s seeing a lot of inflammation alongside tumors, and of course, it’s not only breast cancer. Many other pathologists have reported to Dr. Kruger that they’re seeing an elevation in cancers, cancers in multiple organs, and rare cancers.</p>\n<p>She ended off by saying “I studied medicine because I wanted to help people. But now it feels like I’m watching people being killed and there’s nothing I can do”.</p>\n<p>The first step to solving any issue is acknowledging there’s a problem. We have a huge problem, and in order to begin to resolve it, it must be acknowledged. It’s time to start pressuring doctors to speak out. Any doctor who’s aware enough to understand that something is off must begin to address the issue.

Dhillon told Brian Kilmeade, who was guest-hosting “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “It was bizarre. Frankly earlier today, you saw the allies of the administration, Sheldon Whitehouse say this would have been below the scope of Merrick Garland. That’s nonsense.

Where is his upset about how Hillary Clinton treated classified documents on her server?” Dhillon asked.</p>\r\n<p>“This is a ridiculous premise for an FBI swat team of 30 FBI agents to go through for nine hours,” Dhillon continued. “It just doesn’t add up.
