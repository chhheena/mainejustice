('20', '197', 'Maxims of Law', 'maxims-of-law', '<blockquote style=\"color: #000000; font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; font-size: medium; text-align: justify;\">\r\n<p>When Jesus spoke the Truth to his accusers, he would justify himself by quoting <b>Law</b>. First, he would quote God\'s Law, and after quoting God\'s Law He would often quote the accuser\'s law and use that against them as well.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p>For example, Jesus would say, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">\"Did ye never read in the <b>scriptures</b>...\"</span> and then <b>quote God\'s Law</b>. Then he would turn around and say, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">\"Is it not written in <b>your law</b>...\"</span> and <b>quote their own law</b>! His accusers would have no answer, they could not overcome Him. How could anyone overcome somebody who is obeying both God\'s Law and man\'s law!? If a man made law is just, it will be in harmony with God\'s Law.</p>\r\n<p>This is the purpose of this article. These maxims are the foundation and principles of the laws that man passes today. Unfortunately, men enforce their own will more than they enforce law. So, this is why, in addition to knowing God\'s Law, it is also important to know man\'s law, because man\'s law is based upon God\'s Law. And when you are accused of \"breaking the law,\" you can do what Jesus did, and use both God\'s Law and man\'s law to justify your lawful acts, for this is the only thing that will excuse you.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to distinguish between commercial law and maxims of law, when quoting from their law. We should never, ever quote their codes, rules, regulations, ordinances, statutes, common law, merchant law, public policies, constitutions, etc., because these are commercial in nature, and if we use their commercial law, they can presume we are engaged in commerce (which means we are of the world), which will nullify our witness (because we are not of the world). Maxims of law are not commercial law, but are mostly based upon scripture and truth.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a court case which demonstrates a typical example of the fruitlessness of describing oneself in the terms of the world, as distinguished from who and what our Heavenly Father has already told us we are.</p>\r\n<p>It was rendered by JOHN V. PARKER, Chief Judge:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Petitioner\'s shield of the \"<u>Common Law</u>\" as an \"Unenfranchised Sovereign Individual of the United States of America, a Republic,\" provides him with the same degreee of protection from federal income taxation as did the Ghost Dance of the Sioux warrior from the repeating rifles of the federal Calvary - ZERO.\" <i>599 F.Supp. 126, <u>George E. McKinney, Sr. v. Donald Regan</u>, Secretary of the Treasury, et al., Civ. A. No. 84-470-A., United States District Court, M.D. Louisiana, November 19, 1984.</i></blockquote>\r\n<p>Many insist on using the \"common law\" to defend themselves. The reason we should not is because, first and foremost, you do not see the term \"common law\" in scripture. Bondservants of Christ are only to use God\'s Law. Secondly, the common law is a commerical law today, created by merchants, influenced by Roman Law, and used for commercial purposes. The following definitions are taken from \"<i><u>A Dictionary of Law</u>, by William C. Anderson, 1893</i>.\"</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Custom of merchants:</b> A system of customs, originating among merchants, and allowed for the benefit of trade as part of the <u>common law</u>. <i>Page 303</i>.\r\n<p><b>Law-merchant; law of merchants:</b> The rules applicable to commercial paper were <u>transplanted into the common law</u> from the law merchant. They had their origin in the customs and course of business of merchants and bankers, and are now recognized by the courts because they are demanded by <u>the wants and conveniences</u> of the mercantile world. <i>Pages 670-671</i>.</p>\r\n<p><b>Roman Law:</b> The <u>common law</u> of England has been largely influenced by the Roman law, in several respects:…Through the development of <u>commercial law</u>. <i>Page 910</i>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>All of man\'s laws, except for many maxims of law, are commercial in nature.</p>\r\n<p>The following are the definitions of \"maxims,\" and then the relevant maxims of law will be listed.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><b>Maxim</b> (<i><u>Bouvier\'s Law Dictionary</u>, 1856</i>): An established principle or proposition. A principle of law universally admitted, as being just and consonant with reason.\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<blockquote>2. Maxims in law are somewhat like axioms in geometry. <i>1 Bl. Com. 68</i>. They are principles and authorities, and part of the general customs or common law of the land; and are of the same strength as acts of parliament, when the judges have determined what is a maxim; which belongs to the judges and not the jury. <i>Terms do Ley; Doct. &amp; Stud. Dial. 1, c. 8</i>. Maxims of the law are holden for law, and all other cases that may be applied to them shall be taken for granted. <i>1 Inst. 11. 67; 4 Rep. See 1 Com. c. 68; Plowd. 27, b.</i>\r\n<p>3. The application of the maxim to the case before the court, is generally the only difficulty. The true method of making the application is to ascertain how the maxim arose, and to consider whether the case to which it is applied is of the same character, or whether it is an exception to an apparently general rule.</p>\r\n<p>4. The alterations of any of the maxims of the common law are dangerous. <i>2 Inst. 210</i>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><b>Maxim</b> (William C. Anderson\'s <i><u>A Dictionary of Law</u></i>, (1893), page 666): So called…because it\'s value is the highest and its authority the most reliable, and because it is accepted by all persons at the very highest.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<blockquote>2. The principles and axioms of law, which are general propositions flowing from abstracted reason, and not accommodated to times or men, are wisely deposited in the breasts of the judges to be applied to such facts as come properly before them.\r\n<p>3. When a principle has been so long practiced and so universally acknowledged as to become a maxim, it is obligatory as part of the law.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><b>Maxim of Law</b> (<i><u>Black\'s Law Dictionary</u>, 3rd Edition, (1933), page 1171</i>): An established principle of proposition. A principle of law universally admitted as being a correct statement of the law, or as agreeable to reason. Coke defines a maxim to be \"a conclusion of reason\" <i>Coke on Littleton, 11a</i>. He says in another place, \"A maxim is a proposition to be of all men confessed and granted without proof, argument, or discourse.\" <i>Coke on Littleton. 67a.</i></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><b>Maxim</b> (<i><u>Black\'s Law Dictionary</u>, 4th Edition</i>): Maxims are but attempted general statements of rules of law and are law only to the extent of application in adjudicated cases.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>These maxims are taken directly from man\'s law dictionaries and court cases.

Among those currently hospitalized, 72 are in critical care and 31 are on ventilators.</p>\r\n<div> Prior to September, hospitalizations had not been above 200 since January. Now, the number has been above 200 for 21 of the last 22 days.</div>\r\n<p>“Our folks are fried. They are burned out,” said Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association. “A nurse friend said to me recently that what used to be a bad day is now every day.”</p>\r\n<p>New cases were not updated Friday because Thursday was a federal and state holiday, but recent trends suggest the pandemic could worsen with the holiday season approaching and more people gathering indoors. As of Thursday, Maine’s seven-day daily average stood at 553 cases, up from 462 cases two weeks earlier and 368 cases on average one month ago.</p>\r\n<p>“Maine CDC expects that those case counts will remain high,” Dr. Nirav Shah, the agency’s director, said this week. “For how long they remain high is fundamentally up to all of us.”</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 20px; font-family: Lusitana, serif; line-height: 34px; color: #222222;\"> <img src=\"data/phocadownload/images/maine-reports-all-time-high-covid-hospitalizations.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Since the pandemic reached Maine nearly 19 months ago, there have been 110,346 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 and 1,220 deaths, according to CDC data. Despite the recent surge, both metrics remain among the lowest per capita of any state.</p>\r\n<p>Across the United States, cases have started to inch up after declining steadily since mid-September. According to the U.S. CDC, the seven-day case average is about 74,500, compared with roughly 72,000 two weeks ago.</p>\r\n<p>Hospitalizations across the country are trending downward overall and averaging just under 40,000, compared with more than 60,000 a month ago, but some states, including Maine, have yet to see their numbers subside.</p>\r\n<p>Michaud said he worries about <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2021/11/11/state-reports-754-new-covid-19-cases-3-additional-deaths?rel=related\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how much worse things might get</a>. Last year, hospitals braced for a surge around the holidays, and it came, but that was during a time when universal masking and other safety measures were more widespread.</p>\r\n<p>“We could really be in for it this winter,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>One of the major challenges, Michaud said, will be effectively treating patients for injuries or illnesses unrelated to the pandemic. In addition to new patients being admitted, hospitals are struggling to discharge other patients into nursing homes or other facilities because of staffing shortages.</p>\r\n<p>“I keep saying, somewhat flippantly, you better hope you don’t need a hip replacement because you’re not going to get it for a while,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Several hospitals hit record levels of COVID-19 inpatients this week, including Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, MaineGeneral in Augusta and Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital in Ellsworth.</p>\r\n<p>At MaineHealth, the parent organization of Maine Medical Center and seven other hospitals in the state, there were 78 people hospitalized with COVID-19 on Friday, which spokesman John Porter referred to as “a big number for us.” Of those, 30 are in critical care (22 unvaccinated) and 12 are on ventilators (11 unvaccinated).</p>\r\n<p>‘A VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION’</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer at MaineHealth, agreed that it’s especially disconcerting because experts don’t necessarily know what things might look like in the weeks ahead.</p>\r\n<p>“Influenza has been around for hundreds of years, and we still can’t always predict that. With COVID, we can predict it even less,” she said. “I can’t emphasize strongly enough to the public what a very challenging situation we’re in.”</p>\r\n<p>Vaccinations, meanwhile, continue at a steady pace, including among 5- to 11-year-olds, who are now eligible. The daily rate of vaccine doses has doubled over the past month, and the state has now administered 948,623 vaccines, which represents 70.6 percent of all Mainers. In less than a week, 6,774 elementary school-age children have gotten their first doses of vaccine, with 58 percent coming from Cumberland and York counties.</p>\r\n<p>Although Maine’s overall vaccination rate is among the best of any state – the top five states for vaccinations are all in New England – it’s not uniform across counties, and that disparity is what has been driving transmission of late, Shah said this week. Many rural parts of the state have barely reached a vaccination rate of 60 percent, which means large pockets of people remain unvaccinated, giving the virus room to spread. Across the state, there are still nearly 400,000 people who are not yet fully vaccinated.</p>\r\n<p>Over the past 28 days, according to CDC data, the lowest rate of virus transmission has been in Cumberland County, which has the highest vaccination rate. By comparison, the two counties with the highest rates of transmission during that time – Somerset and Franklin – have the second- and third-lowest vaccination rates, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>Shah said he understands people may be confused and disheartened by the recent surge in Maine, but he reiterated that vaccines remain the best path out of the pandemic, and he again encouraged anyone who has yet to get vaccinated to consider doing so.</p>\r\n<p>“None of this is to undermine or undercut the fact that the vaccines and vaccinations continue to work,” he said. “If you’re vaccinated, your risk of getting severely ill from COVID or ending up in a hospital or dying remain low.”</p>\r\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2021/11/12/maine-sets-new-pandemic-high-for-covid-19-hospitalizations\">https://www.pressherald.com/2021/11/12/maine-sets-new-pandemic-high-for-covid-19-hospitalizations</a> </p>', '1', '107', '2021-11-09 11:54:17', '82', '', '2021-11-14 06:29:44', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-11-09 11:54:17', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/11\\/14\\/Hospitalizations-CDC-1635178831.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '7', '26', '', '', '1', '79', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

It should have been initiated years ago to have any substantive impact as deadlines for compliance near for many workers.</p>\r\n<p>Even if Florida legislators agree to ditch OSHA, the process “could take several years,” a report on the situation warns. This will not help Florida businesses avoid OSHA fines beginning Jan. 4, 2022, which is the current deadline.</p>\r\n<p>After that, non-compliant businesses that refuse to obey Pedo Joe’s demands face fines of up to $136,532.</p>\r\n<p>“State lawmakers will also discuss proposals to prevent government employees to be forced to vaccinate, requiring businesses to allow vaccine exemptions, and prohibiting the Florida surgeon general from forcing citizens to get vaccinated,” reported Zero Hedge about how Florida congressmen are trying to get ahead of all this, likely in vain.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Florida continues to <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-14-florida-covid-cases-plunged-88percent-no-mandates.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">set records</a> in the decline of the coronavirus throughout the state.</p>\r\n<p>The latest data shows that new “cases” of the Chinese virus plummeted by 88 percent after all of the mandates – including those for wearing a mask – were lifted through executive orders.</p>\r\n<p>Compared to other states where restrictions are still in place and vaccine compliance is high, Florida is faring better than almost all of them as it leads the pack in getting back to “normal.”</p>\r\n<p>“Secede: it’s the only answer,” wrote one Zero Hedge commenter about what he believes is Florida’s only option to escape all the federal tyranny. “Sad but true.”</p>\r\n<p>Another suggested that other states should, and could, follow Florida if it moved in the direction of secession.</p>\r\n<p>“That won’t take years,” this person wrote about seceding. “All it takes is someone like the Florida governor to say the emperor has no clothes and to pound sand.”</p>\r\n<p>Another pointed out that anything coming from the illegitimate Biden regime is “completely illegal and unconstitutional” to begin with.

This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>', '0', '86', '2022-07-22 11:05:55', '801', '', '2022-07-22 11:05:55', '801', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-07-22 11:05:55', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2017\\/06\\/07\\/Newskit-images_0009_pexels-photo-342361.jpg\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '6', '9', '', '', '1', '0', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', '*', '', '');/**ABDB**/

Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney\'s fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury. Attn: Chief Legal Officer 3924 W River Rd Sidney, Maine 04330 legal@qsentus.com</p>\r\n<p>13.

The entire state has not seen more than 50 new cases of COVID-19 per day for the last two months.  \nFollowing the October 20 report, a government official in Uttar Pradesh said, “Despite aggressive tracing and testing, UP’s positivity rate which shows the level of infections in the people, has been registering a steady decline for several days indicating that Covid is receding from the state.”\n India.com is reporting that the state of Uttar Pradesh, at the order of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, is requiring any visitors to be tested for COVID-19 prior to entry. This decision is due to the rising rates in cases in surrounding states and countries, which boast a much higher vaccination rate than Uttar Pradesh.\n \nAs of October 28, there were only 13 new COVID-19 cases reported throughout eight districts.\n \nAdityanath had implemented “surveillance committees” to assist with fighting the virus.

The use of intelligence agencies to trace the origins is in itself an iron-clad proof of politicization.”</p>\n<p>He claimed that more than 80 countries have opposed the politicization of origins-tracing. “However, the US remains obsessed with political manipulation and intelligence-led origins-tracing in disregard of international justice.”</p>\n<p>Wang called on Washington to “stop all scapegoating and blame-shifting” and instead “create enabling conditions for scientists all over the world to conduct origins-tracing cooperation.”</p>\n<p><strong>What did the latest US report conclude?</strong></p>\n<p>The declassified paper, published Friday, said a natural origin and a lab leak are both plausible hypotheses.

There are almost 9,000 Britons hospitalized with <a class=\"\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/\">Covid-19</a> — the highest level since March, when the United Kingdom was in the midst of a long national lockdown.</p>\n<p>Unlike the rises and falls of previous periods of infection, the most recent wave shows the positive impact of Britain’s vaccination rollout: Far fewer Covid hospital admissions and deaths have followed the rise in cases than in previous waves. Still, health experts contend that the ongoing hospitalizations and deaths are burdening overstretched hospitals and could be reduced with basic measures.</p>\n<p>Tim Spector, a professor at King’s College London, who has been leading a major study of Covid symptoms since the start of the pandemic, said it is hard to predict whether high levels of transmission will continue. One reason for the uncertainty, he said, is that public behavior, led by government guidance, is very different now than in previous surges. “In past waves, there’s been a general panic and reduction in mobility,” he said.</p>\n<p>“The trouble is that the government has gone from ‘operation fear’ that we had a year ago to ‘operation complacency,’” Spector said. “It’s a massive switch.”</p>\n<p><a class=\"\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/uk-coronavirus-tracker-region-wise-cases-and-deaths-6373786/\">England</a> has some of the loosest coronavirus protections in Europe since July 19, when it lifted all legal restrictions, including mandatory mask-wearing. In a recent survey by YouGov and Imperial College London, 21% of Britons said they rarely or never wear a face mask in public — about four times as many as in Italy and Spain.</p>\n<p>Despite the extended surge in cases, the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies recently said that behaviors in Britain are closer to pre-pandemic levels than at any time since March 2020.</p>\n<p>The current surge is being primarily driven by high levels of infection in school-age children, with more than one-third of all recent cases being reported in those younger than 15.</p>\n<p>Unlike most of Europe, the UK was slow to approve vaccines for adolescents. The recommendation of a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds was not announced until mid-September — weeks after many students had returned to school from summer vacation. So far, just 21% of 12- to 15-year-olds are vaccinated in England, compared with 80% of adults.</p>\n<p>Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London, said the lag in approval of vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds was an enormous mistake.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had an extra 10% or 20% of kids infected when they didn’t need to be, and we’re dealing with the hospitalizations and deaths that came from that,” Pagel said. “And with long Covid, even if that affects 5% of them, that’s a lot of kids.”</p>\n<p>These infections have started to spread into older age groups in recent weeks, and overall in England, about 20% of beds in intensive care units are filled with Covid patients. Experts warn that the National Health Service could face intense pressure this winter.</p>\n<p>Experts agree that Covid vaccine booster doses — an additional shot given once the protection from the initial inoculation starts to decline — are going to be essential to reduce demand on hospitals in the coming months. A recent study from Public Health England found that protection against symptomatic infection drops significantly in the five months after a second vaccine dose.</p>\n<p>The study found the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s effectiveness at preventing symptomatic infection from the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/covid-delta-variant-coronavirus-cases-7344758/\">delta variant</a> dropped to 70% after five months from 90% two weeks after full immunization. Waning immunity was more severe for those who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine; five months after being administered, its effectiveness dropped to 47% from 67%.</p>\n<p>Booster doses are currently being rolled out to everyone ages 50 and above in Britain, as well as health care workers and the clinically vulnerable, six months after their second doses. So far, 6.7 million booster doses, or enough to cover 10% of the total population, have been administered.</p>\n<p>The UK’s high case rates had been an outlier in Western Europe in recent weeks, as infections in France, Germany and Spain all plateaued at low levels. But rising cases in Germany hint that Britain’s woes could spread across the continent this winter, with fears that waning immunity and increased indoor mixing will fuel further infection.</p>\n<p>The British government has so far resisted calls to invoke its “Plan B” for suppressing infections over the winter. That protocol would include vaccine passes for nightclubs, mandatory face coverings and a push for those who can to work from home.</p>\n<p>At a recent news conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said although the NHS is under increasing pressure, he believed the current lack of restrictions remained appropriate. “If we feel at any point it’s becoming unsustainable, then we won’t hesitate to act,” he added.</p>\n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association, in a recent statement pressed for more urgent action. He said the NHS is heading into winter with a “depleted and exhausted workforce” and called on the government to enact its “Plan B” measures now to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Case rates have fallen in the UK in the past few days, although it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue once children return to school next week after a midsemester break.

However, using the above definition, common sense, the laws of logic and the dictates of science, any unbiased person must come to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has <i>never</i> been isolated or purified. As a result, no confirmation of the virus’ existence can be found. The logical, common sense, and scientific consequences of this fact are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the structure and composition of something not shown to exist can’t be known, including the presence, structure, and function of any hypothetical spike or other proteins;</li>\r\n<li>the genetic sequence of something that has never been found can’t be known;</li>\r\n<li>“variants” of something that hasn’t been shown to exist can’t be known;</li>\r\n<li>it’s impossible to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease called Covid-19.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In as concise terms as possible, here’s the proper way to isolate, characterize and demonstrate a new virus. First, one takes samples (blood, sputum, secretions) from many people (e.g. 500) with symptoms which are unique and specific enough to characterize an illness. Without mixing these samples with ANY tissue or products that also contain genetic material, the virologist macerates, filters and ultracentrifuges i.e. <i>purifies</i> the specimen. This common virology technique, done for decades to isolate bacteriophages<sup>1</sup> and so-called giant viruses in every virology lab, then allows the virologist to demonstrate with electron microscopy thousands of identically sized and shaped particles. These particles are the isolated and purified virus.</p>\r\n<p>These identical particles are then checked for uniformity by physical and/or microscopic techniques. Once the purity is determined, the particles may be further characterized. This would include examining the structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the particles. Next, their genetic makeup is characterized by extracting the genetic material directly from the purified particles and using genetic-sequencing techniques, such as Sanger sequencing, that have also been around for decades. Then one does an analysis to confirm that these uniform particles are exogenous (outside) in origin as a virus is conceptualized to be, and not the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues.<sup>2</sup> (As of May 2020, we know that virologists have no way to determine whether the particles they’re seeing are viruses or just normal break-down products of dead and dying tissues.)<sup>3</sup> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1e8edf5 ob-harakiri-inherit elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1e8edf5\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;_ob_harakiri_writing_mode&quot;:&quot;inherit&quot;,&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\r\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\r\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\r\n<p><em><sup>1</sup> Isolation, characterization and analysis of bacteriophages from the haloalkaline lake Elmenteita, KenyaJuliah Khayeli Akhwale et al, PLOS One, Published: April 25, 2019. <a title=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215734\" href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215734\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215734</a> — accessed 2/15/21</em><br /><em><sup>2</sup> “Extracellular Vesicles Derived From Apoptotic Cells: An Essential Link Between Death and Regeneration,” Maojiao Li1 et al, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2020 October 2. <a title=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.573511/full\" href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.573511/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.573511/full</a> — accessed 2/15/21</em><br /><em><sup>3</sup> “The Role of Extracellular Vesicles as Allies of HIV, HCV and SARS Viruses,” Flavia Giannessi, et al, Viruses, 2020 May</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c0ceae5 elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"c0ceae5\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">If we have come this far then we have fully isolated, characterized, and genetically sequenced an exogenous virus particle. However, we still have to show it is causally related to a disease. This is carried out by exposing a group of healthy subjects (animals are usually used) to this isolated, purified virus in the manner in which the disease is thought to be transmitted. If the animals get sick with the same disease, as confirmed by clinical and autopsy findings, one has now shown that the virus actually causes a disease. This demonstrates infectivity and transmission of an infectious agent.</div>\r\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0f796f5 ob-harakiri-inherit elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"0f796f5\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;_ob_harakiri_writing_mode&quot;:&quot;inherit&quot;,&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\r\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\r\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\r\n<p>None of these steps has even been attempted with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, nor have all these steps been successfully performed for any so-called pathogenic virus. Our research indicates that a single study showing these steps does not exist in the medical literature.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, since 1954, virologists have taken unpurified samples from a relatively few people, often less than ten, with a similar disease. They then minimally process this sample and inoculate this unpurified sample onto tissue culture containing usually four to six other types of material — <strong>all of which contain identical genetic material as to what is called a “virus.”</strong> The tissue culture is starved and poisoned and naturally disintegrates into many types of particles, some of which contain genetic material. Against all common sense, logic, use of the English language and scientific integrity, this process is called “virus isolation.” This brew containing fragments of genetic material from many sources is then subjected to genetic analysis, which then creates in a computer-simulation process the alleged sequence of the alleged virus, a so called <em>in silico genome</em>. At no time is an actual virus confirmed by electron microscopy. At no time is a genome extracted and sequenced from an actual virus. This is scientific fraud.</p>\r\n<p>The observation that the unpurified specimen — inoculated onto tissue culture along with toxic antibiotics, bovine fetal tissue, amniotic fluid and other tissues — destroys the kidney tissue onto which it is inoculated is given as evidence of the virus’ existence and pathogenicity. This is scientific fraud.</p>\r\n<p>From now on, when anyone gives you a paper that suggests the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated, please check the methods sections. If the researchers used Vero cells or any other culture method, you know that their process was not isolation. You will hear the following excuses for why actual isolation isn’t done:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There were not enough virus particles found in samples from patients to analyze.</li>\r\n<li>Viruses are intracellular parasites; they can’t be found outside the cell in this manner.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>If No. 1 is correct, and we can’t find the virus in the sputum of sick people, then on what evidence do we think the virus is dangerous or even lethal? If No. 2 is correct, then how is the virus spread from person to person? We are told it emerges from the cell to infect others. Then why isn’t it possible to find it?</p>\r\n<p>Finally, questioning these virology techniques and conclusions is not some distraction or divisive issue. Shining the light on this truth is essential to stop this terrible fraud that humanity is confronting. For, as we now know, if the virus has never been isolated, sequenced or shown to cause illness, if the virus is imaginary, then why are we wearing masks, social distancing and putting the whole world into prison?</p>\r\n<p>Finally, if pathogenic viruses don’t exist, then what is going into those injectable devices erroneously called “vaccines,” and what is their purpose? This scientific question is the most urgent and relevant one of our time.</p>\r\n<p>We are correct. The SARS-CoV2 virus does not exist.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-76a3116 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\"
