width=\"899\" height=\"574\"></p>\n<p>by <strong>Brian Shilhavy</strong><br>\n<strong>Editor, Health Impact News</strong></p>\n<p>With millions of medical professionals in the United States that have either been fired for not complying to medical mandates such as COVID-19 vaccines, or have been fired for exposing corruption in hospitals that have', 'been literally murdering people with COVID protocols the past couple of years, or who have just simply quit because they could no longer in good conscience participate in a system that is killing people, are starting a new medical paradigm: Private member medical associations.</p>\n<p>These kinds of private member medical associations are not new, of course, and many have existed prior to the COVID-19 Scam, but they have a common goal: eliminate the insurance companies who decide who gets to be treated and who does not, and eliminate the federal government with their massive public funding for only &#8220;approved&#8221; therapies.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the American public has been brainwashed for decades now into believing that one cannot survive without health insurance, or the government-funded and supported medical system.</p>\n<p>But I can testify to the fact that it is possible, as I have not paid for health insurance for myself and my family for over 30 years, and we are all still alive, and none of us are bankrupt due to medical bills.</p>\n<p>I learned early on in my life to NOT trust in doctors and hospitals for my health, but to trust in God, and God has honored my faith in him for over 30 years now since I stopped paying for health insurance. Much of my writing the past decade and a half has been exposing how evil and corrupt the medical system is, and how it is idolatry to trust in it for your health.

While the article at The Epoch Times is behind a paywall, you can <a href=\"https://ncphysiciansforfreedom.com/2022/08/14/nurses-who-left-the-health-care-system-to-focus-on-early-treatment-describe-brutal-covid-19-treatment-protocols/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">read the article also on the <em>North Carolina Physicians for Freedom </em>website.</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nurses who witnessed “brutal” hospital <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-covid-19\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">COVID-19</a> treatment protocols kill patients paint a bleak picture of what is taking place in state and federally funded health care systems.</p>\n<p>“They’re horrific, and they’re all in lockstep,” Staci Kay, a nurse practitioner with the <a href=\"https://ncphysiciansforfreedom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">North Carolina Physicians for Freedom</a> who left the hospital system to start her own early treatment private practice, told The Epoch Times. “They will not consider protocols outside of what’s given to them by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the NIH (National Institute of Health). And nobody is asking why.”</p>\n<p>Fueled by cognitive dissonance amid an array of red flags, Kay said hospital staff is ignoring blatantly problematic treatments that performed poorly in clinical trials, such as remdesivir, and protocols such as keeping the patient isolated, just to adhere to the federal canon.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen people die with their family watching via iPad on Facetime,” Kay said. “It was brutal.”</p>\n<p>As a former nurse in intensive care, Kay said she had seen her share of tragedy, but how she saw COVID patients being treated “had me waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat with chest pains.”</p>\n<p>“I hated my job,” Kay said. “I hated going to work. I was stressed in a way I’ve never been before in my entire life.”</p>\n<p>Keeping families isolated was especially difficult, she said, because people couldn’t come to say goodbye to their loved ones.</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">‘We Can Do Better’</h3>\n<p>Kay was looking for other options when she found an inpatient protocol designed Dr. Paul Marik, founding member of Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, which purported to have a 94 percent success rate.</p>\n<p>However, after Kay pitched it to the head of the pulmonary critical care department, she was dismissed, and the physician boasted that the hospital had a 66 percent survival rate at the time.</p>\n<p>“I told him, ‘I feel like we can do better,’ but I was very quickly shut down,” Kay said. “I became very angry because I’m watching people die and I knew we could have been doing better.”</p>\n<p>It was as if formerly smart people had become brainwashed, “and then just dumb,” Kay said, lacking the mental wherewithal to discern true from false.</p>\n<p>This led Kay to begin treating patients in the outpatient setting to prevent their admission into the hospital system, which is now her full-time job after being fired for not submitting to what she described as illogical testing requirements for those who weren’t vaccinated.</p>\n<p>At her telemedicine business, Kay said she’s seeing multiple cases of people suffering from COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-vaccine-injuries\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">vaccine injuries</a>.</p>\n<p>“I saw things on the inpatient side, too, that I suspected were vaccine injuries that went unacknowledged by our physicians,” Kay said. “I saw brain bleeds, seizures out of nowhere, cancer that just spread like wildfire, ischemic strokes, and I saw one person die horrifically from myocarditis.”</p>\n<p>On the outpatient side, she said she’s seen conditions resulting from the COVID-19 vaccine such as brain fog, cognitive decline, joint pain, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and neuropathy, which is numbness and tingling in hands, feet, and extremities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">‘The Old School Becomes The New School’</h3>\n<p>Kay’s business, Sophelina Counseling, provides telemedicine, mobile urgent care, and mobile IV therapies. It’s independent of corporate, federal, and state control, which she said is a solution to a health care system paralyzed with oppressive requirements.</p>\n<p>“As long as there’s corporate control over medicine, whether it’s Medicare or private insurance companies, you’re always going to have providers who are forced, pressured, and coerced to do things that they wouldn’t normally do,” she said. “Physicians don’t have the treatment they used to have.”</p>\n<p>Because of this corporate control, Kay said the list of boxes they must check takes time away from the actual patient.</p>\n<p>“Getting away from this corporate structure is going to be a game changer,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kay advocated for returning to the “old school” way, which is the direct, primary care model, in which the patient pays a monthly or annual fee to have access to the provider without the interference of a traditional insurance company that requires “too many hoops to jump through, headaches, and checkboxes.”</p>\n<p>Kay points to a health care model called GoldCare, designed by Dr. Simone Gold, founder of America’s Frontline Doctors.</p>\n<p>Gold, who was sentenced to two months in prison for her alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 breach of the Capitol, created GoldCare as a private membership association (PMA).</p>\n<p>Because much of what insurance companies do revolves around potential lawsuits, to be a member of the PMA, one must sign a clause, agreeing that they won’t sue.</p>\n<p>“What that does for us is we don’t have to order unnecessary testing or consults just to cover our back end because that’s most of what corporate medicine does,” she said.</p>\n<p>As a result, Kay said, both the patient and the physician are happier because the treatment process hasn’t been weighted down with bloated insurance requirements.</p>\n<p>For Kay, this model—an evocation of a simpler time in medical care when doctors were more connected with their patients—is key.</p>\n<p>“The old school is going to have to become the new school,” Kay said.</p>\n<p>NIH and the CDC did not respond to The Epoch Times’ request for comment on COVID-19 treatment protocols.

There were more anticoagulant drugs and routes of administration that could have been utilized. Intravenous heparin is reversible. If they were willing to withdraw life support, why were they not willing to try something that could clear a circulatory impairment?”</p>\n<p>In the end, the hospital won, she said.</p>\n<p>“The mother died gasping for air while my hand was on her back,” she said. “I couldn’t believe it. I went to my manager and asked for an audit to be done on our coagulation times and pulmonary embolism treatment protocols. That got me booted from the ICU until I was fired.”</p>\n<p>The nurse said she observed administrators repeatedly promoting the safety of the vaccine, though these claims weren’t reflecting what they were seeing with the growing cases of vaccine injuries.</p>\n<p>Though there was some staff who saw the truth but ignored it to keep their jobs, there were many whom she observed—just as Kay reported—who exhibited “mind-blowing cognitive dissonance.”</p>\n<p>“They received the vaccines themselves, and if they were to ever confront the possibility that they willingly became the hands of a truly evil agenda, I don’t think they could live with themselves,” the nurse said. “I used to consider my co-workers as people with whom I’d trust my life, but after they got that second dose of the vaccine, it was like they had a hive mind bent on hatred. It’s very eerie to say that out loud.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read the full article at <a

(Official White House photo by Cameron Smith)</figure>\n<p>The Democrats and other leftists in America during the Joe Biden administration have adopted a &#8220;double standard&#8221; of using laws against President Trump that they never enforced against their political allies, like Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the opinion of Alan Dershowitz, the Felix Frankfurter professor of law emeritus at Harvard and a longtime, well-known liberal commentator on legal issues, expressed in a column at the <a href=\"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/18809/trump-double-standard\">Gatestone Institute.</a></p>\n<p>In fact, he said, &#8220;Those of us who — despite our opposition to Trump politically — insist that the same standards of civil liberties must be applied to him as to those we support politically, have lost friends, been defamed by the media and been cancelled.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He continued, &#8220;This unacceptable double standard is so widespread that it endangers the rule of law and the historic role of neutral, non-partisan civil liberties that protect it from partisan weaponization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How have the leftists warped the standards to attack Trump? Multiple ways, he explained.</p>\n<p>Most recently are the allegations created by the Biden Department of Justice regarding the Espionage Act of 1917 against Trump, which was the basis for an FBI raid of Trump&#8217;s home.</p>\n<p>Trump supporters have bluntly stated it was a fishing trip hunting for anything that could be used to discourage Trump from running for office in 2024, as he&#8217;s the leading GOP candidate for president even before announcing.</p>\n<p>Democrats already have staged two failed attempts at impeaching him and removing him from office, and also have a Democrat-run House committee investigating Jan. 6, which so far has failed to alter the political landscape in America.</p>\n<p>Dershowitz explained, &#8220;In the past, many leftist civil libertarians have railed against the breadth and scope of this [Espionage] law, calling it repressive and unconstitutionally vague. Among the people who were prosecuted, indicted or investigated under the Espionage Act are progressive icons such as socialists Eugene V. Debs and Charles Schenk, antiwar activists Daniel Ellsberg and Dr. Benjamin Spock, whistleblowers Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning, anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, as well as many others who made unpopular speeches, engaged in protests or took other actions deemed unpatriotic by the government.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But, he said, now the &#8220;shoe is on the other foot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now that the same law is being deployed against a possible presidential candidate they deplore — many of these same leftists are demanding that this accordion-like law be expanded to fit Trump&#8217;s alleged mishandling of classified material. The ACLU, which has repeatedly challenged the constitutionality and applicability of the Espionage Act to anti-government activities by left-wing radicals, is strangely silent when the same overbroad law is deployed against a political figure whose politics they deplore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Dershowitz explained the &#8220;same double standard&#8221; was evident during the FBI&#8217;s search of Trump&#8217;s home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many civil libertarians have complained about the overuse of search warrants in situations where a &#8216;less intrusive&#8217; and narrower subpoena would suffice. Even U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged that the policy of the Justice Department is to use measures less intrusive than a full-blown search whenever possible. Yet he did not explain why a day-long search of Trump&#8217;s home was necessary, especially since a subpoena had been issued and could have been judicially enforced if the government was dissatisfied with the progress of negotiations. Again, silence from the ACLU and other left-wing civil libertarians.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And, he said, it&#8217;s not just Trump in the cross-hairs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then there is the manner by which Trump loyalists have been treated when they were indicted. Several have been arrested, handcuffed and shackled, despite not having been charged with crimes of violence and despite the absence of evidence that they were planning to flee. In my long experience, most other comparable defendants are simply notified of the charges and ordered to appear in court. Yet despite this apparent double standard, the left has been silent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He suggested Garland&#8217;s standard now suggests, &#8220;Due process for me but not for thee.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Perhaps the most glaring manifestation of the double standard currently at work is the different approach taken to the alleged mishandling of classified material by Trump, on the one hand, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, on the other hand. No wide-ranging search warrants were sought for Clinton&#8217;s home, where private servers were apparently kept and subpoenaed material even possibly destroyed,&#8221; he pointed out.</p>\n<p>There never have been any prosecutions for that &#8220;comparable mishandling&#8221; of classified information.</p>\n<p>The idea of &#8220;one standard of civil liberties&#8221; appears to have gone missing &#8220;from recent attempts to &#8216;get&#8217; Trump and his loyalists,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Documents that, for example, we legitimately would not want the Chinese government to see.</p>\n<div id=\"IC3-ad\" class=\"sponsor IC3\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"IC3\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&#8220;If that is true, would it justify what happened?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Would it justify sending a large team of federal agents to shut down the entire southern tip of Palm Beach to raid Mar-a-Lago on a weekday?&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/tucker-carlson-doj-complicit-covering-hunter-biden/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carlson</a> pretty much answered this when he said &#8220;one of the laws they&#8217;re telling you that Trump broke doesn&#8217;t even have criminal penalties attached to it because it&#8217;s not serious enough.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"in-article-related\" class=\"in-article-more inner-content\">\n<div class=\"in-article-more-label\">Related:</div>\n<div class=\"in-article-more-right\">\n<a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/tucker-carlson-george-soros-actively-subverting-rule-law-united-states/\" data-type=\"Internal link\" data-type-location=\"in-content-related\">Tucker Carlson: George Soros Is Actively Subverting the Rule of Law in the United States</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&#8220;Federal paramilitaries don&#8217;t show up at your house when you violate the Presidential Records Act,&#8221; Carlson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And in fact, as we later learned, the actual warrant for the raid, which was signed by an openly partisan judge who &#8212; because you couldn&#8217;t make any of this up if you tried &#8212; once represented Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s side in the famous underage sex case &#8230; that judge allowed the FBI to seize virtually every piece of paper in Donald Trump&#8217;s house, whether or not it had ever been classified.&#8221;</p>\n<div id=\"IC4-ad\" class=\"sponsor IC4\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"IC4\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"firefly-embed\">\n<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n<p>But then there was the second explanation for the raid &#8212; not only were the documents classified, they involved nuclear secrets. As Carlson pointed out, &#8220;that revised story line was leaked anonymously to an obedient press corps, which, as you just saw, repeated every word like it was verifiable fact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once again, no one even bothered to explain what these nuclear secrets might be. What&#8217;s a nuclear secret exactly, and what did Trump plan to do with them? Did he plan to defect to Moscow, give the launch codes to Vladimir Putin, start his own rogue state in the Bahamas?&#8221; Carlson said.</p>\n<p>But, of course, we couldn&#8217;t be shown the documents &#8212; or even get any sort of inkling as to what was in them &#8212; because to do so would jeopardize national security. We just had to let them vouch for it.</p>\n<div id=\"REP_0-ad\" class=\"sponsor REP\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"REP_0\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Except, of course, if the <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/grassley-exposes-fbi-double-standards-trump-raid-demands-immediate-transparency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nuclear secrets</a> were that dangerous, why had the feds waited so long to act?</p>\n<p>&#8220;If the Biden administration really believed that, if they really thought Donald Trump possessed documents that posed an imminent danger to American national security, then you have to wonder, why did they wait a year and a half to do anything about it? Why did they wait till 90 days before a midterm election, an election that polls suggest they will lose?&#8221; Carlson said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make &#8212; oh, wait, actually, it does make sense.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In fact, the question answers itself. Despite superficial appearances, the raid of Mar-a-Lago was not an act of law enforcement. It was the opposite of that. It was an attack on the rule of law. It was a power grab,&#8221; he continued.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The same week the Biden White House announced that Joe Biden will definitely seek a second term as president, the same week, the Biden Justice Department launched an armed raid against Biden&#8217;s main rival in that same presidential election. That&#8217;s what happened. Pause for a minute. If The New York Times told you that something like that was going on in Chad or the Gambia, what would your reaction be?</p>\n<div id=\"REP_1-ad\" class=\"sponsor REP\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"REP_1\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d probably say to yourself, &#8216;Thank God I don&#8217;t live in a place like that, a country where politicians used armed men to cling to power,\'&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Oh, but you do live in a country like that. You do. The evidence is all around us. We just don&#8217;t want to see it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is, perhaps, the one thing Carlson missed during his extended Monday monologue. While one appreciates the sentiment, if I heard the former Gambian president had his home raided at the behest of the current Gambian president, I&#8217;d react as if it were business as usual. When I heard the FBI had raided the home of one of our former presidents at the behest of our current, my thought was that it was business as usual &#8212; just so long as it wasn&#8217;t the home of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Barack Obama.</p>\n<p>This June 16 marked the seventh anniversary of the Great Trump Hunt. The moment our future president came down the elevator, the investigations began. Alfa Bank. Carter Page. The Steele dossier. <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/judge-hands-big-win-gen-flynn-will-allow-family-sue-cnn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Flynn</a>. The &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/secret-recording-reignites-democrat-crusade-find-pee-tapes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pee tape</a>.&#8221; The James Comey firing.

The &#8220;quid pro quo&#8221; with Ukraine. The list goes on.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much substantive wrongdoing any investigation into these pseudo-scandals found. Usually, they turned up a big, fat goose egg &#8212; but that didn&#8217;t stop them from happening, over and over again. Every time, Democrats and their enablers in the liberal media assured us <em>something</em> was going to happen this time around. Just you wait!</p>\n<div id=\"REP_2-ad\" class=\"sponsor REP\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"REP_2\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Only a fool could believe the raid was a &#8220;legitimate act of law enforcement&#8221; and will end in charges, given the history of these Trump-centric investigations. Sure, raiding Mar-a-Lago may have upped the ante a bit, but you&#8217;ve got to make a pretty big splash these days to get our attention regarding Trump. At least they managed that.</p>\n<p>And, while this likely won&#8217;t end with the former president in a criminal court, only a fool could believe that Biden&#8217;s Department of Justice will make that official before the midterms.

(Official White House photo by Shealah Craighead)</figure>\n<p>President Donald Trump is demanding the Joe Biden administration release – without censoring – the affidavit used by the FBI to stage a raid on Trump&#8217;s Florida home, a raid during which a report already has confirmed agents stole Trump&#8217;s passports.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no way to justify the unannounced RAID of Mar-a-Lago, the home of the 45th President of the United States (who got more votes, by far, than any sitting President in the history of our Country!), by a very large number of gun toting FBI Agents, and the Department of &#8216;Justice,\'&#8221; Trump said on social media. &#8220;But, in the interest of TRANSPARENCY, I call for the immediate release of the completely Unredacted Affidavit pertaining to this horrible and shocking BREAK-IN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The FBI staged its raid when Trump was not at his home, allegedly in pursuit of presidential documents.</p>\n<p>This is in direct conflict with the standards used by the federal government for other presidents, especially since Trump already was cooperating with the Washington bureaucracy as the documents from his first tenure in the White House were being sorted out.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-demands-completely-unredacted-fbi-affidavit-florida-raid\">Washington Examiner</a> said while the search warrant was released, he wants the public to have access to the underlying &#8220;affidavit&#8221; created by the FBI or DOJ.</p>\n<p>And he called for Judge Bruce Reinhart, who is overseeing the case, to be recused.</p>\n<p>The DOJ is arguing in court that it wants to keep its claims concealed from Trump and the public.</p>\n<p>The filing from the Biden administration claimed the document is a &#8220;roadmap&#8221; to the &#8220;ongoing investigation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The government claimed its release would &#8220;compromise&#8221; its &#8220;investigative steps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fact that this investigation implicates highly classified materials further underscores the need to protect the integrity of the investigation and exacerbates the potential for harm if information is disclosed to the public prematurely or improperly,&#8221; the government claimed.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-mar-lago-affidavit-release-denounces-fbi-raid-no-way-justify\">Fox News,</a> Trump&#8217;s call for public access to government information came after the DOJ demanded in court that the details be withheld.</p>\n<p>Trump has asserted that the search and seizure by the Democrat-run DOJ are just part of a political plot to prevent him from running for president in 2024, for which he already is the leading GOP candidate.</p>\n<p>Democrats already have provided ample evidence for just that contention, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s two failed attempts at impeaching and removing Trump – once after he already had finished his term.</p>\n<p>Then there is the partisan Jan. 6 committee that has been &#8220;investigating&#8221; the Jan. 6 riot, but has allowed only evidence against President Trump, not any statements that would defend him.</p>\n<p>Nor has it attempted such basic interviews such as asking Pelosi, whose responsibilities include the security of the Capitol, why she rejected President Trump&#8217;s suggestions for extra security that day.</p>\n<p>Many of the Democrats&#8217; schemes against Trump appear to be intended to prevent him from running for office again, and they have claimed any violation of procedure involving presidential documents could provide those grounds.</p>\n<p>However, constitutional experts point out that the qualifications to run for president are specified in the Constitution, which does not provide an option to disqualify someone for making a paperwork mistake.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

contract has been adopted in Minneapolis that builds &#8220;racism&#8221; into the process, allowing the district to fire, during cutbacks, white teachers with more seniority and retain minorities with lower seniority.</p>\n<p>Alpha News confirmed the contract specifies that minority teachers &#8220;may be exempted from district-wide layoff(s) outside seniority order.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting with the Spring 2023 Budget Tie-Out Cycle, if excessing [reducing] a teacher who is a member of a population underrepresented among licensed teachers in the site, the District shall excess the next least senior teacher, who is not a member of an underrepresented population,&#8221; the report said the agreement states.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/08/16/white-minnesota-teachers-would-be-laid-off-first-under-new-contract/\">New York Post</a> bluntly explained what that means: &#8220;Minneapolis public school teachers of color will have additional job protections this upcoming school year under a new contract that would allow them to keep their jobs rather than white instructors with more seniority.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Minneapolis Star-Tribune recently reported that about 60% of the district&#8217;s students are non-white, while 16% of the district&#8217;s tenured teachers are non-white.</p>\n<p>The district excused its racist process as a method to correct &#8220;past discrimination.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The deal was &#8220;mutually&#8221; agreed to by the teachers&#8217; union and the district, a school official said.</p>\n<p>But the report noted James Dickey, senior trial counsel at the Upper Midwest Law Center, warned there will be problems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The [collective bargaining agreement] … openly discriminates against white teachers based only on the color of their skin, and not their seniority or merit,&#8221; he warned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Minneapolis teachers and taxpayers who oppose government-sponsored racism like this should stand up against it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11114637/Fury-Minneapolis-teachers-union-says-WHITE-teachers-laid-regardless-seniority.html\">Daily Mail</a> reported the result of the race-preference scheme was unadulterated &#8220;fury.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report said the contract is &#8220;causing outrage&#8221; because its procedures would have &#8220;white teachers laid off&#8221; in a system that prefers &#8220;teachers of color.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The stipulation is part of a new agreement starting in spring 2023 between the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and Minneapolis Public Schools ending a two-week long teachers&#8217; strike,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n<p>And the report said the same racial preferences would be used in bringing back teachers who were laid off, if re-hiring occurs.</p>\n<p>The report said, &#8220;The move was met with a swift backlash, with an economics professor branding it &#8216;racism in action.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Public school reform activist Christopher Rufo noted on social media, &#8220;This is the inevitable endpoint of &#8216;equity.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report noted, &#8220;On Fox News&#8217; Hannity Monday night, contributors Leo Terrell and Clay Travis both hammered the agreement. Terrell, a civil rights attorney who is black, said: &#8216;It&#8217;s racist. It&#8217;s discriminatory, it&#8217;s illegal. It should be invalidated immediately. I read what the union says. They said they want students to have teachers that look like them. Wrong. The students need teachers who will educate them. Educate. Not what they look like!\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 1776 Project Pac, a conservative political action committee, described the deal as &#8220;Breathtakingly racist and outright unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Minneapolis was decimated just two years ago by the race riots that followed the George Floyd killing, at the hands of police, with hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to local businesses and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Those riots spread quickly across the United States, eventually damaging hundreds and hundreds of cities.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Today, under Joe Biden, tens of thousands of these same heroes are denounced as rebels, conspiracy theorists, extremists and potential terrorists. Along with massive numbers of police, firemen, Border Patrol agents, Navy SEALs, pilots, air-traffic controllers, and countless other truly essential Americans, they&#8217;re all considered so dangerous as to merit termination, their professional and personal lives turned upside down due to their decision not to be injected with the experimental COVID vaccines. Biden&#8217;s tyrannical mandate threatens to cripple American society – from law enforcement to airlines to commercial supply chains to hospitals. It&#8217;s already happening. But the good news is that huge numbers of &#8220;yesterday&#8217;s heroes&#8221; are now fighting back – bravely and boldly. The whole epic showdown is laid out as never before in the sensational October issue of WND&#8217;s monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled <a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower-single-issue-october-2021/\">&#8220;THE GREAT AMERICAN REBELLION: &#8216;We will not comply!&#8217; COVID-19 power grab ignites bold new era of national defiance.&#8221;</a></i></p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Are we pinning all our hopes and dreams on the &#8220;big red wave&#8221; in 2022, most likely another rigged election? Are we fooling ourselves? Perhaps.</p>\n<p>The fact remains that the official results of the 2020 election still say Joe Biden &#8220;won.&#8221; That&#8217;s not likely to change any time soon. Most blue states are not about to change direction. We haven&#8217;t had even one meaningful victory yet in 2022 except for promising candidates being selected in primaries. None of them has been <i>elected</i> yet.</p>\n<p>When we can&#8217;t have a free and open discussion of all the illegal drop boxes placed in Democrat-heavy precincts or how the Pennsylvania Legislature unconstitutionally authorized no-excuse absentee voting or how Philadelphia clerks illegally inspected ballots and then told Democratic activists which voters needed to cure their ballots or how Wisconsin election officials ignored the state election code on nursing homes, what good does it do now?</p>\n<p>The Democrats have won the debate by default. When you accept the loss of freedom of the press, you lose the truth. We&#8217;re talking to ourselves.</p>\n<p>We now have John Daniel Davidson, senior editor at The Federalist, who is warning that the 2024 election is being rigged <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/08/2024-election-rigged-right-now-plain-sight/\">&#8220;right now in plain sight.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>While we are fascinated by the FBI&#8217;s raid on Trump&#8217;s home, under the direction of Attorney General Merrick Garland for &#8220;secret documents&#8221; belonging to the government, we may be witnessing the biggest steal yet – perhaps even planting evidence and installing bugging devices.</p>\n<p>But Davidson said the raid is just part of a larger scheme: &#8220;the rigging of the 2024 presidential election.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 2020 results weren&#8217;t stolen &#8220;so much as rigged months in advance to give Joe Biden an advantage that all but guaranteed his victory; the 2024 election is being rigged to ensure that Trump either cannot run or, if he does run, cannot win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;As some expert observers have pointed out, including my colleague Margot Cleveland, a far more plausible explanation is that the FBI was perhaps on a fishing expedition, looking for evidence that could implicate Trump in the Jan. 6 riot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that Democrats and the Jan. 6 Committee want Garland to charge Trump with &#8216;seditious conspiracy&#8217; in hopes of making it impossible for Trump to run in 2024. In that case, a documents dispute with the National Archives would be nothing more than a flimsy pretext to get into Trump&#8217;s residence and look for incriminating evidence related to Jan. 6.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This time part of the rigging is part of Big Tech&#8217;s plan to begin shutting down &#8220;misleading&#8221; and &#8220;dangerous&#8221; election claims.</p>\n<p>Get it?</p>\n<p>The Democrats are going for broke – now while they have all the power.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, they continue to ignore Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop from hell – or even the voter-roll management system used in 31 states and D.C. that is sharing voter data with the Mark Zuckerberg-funded Center for Election Innovation and Research, one of two groups Zuckerberg used during the 2020 races to send $420 million to local elections officials to influence to results for Biden. Davidson&#8217;s report said the real purpose appears to be &#8220;to boost Democrat voter turnout by forwarding state voter roll data, including records from unregistered voters, to CEIR.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He warned, &#8220;Understand that the same powerful people, companies, and nonprofits that conspired to rig the 2020 election are right now rigging the 2024 election, using many of the same tactics.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And what is to prevent the Democrats from turning a few key states their way in November 2022 to block the expected &#8220;big red wave&#8221;? Suppose it&#8217;s a bust? Are you going to bet your country on it?</p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Democrats certainly could not run an election based upon the record and glib performance of Joe Biden and his Congress. They found they needed something bigger than starting a $100 billion war on the border with Russia. They transitioned to capturing and imprisoning political prisoners, and even stagged a KKK-style congressional hearing and public lynching – but it was not enough to distract Americans.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up: zilch!</p>\n<p>Why not raid the home of the former president, and then stage a weekly &#8220;what if&#8221; or &#8220;look over here at what we found …&#8221; to feed the fear. This from the same FBI that covered up the Biden laptop from hell and the Hillary Clinton private server!</p>\n<p>What might we expect during the intervening 90 days before the November 2022 election? The search and seizure by the FBI was not necessary, but it will be a win/win for Democrats.</p>\n<p>Without the raid, the media would be forced to continue to focus on inflation and economic disaster, the classroom chaos brought by a communist-spawned CRT curriculum, the death and destruction wrought by the criminal class, repeated foreign-policy debacles, the abandonment of America&#8217;s borders, massive homelessness, record drug abuse and general failure of the Democratic Party in Congress and the White House.</p>\n<p>But with this raid, the media, which are 99.9% pure Democratic leftist, will be able to focus on their Nemesis, Donald Trump. Let the nightly shock and awe begin.</p>\n<p>To make sure the scandal runs the up to Election Day, the U.S. Justice Department and FBI &#8220;will not comment&#8221; on &#8220;an ongoing investigation,&#8221; which leaves the press free to speculate.</p>\n<p>The press speculation will portray Donald Trump as the worst criminal in history. No insult will be left unsaid. As the partisan work of the faux Jan. 6 Committee fades into nothingness, like the two impeachment trials before it, the chief players in the justice system have set the table for a Democratic victory in November. A Nov. 8 victory is the Democrats&#8217; target, not Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Two years ago the politicization of justice in America set up the election of the most unqualified, incapable presidential candidate imaginable. America has been without a president since Jan. 20, 2021. No one outside of the inner circle of the Democratic Party knows who is making the decisions.</p>\n<p>Democrats believe they are one election away from completing their revolution to replace the republic, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights with a socialist dictatorship operating on the same rules as the Communist Party of China.</p>\n<p>Americans are being herded from one crisis to another crisis, and the fear mongering will continue until the people accept one-party dictatorship. COVID and climate change come to mind.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, it took only a few days for the media to take this FBI raid nuclear.</p>\n<p>Remember the infamous slur of the daisy commercial run against Barry Goldwater by Lyndon Johnson? A beautiful little girl sits in a field of blooms, and counts and picks off the flower petals. As she counts, there is a voice-over countdown, a great flash of light, and the voice says, &#8220;These are the stakes …&#8221; Vote for Lyndon Johnson or die.</p>\n<p>That was the 1964 election, and here we are, nearly 60 years later, and the Democratic Party has not thought of a new campaign theme. It only took them hours to trot out the nuclear campaign option, this from a political party led by a man who thinks two consecutive months of 8.5% inflation means there is no inflation. The word, Joe Biden said, was &#8220;zero, zero inflation. …&#8221; That reminded one of the president falling off a bicycle.</p>\n<p>For days the media have fixated upon the search warrant. The warrant is irrelevant. What is newsworthy is the content of the documents presented to the judge by the DOJ to justify the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the application for the warrant is fiction. If the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had the evidence in hand, they would not have needed a search warrant to gather evidence, only to protect it. Since Mr. Trump was in New York Aug. 8, the FBI cannot claim urgency.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, so what if the warrant claims the boxes of materials packaged up by the General Services Administration contained classified material? Gasp! What if there was a Top Secret stamp on one of the papers?</p>\n<p>A fair-minded person might ask, since Donald Trump had nothing to do with the packing of those boxes, why would he be held responsible for the content? If he knew there was classified material in those boxes, why did he grant access to the FBI? Since the boxes were in a secure, locked room, a room that had been locked according to the direction of FBI agents, how could Donald Trump be guilty of carelessness? If the content was not secure, since the FBI ordered a lock, the FBI is responsible.</p>\n<p>Each week between now and Nov. 8, there will be a Democratic operative spreading rumors of a terrible act by Donald Trump, an act revealed by a 6th cousin, twice removed from the great grand uncle of the Mar-a-Lago cleaning lady.</p>\n<p>Normally, the GOP leadership responds to these attacks with the effectiveness of a man trying to defend against a swarm of bees using only a fly swatter. They swing at every rumor offered up by the Democrats and the media, instead of focusing on what upset the hive. In politics, that would be the many failures of what is demonstrably the worst president in the history of presidencies.</p>\n<p>The entire Biden team constantly lectures Americans on how evil the nation is and why they must accept the &#8220;transition&#8221; to another form of government. That is echoed in the halls of the United Nations and its associated agencies. The world, it seems, wants to transition to Davos. Republicans might consider defining this new form of government, since Democrats refuse to do so, and outline what it will mean to lose the right to individual freedom and the free enterprise system.</p>\n<p>In the last 48-hour new cycle it has been suggested Trump be put to death, a suggestion that pleased former CIA Director Michael Hayden. And the FBI has teamed up with Homeland Security to release a bulletin suggesting a nuclear dirty bomb might be placed near FBI headquarters and that revolutionary nationalists were threatening the transition from freedom to slavery.</p>\n<p>Imagine Joe Biden, speaking to the lady who just asked, &#8220;What kind of government did you give us, sir,&#8221; and Biden saying, &#8220;a socialist dictatorship … if you can keep it.&#8221;</p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>Mike Pottage has been a political reporter, columnist and newspaper editor headquartered in Los Angeles and Sacramento for more than 45 years.</i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But in the process, I uncovered a conspiracy among the LGBTs to basically steal the Jewish Holocaust for themselves for political leverage.</p>\n<p>Contrary to today&#8217;s rising chorus of fringe historical revisionists of the anti-Zionist movement, the Holocaust was an actual plan and policy of Nazi Germany, totally consistent with the philosophy and practice of the <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/eugenics-movement\">eugenicist elites</a> of the early 20th century. Adolf Hitler, John D. Rockefeller, John Harvey Kellogg, Margaret Sanger and Josef Mengele were the Klaus Schwabs, Justin Trudeaus, Gavin Newsoms, Jacinda Arderns and Anthony Faucis of their generation: protean transhumanist sociopaths for whom humanity was mere cattle whose utility could and should be improved by scientific experimentation and selective breeding/culling.</p>\n<p>Addressing the future of eugenic advancement in &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; (1924), Hitler praised the United States as the &#8220;one state in which at least weak beginnings toward a better conception are noticeable. Of course, it is not our model German Republic, but the United States.&#8221; He would devote his life to overcoming that shortcoming.</p>\n<p>Eugenics was the heart of Hitlerian ideology and the source for such diverse Nazi policies as the Master Race theory, the Lebensborn Aryan human breeding farms, the bizarre &#8220;science&#8221; of phrenology (skull measurements), Dr. Mengele&#8217;s lab experiments on concentration camp prisoners and, of course, hatred of the &#8220;inferior races,&#8221; especially the Jews, whom occult queen Helena Blavatski condemned in her book &#8220;The Secret Doctrine&#8221; as the holdovers of the primitive &#8220;root race&#8221; that proceeded modernity&#8217;s superior Aryan &#8220;root race&#8221; in her theory of the cyclical evolution of humankind.</p>\n<p>Crazy Blavatsky&#8217;s &#8220;Theosophical Society&#8221; was represented in Germany by Guido von List and Jorge Lanz von Liebenfels who together formed the Armanen Order that played a huge role both in Hitler&#8217;s personal life and in the creation of the Nazi Party. They were the first to use the swastika in Germany more than a decade before the Nazi Party was formed, and Lanz von Liebenfels was rightly called &#8220;The Man Who Gave Hitler His Ideas&#8221; in a 1958 book by Wilfried Daim. Hitler was an avid reader and collector of Liebenfels magazine Ostara, which blended occultism and eugenics. I have fully documented this history in Chapter 2 of &#8220;The Pink Swastika.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(I can personally attest that the Theosophical Society still operates around the world, having stumbled onto <a href=\"https://portland.theosophical.org/\">one of its lodges</a> when I lived in heavily occult-influenced Portland, Oregon. And a revived version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armanen-Orden\">Armanen Order</a> also exists in Germany.)</p>\n<p>So, yes, the Holocaust was a real historical event, and the malign ideology that spawned it is alive and well today. Attempts by nut-jobs to rehabilitate uber-eugenicist Hitler as a wrongly &#8220;canceled&#8221; and misunderstood hero of nationalism are as traitorous to humanity as they are stupid.</p>\n<p>However, my focus in this article is the Holocaust as a symbol of victimization of the Jews specifically, and how the LGBT movement has, to a limited extent, hijacked it to serve their own political agenda.</p>\n<p>Kevin Abrams and I wrote &#8220;The Pink Swastika&#8221; in large part to debunk the myth of a &#8220;Gay Holocaust&#8221; in Nazi Germany equivalent to what the Jews suffered. We proved their claims were wildly exaggerated and that their adoption of the inverted pink triangle (used by the Nazis to identify the relatively small number of homosexual in labor camps – not the death camps) was a cynical political ploy to hijack the Holocaust, just as they had hijacked the rainbow flag and <a href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/2020/08/06/the-lgbt-hijacking-of-black-power/\">control of the black civil rights movement</a> from the Black Panthers and Jesse Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;Rainbow Coalition.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to our book, we created the International Committee for Holocaust Truth in 1996, whose most prominent members were the late Drs. Judith Reisman and Howard Hurwitz, and Rabbi Yehuda Levin. We then published a report for the ICHT titled &#8220;Refuting &#8216;Gay Holocaust&#8217; Revisionists,&#8221; which I reworked for my article <a href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/2022/08/13/how-homosexuals-hijacked-the-holocaust/\">&#8220;How American &#8216;Gays&#8217; are Stealing the Holocaust,&#8221;</a> which was published as Part 3 of my book <a href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/scott-lively-books/the-poisoned-stream-gay-influence-in-human-history-germany-1890-1945/\">&#8220;The Poisoned Stream&#8221; (1997).</a></p>\n<p>Working with a national network of Orthodox rabbis, we used those tools to thwart the &#8220;Gay Holocaust&#8221; plot and forced the LGBTs to drop the pink triangle strategy. In response, they shifted to the rainbow as their banner, and they down-scaled and moved their Holocaust hijack efforts out of the public view.</p>\n<p>In 1997, during my summer law program studying International Human Rights at the University of Strasbourg (France), I took a weekend trip to nearby Munich, Germany, to visit the Dachau concentration camp in my research for the third edition of &#8220;The Pink Swastika.&#8221; There I was disappointed to find (even then) the pink triangle prominently represented in the form of a stone monument, establishing a propaganda beachhead that (I now know) was later expanded to a high-visibility <a href=\"https://forward.com/culture/376261/new-german-monument-honors-gays-and-lesbians-persecuted-by-nazis/\">&#8220;Gay Holocaust&#8221;</a> memorial in downtown Munich itself, psychologically emphasizing the special importance of the &#8220;gays&#8221; relative to the Jews as a victim class.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the new Munich memorial (which I only just learned about) commemorates the site of a &#8220;gay bar&#8221; that was the prime meeting place of Ernst Roehm&#8217;s butch-homosexual SA Brownshirts, whose role as chief Nazi perpetrators overwhelmingly dwarfs the significance of the relatively few homosexual victims they persecuted (for effeminacy and/or Communist affiliation).</p>\n<p>I had not given much thought to the &#8220;Gay Holocaust&#8221; hoax since the late &#8217;90s until a recent walk along the waterfront in New Orleans brought me face to face with its high-visibility Holocaust memorial, prominently featuring the LGBT rainbow. That brought all the memories of the Measure 9 campaign – and the Brownshirt-style bullying of the &#8220;gay&#8221; fascists we suffered – flooding back, along with a resolve to speak out anew against their continuing historical revisionism.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5030324\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/slively220816.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"287\"></p>\n<p>Note to the reader: I have decided to update and republish my 1997 ICHT report in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the Measure 9 vote in November.

And as Bourla noted, it is not FDA-approved. The drug has been authorized by the FDA for emergency to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have come so far in our efforts to battle this disease that I am confident I will have a speedy recovery,&#8221; Bourla said. &#8220;I am incredibly grateful for the tireless efforts of my Pfizer colleagues who worked to make vaccines and treatments available for me and people around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In April 2021, Bourla tweeted: &#8220;Excited to share that updated analysis from our Phase 3 study with BioNTech that also showed that our COVID-19 vaccine was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 cases in South Africa. 100%!&#8221;</p>\n<p>In May, at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/05/schwab-pfizer-ceo-conspiracy-people-attacking-us/\">Bourla was on a panel with WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who lamented that they &#8220;were both targets of the anti-vaccine movements and conspiracy people.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>Bourla complained that there is a &#8220;very fanatic group of anti-vaxxers that will go after us no matter what.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They will claim that the sun didn&#8217;t go up because people were vaccinated,&#8221; he said, suggesting the criticisms are completely detached from science.</p>\n<p>But &#8220;everything went OK,&#8221; the Pfizer CEO told Schwab, &#8220;and now, I think, we can move on.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2021/11/4959502/\">Bourla made a similar charge in November</a>, declaring people spreading &#8220;misinformation&#8221; about the vaccines were &#8220;criminals&#8221; who have cost &#8220;millions of lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/01/pfizer-ceo-2-shots-offer-limited-protection/\">he acknowledged in January that two doses of his vaccine &#8220;offer very limited protection, if any&#8221;</a> against the dominant omicron variant. And he said the mRNA vaccines &#8220;don&#8217;t have the safety profile that we hoped we can achieve with this technology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bourla, Fauci, Biden and other top officials have continued to maintain that the COVID shots protect against severe illness, hospitalization and death, despite <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/06/pfizer-trial-data-hospitalization-likely-covid-shot/\">studies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/07/joe-biden-gets-covid-science-wrong-dig-donald-trump/\">real-world data</a> to the contrary.</p>\n<p>And they continue to ignore <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/02/cdc-data-signaling-vaccine-catastrophe/\">the reports of severe illness and death attributed to the COVID vaccines in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System database</a> run by the CDC and the FDA. As of Aug. 5, VAERS contained 30,162 reports of COVID-19 vaccine-related deaths among a total of more than 1.3 million adverse events.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Today, under Joe Biden, tens of thousands of these same heroes are denounced as rebels, conspiracy theorists, extremists and potential terrorists. Along with massive numbers of police, firemen, Border Patrol agents, Navy SEALs, pilots, air-traffic controllers, and countless other truly essential Americans, they&#8217;re all considered so dangerous as to merit termination, their professional and personal lives turned upside down due to their decision not to be injected with the experimental COVID vaccines. Biden&#8217;s tyrannical mandate threatens to cripple American society – from law enforcement to airlines to commercial supply chains to hospitals. It&#8217;s already happening. But the good news is that huge numbers of &#8220;yesterday&#8217;s heroes&#8221; are now fighting back – bravely and boldly. The whole epic showdown is laid out as never before in the sensational October issue of WND&#8217;s monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled <a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower-single-issue-october-2021/\">&#8220;THE GREAT AMERICAN REBELLION: &#8216;We will not comply!&#8217; COVID-19 power grab ignites bold new era of national defiance.&#8221;</a></i></p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The FBI and DHS would like to ensure that law enforcement, court, and government personnel are aware of the range of threats and criminal and violent incidents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bulletin even goes on to make a wild claim about a possibility of a nuclear explosion.</p>\n<p>It warns that &#8220;the FBI and DHS have observed an increase in violent threats posted on social media against federal officials and facilities, including a threat to place a so-called dirty bomb in front of FBI Headquarters and issuing general calls for &#8216;civil war&#8217; and &#8216;armed rebellion.\'&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The bulletin warned the threats are &#8220;specific in identifying proposed targets, tactics, or weaponry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then, of course, two of the most corrupt agencies in the bloated federal government tied it all back to Trump.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since 8 August 2022, the FBI and DHS have identified multiple articulated threats and calls for the targeted killing of judicial, law enforcement, and government officials associated with the Palm Beach search, including the federal judge who approved the Palm Beach search warrant,&#8221; it adds. &#8220;The FBI and DHS have also observed the personal identifying information of possible targets of violence, such as home addresses and identification of family members, disseminated online as additional targets.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The bulletin went on to cite the bozo in Ohio, &#8220;gunman&#8221; Ricky Shiffer, who tried to enter the FBI&#8217;s Cincinnati Field Office using a nail gun.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On 11 August 2022, Ricky Shiffer, Jr., wearing a technical vest and armed with an AR-style rifle and a nail gun, attempted to forcibly enter the FBI&#8217;s Cincinnati Field Office. When uniformed officers responded to Shiffer&#8217;s attempt to break a glass barrier, he fled the scene,&#8221; the bulletin said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A pursuit ensued, and Shiffer entered a standoff with FBI and law enforcement officers after firing multiple shots at responding officers from the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP).

Michael Hayden responded: &#8220;Sounds about right.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Sounds about right. <a href=\"https://t.co/hJCjxhN2BQ\">https://t.co/hJCjxhN2BQ</a></p>\n<p>— Gen Michael Hayden (@GenMhayden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GenMhayden/status/1557899501926596609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2022</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The FBI is investigating the former President of the United States for possible violations of the Espionage Act as well as removal or destruction of records, obstruction of an investigation which can result in fines or even imprisonment, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/12/search-warrant-shows-trump-under-investigation-for-potential-obstruction-of-justice-espionage-act-violations-00051507\">according to Politico</a>:</p>\n<p><em>The documents, which are expected to be unsealed later Friday after the Justice Department sought their public disclosure amid relentless attacks by Trump and his GOP allies, underscore the extraordinary national security threat that federal investigators believed the missing documents presented. The concern grew so acute that Attorney General Merrick Garland approved the unprecedented search of Trump’s estate last week.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>While reports have suggested that Trump &#8216;stole&#8217; classified information, the fact is, as <em>president</em>, he had the ultimate authority to declassify anything he wanted &#8212; just like previous presidents. The deep state likes to pretend that Executive Branch privileges and authorities existed only before and after Trump, but not during his term. That is a lie.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, there are plenty of people who are aware of just how big a lie that is.</p>\n<p>In an interview with Fox News&#8217; Maria Bartiromo over the weekend, former Trump national security figure Kash Patel addressed the issue.</p>\n<p>“He can literally stand over a set of documents and say these are now declassified and that is done with definitive action immediately,” Patel explained.</p>\n<p>Bartiromo <a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/you-jerks-devin-nunes-furious-with-trump-raid-65571/\">then cited reports that a grand jury has been convened</a> and espionage charges against the former president have been discussed, while asking another guest, former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) &#8212; now CEO of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group &#8212; to respond.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I think that’s another really important point that shouldn’t be lost on the American people today, and that is that they convened a grand jury against the former president of the United States,” the former lawmaker said.</p>\n<p>“And they went into the grand jury looking at the president for treason as if he’s, And look, if that was the case, if he really was holding these these these documents, these so-called classified documents and documents, we even heard, you know, leaks of nuclear secrets that the president was holding. Well, that’s preposterous. And if that was true, you should have sent, they should have immediately sent and made this public and sent FBI agents around Mar-a-Lago if the nuclear secrets were really there,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“But the fact that they convened a grand jury to accuse a president, again, this look, this is the second time, this never stopped. Remember, back in 15 and 16 is when they started first saying that he was colluding with Russians and Vladimir Putin and Republicans were all colluding with the Russians. They went to a grand jury with that,” he argued.</p>\n<p>“So so once again, this is a continued investigation of Trump and the Republican Party. It’s basically an investigation in search of a crime. And then conveniently, they brought back the Mueller witch hunt argument that ‘Oh, my God, he’s he’s obstructing justice,’” Nunes added.</p>\n<p>“Obstructing justice on what? you jerks!” he said.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://www.trump.news\">a full-court press on to indict Trum</a>p so he can&#8217;t run for the presidency again in 2024. This is how frightened the deep state is of him and his influence on our country.</p>\n<p>WATCH:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/you-jerks-devin-nunes-furious-with-trump-raid-65571/\">ConservativeBrief.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/12/search-warrant-shows-trump-under-investigation-for-potential-obstruction-of-justice-espionage-act-violations-00051507\">Politico.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-former-cia-nsa-director-trump-should-be-executed-if-guilty-espionage.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Trump Derangement Syndrome: Former CIA, NSA director Michael Hayden suggests Trump should be EXECUTED if guilty of ‘espionage’\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-former-cia-nsa-director-trump-should-be-executed-if-guilty-espionage.html&linkname=Trump%20Derangement%20Syndrome%3A%20Former%20CIA%2C%20NSA%20director%20Michael%20Hayden%20suggests%20Trump%20should%20be%20EXECUTED%20if%20guilty%20of%20%E2%80%98espionage%E2%80%99\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-former-cia-nsa-director-trump-should-be-executed-if-guilty-espionage.html&linkname=Trump%20Derangement%20Syndrome%3A%20Former%20CIA%2C%20NSA%20director%20Michael%20Hayden%20suggests%20Trump%20should%20be%20EXECUTED%20if%20guilty%20of%20%E2%80%98espionage%E2%80%99\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-former-cia-nsa-director-trump-should-be-executed-if-guilty-espionage.html&linkname=Trump%20Derangement%20Syndrome%3A%20Former%20CIA%2C%20NSA%20director%20Michael%20Hayden%20suggests%20Trump%20should%20be%20EXECUTED%20if%20guilty%20of%20%E2%80%98espionage%E2%80%99\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-former-cia-nsa-director-trump-should-be-executed-if-guilty-espionage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-16 12:36:16', '82', '', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '2032-08-13 19:28:33', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '19', '', '', '1', '1', '{}', '0', '*', '', '');/**ABDB**/
