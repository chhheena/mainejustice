She warned that the agencies are doing this to average Americans. Trump accused the agencies of “prosecutorial misconduct” and political weaponization to prevent his reelection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact that it’s coming back on the FBI and the Department of Justice to show how corrupt and how overreaching they are, that I suppose could be a silver lining, but I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. And if anything, I think it highlights how extreme the FBI has become. If they’re doing this to Donald Trump, everybody says ‘oh, maybe they could do it to me.’ Now we can look back and say they probably were doing it to regular Americans.

Twenty years of ineffective counterterrorism policies culminated in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, but the Taliban&rsquo;s renewed safe haven for jihadis is not the primary problem.

During his address at the George Washington University Program on Extremism Symposium, Olsen stated, &ldquo;this is among the most challenging and complex threat landscapes that I have seen in over 20 years working in counterterrorism.&rdquo;</p> <p>He subsequently argued that &ldquo;the insular and often rapid nature of their radicalization and mobilization to violence&rdquo; increases the difficulty of countering these organizations. This increased difficulty applies only to those who ignore the fact that these jihadist groups conceal their operational discourses in Islamic terminology, religious edicts and sermons, most of which are obscure to Westerners like Olsen.</p> <p>If you know where to look, it is not too challenging.

They understand that outside factors, including Russian hostilities in Ukraine and refinery bottlenecks, continue to create upward pressure on oil prices, even if recessionary fears act in the opposite direction. What they do not get is why the Biden administration seems to take every opportunity to keep American oil and gas sidelined.</p> <p>They remember 2011 when <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_nus_w.htm\">gasoline retail</a> hit $4/gallon (<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_spt_s1_w.htm\">crude oil</a> prices had reached over $113/barrel). But they also remember something remarkable. We started reaping the benefits of American ingenuity. <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/news/the-lives-they-lived/2013/12/21/george-mitchell/\">George Mitchell</a> combined two old technologies, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, to solve the riddle of tapping America&rsquo;s vast but previously trapped shale oil and gas resources.</p> <p>Thanks to fracking, American production quickly proved an effective counter to OPEC and Russia. High cartel prices per barrel incentivized more U.S. production, causing oil and gasoline prices to plummet (bottoming out in 2016 at below $30/barrel and $2/gal.). By 2018, domestic production of crude oil was <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/ERP-2020/pdf/ERP-2020.pdf\">85% higher</a> than the U.S. Energy Information Administration had projected in 2011, the price per barrel was around $65, gasoline retail was around $2.81/gal., and the U.S. had become the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40973\">world&rsquo;s top producer of crude oil and natural gas</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"outbrainPlaceholder\"></div> <div class=\"readmore\"></div> <div id=\"rev-more-content\"> <p>Happily, for American families, the effect of the shale revolution was energy savings worth an estimated $2,500 for a family of four.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after telling campaign audiences he would <a href=\"https://www.atr.org/biden-yes-we-should-end-fracking/\">stop pipelines and fracking</a> and that oil and gas executives should be put &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7837265/We-jail-Biden-wants-prosecute-fossil-fuel-executives-environment-damage.html\">in jail</a>,&rdquo; President Biden canceled Keystone XL pipeline permitting and the planned oil and gas leasing in Alaska <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/\">on his very first day </a>in office. He then ordered the suspension of new oil and gas permits on federal land and waterways and a review of existing permits.</p> <p>The moratorium was eventually <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/06/15/1006948814/bidens-ban-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases-is-blocked-by-a-federal-judge\">blocked by a federal judge</a>, so the Biden administration chose to dig in its heels. This May, the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/14276511/interior-cancels-two-gom-offshore-lease-sales-and-cook-inlet-sale\">canceled more offshore oil and gas lease sales</a> in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. In June, they <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-administration-drilling-plan-may-exclude-all-waters-beyond-gulf-mexico-2022-06-30/\">delayed the announcement</a> of a new federal plan for offshore oil and gas development leasing only to release a plan that <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/former-trump-official-biden-administrations-oil-drilling-proposal-reducing-lease-sales\">limits federal leasing and allows for the option of no leasing at all</a>.</p> <p>President Biden seems to think the hardships Americans face from historically high energy prices can be solved by gimmicks: non emergency releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, suspending the federal gasoline excise tax, or calling inflation &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/22/remarks-by-president-biden-on-gas-prices-and-putins-price-hike/\">Putin&rsquo;s price hike</a>.&rdquo; Meanwhile, he has demanded answers from oil companies for high gasoline prices and spoken of taking <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/news/read-bidens-full-letter-to-oil-companies-demanding-help-on-gas-prices-historically-high-profit-margins-are-unacceptable/\">emergency executive actions</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"piano-newsletter\" class=\"piano-newsletter\"> </div> <p>The answer lies in what a different president explained on his first day in office. &ldquo;It is no coincidence,&rdquo; said President Ronald Reagan in his inaugural address, &ldquo;that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government.&rdquo; The petroleum and coal industries are by far the nation&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/mclaughlin-sherouse-list-10-most-regulated-industries-2014\">most heavily regulated</a>.</p> <p>So U.S. oil and gas executives responded to President Biden&rsquo;s demand by offering practical ways to remove unnecessary and excessive government limitations. Among other things, <a href=\"https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2022/0615_ExxonMobil-statement-regarding-President-Biden-Letter-to-Oil-Industry\">ExxonMobil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.afpm.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/20220615%20POTUS%20Letter%20re%20Refining%20Capacity%20FINAL_AFPM_API.pdf\">American Fuel &amp; Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute</a> urged lowering regulatory costs, streamlining pipeline approvals and other infrastructure development, waiving provisions of the Jones Act, not playing favorites with energy technologies and clearly and consistently favoring domestic resource development.</p> <p>This issue is too important for gimmicks and threats. Americans need the Biden administration to remove the regulatory constraints, support infrastructure and resource development and set aside ideological hostility so our domestic energy industry can again be a game-changer.</p> <p><em>Jon Sanders is the director of the Center for Food, Power, and Life at the John Locke Foundation.

Moore reasons', 'with both men to get them to stop and completely diffused the heated argument from worsening. His maturity in this moment may have prevented someone from getting injured. By interjecting himself, he helped keep the Panthers Fan Fest from turning sideways.</p> <p>Not every athlete or public figure would get involved in an argument the way that Moore did. His bravery is telling on the sort of person that he is. <strong><a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/08/mets-braves-fans-fight-video-citi-field/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(RELATED: One Knocked Out In Citi Field Fight Caught On Video)</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>During the 2021-22 NFL season, Moore performed very well.

His play was rewarded with a massive contract extension over the off-season.

Morgan said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it doesn&#8217;t turn out to be there, that there are legitimate questions, I think, from the Trump supporters about the different standards applied to Donald Trump that hasn&#8217;t been applied to Hillary Clinton, to James Comey, to Hunter Biden and the others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maher mocked Trump defenders who suggest the FBI &#8220;planted&#8221;

He sounded angry but was not initially physical with her despite her repeated challenges', 'and mocking language that included her derisively referring to him as fat and &#8220;a faggot,&#8221; which she repeated.</p>\n<p>He kept occupying the space she vacated in her retreat from his imposing physical advantage but seemed to take courage from knowing the encounter was being filmed. She sneeringly threw that knowledge in his face in a challenge to counter his towering rage. She pushed him away from her hard at least twice, and he did not physically respond to her laying both hands on him and pushing him.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the second push, a man stepped between them in an apparent attempt to deescalate the situation. The unidentified woman called him a dumbass and a word that may have been &#8220;bigger&#8221; from behind the interceding man. She then stepped to his right to try and hit the Spirit employee. Her first attempt seemed to fall short so she moved closer and smacked the top left side of his head.</p>\n<p>The combination of hateful words that preceded the slap, followed by the smack on the head, seemed to unhinge the airline employee. He pushed away the man trying to deescalate and went after his assailant, whom he tackled below the waist.</p>\n<p>She quickly regained her feet and started to run away but was not fast enough to dodge a punch to the back of her head from the Spirit employee. A scrum of men rushed to surround the angry man.</p>\n<p>“Everybody! Back up from me!&#8221; the enraged agent yelled. &#8220;This bitch put her hands on me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They quickly backed away as the agent&#8217;s enraged yells were accompanied by him tossing lane separators around.</p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62899 \" id=\"quads-ad62899\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n<div id=\"ld-4094-4953\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>Eventually, a taller Black man got in his face and remained glued to his front telling him it was not OK to hit a woman. The man was seemingly unswayed by the words the airline employee used to justify his acts. The video soon ends, presumably because no further fighting occurred between him and the woman.</p>\n<p>Spirit Airlines acknowledged they were aware of the incident, according to a New York Post report.</p>\n<p>“Our vendor at DFW has suspended the agent,” the company said in the Post report. “Spirit Airlines does not tolerate violence of any kind, and we are working with local law enforcement to investigate this matter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Watch:</p>\n<div id=\"wpfp_c199bb5adc5721b81efca47ebe80c6e2\" data-item=\"{&quot;sources&quot;:[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/vz-4d4ff1a3-0e2.b-cdn.net\\/2f82f3a7-95fe-48ec-a4b1-5e7b5b647ce0\\/playlist.m3u8&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;application\\/x-mpegurl&quot;}],&quot;id&quot;:&quot;731&quot;,&quot;fv_title&quot;:&quot;DTX-Daily-httpst-cojdLKLWR6Cj&quot;,&quot;splash&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/resistthemainstream.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2022\\/08\\/FotoJet-1-4.jpg&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:90}\" class=\"flowplayer no-brand is-splash no-svg is-paused skin-slim fp-slim fp-edgy has-caption\" data-fv-embed=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/watch-spirit-airlines-agent-suspended-after-trading-blows-with-female-passenger/fvp-732/\" style=\"max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px; \" data-ratio=\"0.5625\">\n<div class=\"fp-ratio\" style=\"padding-top: 56.25%\"></div>\n<img class=\"fp-splash\" alt=\"DTX-Daily-httpst-cojdLKLWR6Cj\" src=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FotoJet-1-4.jpg\">\n<div class=\"fp-ui\">\nPlease enable JavaScript\n<div class=\"fp-preload\">\n<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fvp-share-bar\">\n\n<a class=\"sharing-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fresistthemainstream.org%2Fwatch-spirit-airlines-agent-suspended-after-trading-blows-with-female-passenger%2F\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n<a class=\"sharing-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Watch%3A+Spirit+Airlines+Agent+Suspended+After+Trading+Blows+With+Female+Passenger++&url=https%3A%2F%2Fresistthemainstream.org%2Fwatch-spirit-airlines-agent-suspended-after-trading-blows-with-female-passenger%2F\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n<a class=\"sharing-email\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8db2efe2e9f4b0cee5e8eee6a8bfbde2f8f9a8bfbdf9e5e8a8bfbdece0ecf7e4e3eaa8bfbdfbe4e9e8e2a8bfbde5e8ffe8a8becca8bfbde5f9f9fdfea8becca8bfcba8bfcbffe8fee4fef9f9e5e8e0ece4e3fef9ffe8ece0a3e2ffeaa8bfcbfaecf9eee5a0fefde4ffe4f9a0ece4ffe1e4e3e8fea0eceae8e3f9a0fef8fefde8e3e9e8e9a0ecebf9e8ffa0f9ffece9e4e3eaa0efe1e2fafea0fae4f9e5a0ebe8e0ece1e8a0fdecfefee8e3eae8ffa8bfcb\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\n<div><a class=\"sharing-link\" href=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/watch-spirit-airlines-agent-suspended-after-trading-blows-with-female-passenger/\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a></div>\n<div><a class=\"embed-code-toggle\" href=\"#\"><strong>Embed</strong></a></div>\n<div class=\"embed-code\">\nCopy and paste this HTML code into your webpage to embed.\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"fp-caption\">DTX-Daily-httpst-cojdLKLWR6Cj</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"rumble_v1da5z3\"></div>\n<p></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad64185 \" id=\"quads-ad64185\" style=\"float:left;margin:0px 0px 0px 0;padding:10px 10px 10px 0;\">\n<p removeable><strong><i>Scroll down to leave a comment and share your thoughts.</i></strong></p>\n<div removeable id=\"ld-9325-4135\"></div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/watch-spirit-airlines-agent-suspended-after-trading-blows-with-female-passenger/\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 20:55:16', '82', '', '2022-08-14 03:03:20', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-14 03:03:20', '2032-08-11 03:03:24', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '90', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

insinuated Perez, &#8220;managed to get it to right wing news organizations, and at least one of them published a', 'document in total, including the names of those federal agents who were simply doing their job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is true that the court withheld agents&#8217; names by redacting their identities on the copies released to the public after the Albany Times Union and Judicial Watch asked the court for their release. Later, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland owned up to authorizing the raid on Trump&#8217;s Florida home and asked the court to release a redacted copy of the warrant.</p>\n<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart Friday released redacted copies of the warrant. Requests to unseal the warrant&#8217;s underlying probable cause affidavit have not been decided yet. Legal experts note it is unusual for courts to unseal those affidavits before an indictment. But raiding the home of a former president of the United States is without precedent, so it remains to be seen how that goes.</p>\n<p>Perez ignored logic by jumping to his conclusion that Trump sent Breitbart an unredacted copy of the warrant application. He and his attorneys are not the only ones to have access to the original documents.</p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62899 \" id=\"quads-ad62899\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n<div id=\"ld-4094-4953\"></div>\n</div>\n<p>Reinhart&#8217;s clerk would have access to the original document as would anyone in the county clerk&#8217;s office where the documents were filed. Justice Department officials who are relentlessly pursuing the former president would have access to an unredacted copy of the warrant, also.</p>\n<p>Finally, the FBI has a past history of document manipulation in their dogged determination to end Trump. FBI Director James Comey <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-russiagate-steele-dossier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">briefed</a> Trump about the infamous Steele Dossier and then leaked about the meeting to Buzzfeed. That FBI leak was promptly followed by Buzzfeed publishing the disinformation document developed by Hillary Clinton campaign operatives.</p>\n<p>Then, FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/01/29/clinesmith-durham-report-investigation-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pleaded</a> guilty to falsifying a document used in a FISA court warrant application to spy on a member of Trump&#8217;s 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Senior FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged many anti-Trump texts while he was leading an investigation against him. FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his lover, texted for assurance Trump was “not ever going to become president, right? Right?!”</p>\n<p>“No. No he’s not,&#8221; Strzok responded, &#8220;We’ll stop it.”</p>\n<p>So, it is not beyond reason to consider FBI agents anonymously gave Breitbart News an unredacted copy of the arrest warrant in another attempt to discredit the likely 2024 GOP presidential candidate.</p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad64185 \" id=\"quads-ad64185\" style=\"float:left;margin:0px 0px 0px 0;padding:10px 10px 10px 0;\">\n<p removeable><strong><i>Scroll down to leave a comment and share your thoughts.</i></strong></p>\n<div removeable id=\"ld-9325-4135\"></div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/cnn-reporter-says-he-believes-he-knows-who-leaked-trump-warrant/\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '150', '2022-08-13 18:35:40', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:16:47', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-14 03:03:20', '2032-08-11 03:03:24', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '88', '', '', '1', '1', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Jared Polis recently sent a letter to voters accompanying a tax refund that essentially was &#8220;indistinguishable from a campaign mailer,&#8221; according to the state GOP.</p>\n<p>So they&#8217;ve filed a complaint about his politicization of a refund that is constitutionally required – and comes under a program that Polis and other Democrats, in fact, have repeatedly attacked and tried to kill as recently as a few months ago.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://denvergazette.com/premium/colorado-gop-files-complaint-against-polis-over-governors-letter-touting-tabor-refund/article_911c5b08-8e2a-57b6-8d78-b7ff27bd0054.html\">Denver Gazette,</a> the state GOP claims that Polis is violating campaign finance law with his letter.</p>\n<p>GOP Chair Kristi Burton Brown called Polis&#8217; move a &#8220;political stunt&#8221; because of Polis&#8217; letter with the refunds &#8212; $750 for individual taxpayers and $1,500 for couples.</p>\n<p>The fact is that Coloradans are getting the money because of their vote adopting, 30 years ago, the Taxpayers Bill of Rights, which is in the state constitution and limits government spending increases to the rate of inflation and rate of population increase.</p>\n<p>Typically, when the state takes in more money than allowed under TABOR as it has recently, the overage is refunded to taxpayers through mechanisms like property tax reductions and a lowered state income tax rate.</p>\n<p>But Polis, and his Democrat majority in the state legislature, decided this year to create a &#8220;Colorado CashBack&#8221; program that doesn&#8217;t reference the constitutional requirement, and sends the money to voters just as the 2022 election season, in which Polis is seeking re-election, is ramping up.</p>\n<p>The program is to distribute about $2.7 billion of an anticipated surplus of $3.5 billion, with the rest to be coming to taxpayers in the spring.</p>\n<p>Critics have charged that the move is a &#8220;blatant attempt to curry favor with voters, who start returning mail ballots in mid-October,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n<p>Colorado&#8217;s elections are all by mail.</p>\n<p>The Gazette reported, &#8220;Burton Brown and other Republicans have been crying foul for months over Polis and Democrats taking credit for the refund program after trying to repeal the TABOR provisions that require the state to refund surplus revenue, including with Proposition CC, a failed 2019 statewide ballot measure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Burton Brown said, &#8220;Jared Polis is blatantly using taxpayer dollars to help himself get re-elected.</p>\n<p>Polis&#8217; letter credits the state&#8217;s &#8220;strong economic growth and our successful work to close special interest tax loopholes&#8221; for the refunds, only mentioning in passing &#8220;Colorado law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He did include in his letter multiple mentions of his name.</p>\n<p>The complaint was filed with the Colorado Secretary of State&#8217;s office, and accuses Polis of representing the refunds as if they are part of a special program he set up, not a constitutional requirement.</p>\n<p>Heidi Ganahl, Polis&#8217; Republican challenger, said the state funds spent on mailing the checks and letter, estimated at $2.7 million – should be considered a &#8220;campaign expenditure&#8221; and it should be paid back to the people of Colorado.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just two years ago, Jared Polis tried to kill TABOR. I spent almost a year defending TABOR when I chaired No on Prop CC. As governor, I will be honest and transparent about how my administration spends your money,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>A spokesman in the governor&#8217;s office defended the blatant promotion of Polis&#8217; name in the refund information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/08/dems-brag-sending-checks-taxpayers-program-tried-kill/\">WND earlier reported</a> that the refunds to Colorado taxpayers are not optional, and certainly not part of the agenda of the Democrats, who have fought TABOR for 30 years and repeatedly have tried to kill it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be fooled when your TABOR refund check hits your mailbox later this month,&#8221; Michael Fields of Advance Colorado told the Gazette. &#8220;Remember liberal legislators tried to take them away in 2019. Gov. Polis and Democratic lawmakers want you to think it&#8217;s some kind of gift from them. But really, this is just an election-year gimmick to try to get your vote.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In actuality, the constitution would require all of the overage to be returned to taxpayers during the tax filing season in 2023. But heading into the 2022 vote, Democrats designated a couple of billion dollars that would have to be refunded to be sent out just as the 2022 election seasons hits full swing.</p>\n<p>The Gazette explained, &#8220;Democrats have railed against TABOR for most of its 30-year history, including filing a lawsuit filed in 2011 that was finally abandoned by the Democratic plaintiffs in March when they chose not to appeal a 10th Circuit Court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But they now &#8220;sing a different tune.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Polis, in fact, has held three press conferences to promote the fact that the money is being returned to taxpayers now.</p>\n<p>But just three years ago, Polis and Democratic lawmakers pushed for a ballot measure – Proposition CC – that would have given them permission to keep all the extra money.</p>\n<p>Voters refused.</p>\n<p>The Polis administration also has been second-rate when delivering income tax refunds. Some Colorado taxpayers who filed before the April deadline this year still have not gotten the refunds due them, some four months later.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

By comparison, St. Louis has a rate of 38.2 murders per 100,000 people and Baltimore a rate of 37.3,</p>\n<p>In Chicago, the 2022 murder rate is about 14.8 per 100,000, based on data compiled by CBS News from the FBI&#8217;s 2019 Crime in the United States report.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2021/02/study-homicide-rate-spiked-death-george-floyd/\">WND reported</a>, a study of 19 cities showed a spike in murders immediately after the death of George Floyd in May 2020, confirming analysts who attribute the record homicide rate to the &#8220;Minneapolis Effect.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The homicide rate was flat until the unrest and the subsequent defund-the-police movement that followed the death of a black man in police custody.</p>\n<p>Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald coined the term &#8220;Ferguson Effect&#8221; in the wake of the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. As police backed off from discretionary enforcement, an additional 2,000 blacks lost their lives in 2015-16 compared to the previous period. <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2020/07/minneapolis-effect-crime-spike-follows-anti-cop-push/\">The &#8220;Minneapolis Effect,&#8221; she said,</a> was far worse, making the &#8220;Ferguson Effect&#8221; looking like &#8220;child&#8217;s play.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the weeks following Floyd&#8217;s death on Memorial Day, for example, homicides rose 100% in Minneapolis, 200% in Seattle, 240% in Atlanta and 182% in Chicago.

Our college should encourage us to discuss and sharpen our ideas, not shut down the conversation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was last fall that Alejandro and fellow club members Daniel Flores and Juliette Colunga obtained permission from college officials to hang three flyers on bulletin boards that also are used by a wide range of other interests.</p>\n<p>The opinions posted advocated for freedom – and they listed the death tolls of various communist regimes.</p>\n<p>A public records request revealed that one Clovis school administrator volunteered he &#8220;gladly&#8221; would take the flyers down and censor the students&#8217; perspectives because someone had complained about their message.</p>\n<p>Cited was a school policy stating, &#8220;Posters with inappropriate or offense (sic) language or themes are not permitted…&#8221;</p>\n<p>FIRE explained how the school officials next manipulated the truth to have the flyers removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On Nov. 12, Clovis President Lori Bennett personally ordered the flyers removed. After doing so, she searched for a reason to justify the viewpoint discrimination, inventing a brand new rule requiring flyers to double as club announcements,&#8221; FIRE reported.</p>\n<p>Bennett actually wrote, &#8220;If you need a reason, you can let them know that [we] agreed they aren’t club announcements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, FIRE pointed out, &#8220;Clovis does not have a policy on the books that requires flyers to be club announcements. But with this excuse in hand, Clovis employees told student workers to remove the flyers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Officials then used their &#8220;pretextual justification&#8221; to banish other flyers that had been approved earlier to a &#8220;rotting &#8216;free speech kiosk\'&#8221; in a remote part of the campus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By relegating the flyers to a tiny kiosk, Clovis administrators tried to ensure that YAF’s opinions would never reach the rest of campus,&#8221; explained FIRE lawyer Jeff Zeman. &#8220;But FIRE’s here to amplify the voices that censors try to silence and make sure that all Clovis students are heard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The organization advocating for students pointed out that public colleges, like Clovis, are required to follow the First Amendment, under which it is unconstitutional to treat student groups differently based on their viewpoints.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Free speech is under attack on campuses across the nation, and the recent improper action by Clovis Community College constitutes yet another disappointing example,&#8221; said Young America’s Foundation President Gov. Scott Walker. &#8220;By attempting to stifle the speech of the conservative students in our Young Americans for Freedom chapter, Clovis administrators engaged in unlawful censorship in violation of the First Amendment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The lawsuit is against the college president and other officials, and seeks to change an unconstitutional policy and hold officials &#8220;personally accountable for violating students&#8217; clearly established free speech rights.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

In a 2-1 ruling, it found that &#8216;Sabra suffered no First Amendment injury through his mere exposure to inflammatory course materials.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Damask told the Investigative Project on Terrorism, &#8220;This is a win for civilization. Our values, our institutions are being eroded all around us. It&#8217;s an odd coalition of the left and multiculturalists and the psychotic, and they&#8217;re working to undermine everything that&#8217;s core, that&#8217;s central to America. And here&#8217;s one little bright spot that our core values, our institutions like higher education, have been saved.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He continues to teach the World Politics course.</p>\n<p>Explained Emerson, &#8220;CAIR&#8217;s lawsuit wanted to force the removal of course materials it claimed to &#8216;have the primary effect of disapproving of Islam.&#8217; It also took issue with a slide in Damask&#8217;s lessons that featured an image of Islam&#8217;s prophet Muhammad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Islamic activists have worked on just such a campaign for years already, through international organizations like the United Nations, claiming that its agenda is to prevent the &#8220;defamation&#8221; of religions. It wants that &#8220;defamation&#8221; outlawed worldwide. However, in its proposals, only Islam is protected.</p>\n<p>Damask told Emerson, &#8220;Their arguments are gibberish and I think they know that.&#8221; But he said CAIR was looking to &#8220;intimidate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When Sabra complained about the lesson, Damask had explained his course wasn&#8217;t &#8220;for&#8221; or &#8220;against&#8221; anything. Instead, it was focused on describing international politics.</p>\n<p>Damask said, &#8220;In teaching about terrorism, understanding what is motivating tens of thousands of young men across the Muslim world, middle and upper class&#8221; to join jihad is significant.</p>\n<p>The 9th Circuit said a previous 4th Circuit ruling already had found that asking students to know the facts about a religious teaching was not the same as requiring them to adopt it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

Applicants must prove that traditional public schools are over-enrolled, not just failing to serve the needs of their students; must seek approval from existing public schools; and must show that they are not serving too many students who are racial minorities,&#8221; Pacific Legal explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This new rule will profoundly harm children who need the educational opportunities that charter schools provide,&#8221; explained Dan Quisenberry, president of Michigan’s Charter School Association. &#8220;Charter schools shouldn’t be punished just because traditional public schools —and the current administration — don’t like them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Caleb Kurckenberg, a lawyer with the foundation, explained, &#8220;This attack on charter schools is not only deeply unfair to kids who would benefit from educational alternatives, it’s illegal. The Department of Education has no authority to issue these new rules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The agency cannot advance a policy agenda contrary to Congress’ clear instructions otherwise,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The case has been filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan.</p>\n<p>The complaint is on behalf of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies and Thomas B. Fordham Institute against the U.S. Department of Education, Education secretary Miguel Cardona, and Ruth Ryder, the deputy assistant secretary for policy and programs.</p>\n<p>The complaint explains that while Congress set aside much money for innovative and high-quality charters that can help many students, the DOE under Joe Biden is blocking that move.</p>\n<p>The agency, the complaint charges, &#8220;is channeling the administration&#8217;s apparent hostility toward charter schools into unconstitutional rulemaking, which will rob the neediest students of educational opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The department has set out new criteria for grant awards that are designed to decrease charter school programs, and ensure that failing public schools don’t have to compete with innovative alternatives,&#8221; the complaint charges. &#8220;The department’s attack on the charter school program it is tasked with administering is unlawful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not only does the department lack the authority to issue any new criteria; the proposed factors will punish the most successful charter school programs, particularly in school districts that enroll large numbers of minority students. All the while, the rule comes from an agency employee, and lacks even the blessing of a properly appointed officer of the United States. The department’s sneak attack on the charter school program, and on the students caught in the middle, must be set aside by this court.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the law requires the Department of Education to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to charters each year, it does not &#8220;include any delegation of authority for the secretary to consider or implement new criteria or priorities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite that, Biden&#8217;s agency created a long list of new requirements, such as considering whether students would be &#8220;racially and socioeconomically diverse&#8221; and whether the organization has successfully worked with &#8220;low-performing&#8221; schools.</p>\n<p>Biden, who repeatedly has opposed charter school programs, took office and his bureaucrats immediately issued &#8220;additional … criteria&#8221; for any project.</p>\n<p>The action seeks an injunction prohibiting Biden&#8217;s agenda from enforcing their additional rules for grants.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

But Hoekstra noted that the &#8220;investigative reporting by these two organizations was so thorough and groundbreaking it turned up things that were not even there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And even worse, the Pulitzer Committee refused to rescind the honors, thereby earning itself its own prize – &#8220;for fraud.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That scenario explains, Hoekstra explained, &#8220;why so many Americans have been losing trust in their institutions, both public and private.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then, he said, there is the Russia hoax.</p>\n<p>It is &#8220;emblematic of the model built by the anti-Trump, anti-America First, anti-populist movement that the American people have experienced for the last six years. It embodies many of the characteristics that have frustrated Americans. It is a combination of influential forces – media, social media, political players, and government – that put forward information detrimental to one – oddly always the same – political viewpoint,&#8221; Hoekstra wrote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this instance, populists – believers in the rights, wisdom or virtues of the common people, according to Merriam Webster – who might embrace the concept of personal freedom espoused by the Constitution, a free market economy, economic growth, energy independence, school choice, equal application of the law and decentralized governance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That smear scheme, of course, was funded by Hillary Clinton-linked associates, pushed by Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussman and leaked to the press to damage President Trump.</p>\n<p>What resulted was Robert Mueller&#8217;s multi-year, multi-million dollar &#8220;Russiagate&#8221; review, which hindered Trump&#8217;s first two years in office and debunked the conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p>Then there is the &#8220;kidnapping plot&#8221; against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. A jury concluded the FBI &#8220;entrapped&#8221; two of the accused, he explained.</p>\n<p>But the media claimed through it was the plot of &#8220;domestic terrorists,&#8221; i.e. Trump supporters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Whitmer went so far as to accuse Trump of being complicit in the plan, even though it emerged that these alleged plotters had also supposedly wanted to hang Trump,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>And the COVID pandemic, he noted. &#8220;The &#8216;facts&#8217; at the time were supposedly that it came from &#8216;nature&#8217; and that the Chinese Communist Party government had supposedly known nothing about its human-to-human transmissibility, even though it had &#8216;made whistleblowers disappear and refused to hand over virus samples so the West could make a vaccine,\'&#8221; he reported.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The mainstream media and social media also quickly began parroting the &#8216;official&#8217; story line,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Social media companies suspended the accounts of whoever might have had a different opinion and some were even canceled.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now a lab-leak is considered the most likely source of the worldwide death campaign.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine how different the 2020 presidential election might have been if the debate was how the world would have held the CCP accountable for the leak and coverup of COVID from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,&#8221; Hoekstra pointed out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Or how about the Hunter Biden laptop cover-up? Once again, On October 14, 2020, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, a critical story of possible extensive influence-peddling with senior intelligence officers in the CCP, Russia and Ukraine by the son of a presidential candidate. The contents of the laptop raised questions that the candidate at the time, Vice President Joe Biden, could be compromised. The entire subject was decisively pushed aside, along with the potential threat to national security that such an eventuality might entail,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Discussion of Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop with its reportedly incriminating information about the Biden family business dealings with the CCP, Russia, and other actors in what appeared to be a model of pay-for-play, was instantly shut down. Fifty-one former government intelligence officials , who we now know were perfectly well aware that the laptop was real – the FBI had been holding it for months – wrote a letter describing the contents of the laptop as having &#8216;all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation&#8217; designed to damage Joe Biden,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>But those claims were false.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once again, the leadership at the FBI, the media, social media, and former government officials had developed a hoax to damage their political opposition and the people who supported it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And importantly, there&#8217;s Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s Jan. 6, committee, which Hoekstra called a &#8220;one-sided investigative body, sometimes called &#8216;the third (attempted) impeachment.&#8217; The committee appears to have been put in place to stop Trump from running for office again. Before the proceeding even began, its outcome was predetermined: Trump was to be found guilty of – something,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Significantly, it has allowed only anti-Trump testimony, and even has refused to question Pelosi, who turned down offers of additional troops to protect the Capitol that day.</p>\n<p>Hoekstra delivered his verdict, &#8220;The media, social media, government officials and others have been complicit in undermining our rule of law and possibly even subverting an election.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

Actually, there have been claims that those accusations were planted in the media by the Biden administration, and that FBI agents actually were there planting evidence and installing bugging devices, among other accusations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The FBI raid on Trump’s home isn’t just about prosecuting the former president for Jan. 6, it’s about fixing the next presidential election,&#8221; Davidson explained. &#8220;The news cycle this week has been understandably dominated by the FBI’s raid on former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where armed agents were supposedly looking for classified documents the FBI believes were improperly removed from the White House at the end of Trump’s term, in violation of federal law.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But he said the raid is just part of a larger scheme: &#8220;The rigging of the 2024 presidential election.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 2020 results weren&#8217;t stolen &#8220;so much as rigged months in advance to give Joe Biden an advantage that all but guaranteed his victory, the 2024 election is being rigged to ensure that Trump either cannot run or, if he does run, cannot win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>About that FBI operation, reportedly concerning documents that Trump already was cooperating with authorities to sort through, &#8220;No serious person believes that a documents dispute was the real purpose of the raid. The idea that the FBI would search the home of a former president and potential 2024 GOP candidate over an ongoing (and not uncommon) disagreement over presidential records with the National Archives is absurd on its face.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That &#8220;makes zero sense,&#8221; he confirmed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As some expert observers have pointed out, including my colleague Margot Cleveland, a far more plausible explanation is that the FBI was perhaps on a fishing expedition, looking for evidence that could implicate Trump in the Jan. 6 riot. It’s no secret that Democrats and the Jan. 6 Committee want Garland to charge Trump with &#8216;seditious conspiracy&#8217; in hopes of making it impossible for Trump to run in 2024. In that case, a documents dispute with the National Archives would be nothing more than a flimsy pretext to get into Trump’s residence and look for incriminating evidence related to Jan. 6,&#8221; Davidson said.</p>\n<p>But the raid, and associated &#8220;schemes,&#8221; are just part of the Democrats&#8217; current agenda, he warned, as a backup &#8220;just in case Trump escapes indictment…&#8221; over Jan. 6.</p>\n<p>This time part of the rigging is Twitter&#8217;s plan to begin shutting down &#8220;misleading&#8221; election claims when it wants to.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And what <i>that</i> means, in light of Twitter’s past behavior around election time, is that anyone who questions the voting processes or outcomes, however justifiably and no matter what irregularities are afoot, will be shut down by Twitter,&#8221; Davidson noted.</p>\n<p>The targets, he pointed, will be &#8220;Trump voters who believe, rightly, that the 2020 election was riddled with irregularities, last-minute changes to voting rules, and absentee ballot fraud.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So anyone with concerns about &#8220;universal absentee voting, ballot harvesting, remote ballot drop boxes, loose voter ID rules, or any other Democrat-favored policies that are known to make elections less secure,&#8221; will hear &#8220;shut up&#8221; from Twitter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because Democrats plan to run the same play in 2024 they ran in 2020, and their allies in Big Tech don’t want anyone pointing it out,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>It is ironic, he noted, that Twitter itself was &#8220;perhaps the single greatest source of disinformation in the 2020 election. By quashing the New York Post’s valid and verified Hunter Biden laptop story just weeks before the election, and then locking the Post’s account (along with some people who tried to tweet the Post’s reporting on the laptop, including White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany), Twitter arguably tipped the balance of the election.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That story documented the scheming of the Biden family cartel to make money in foreign nations, including some that are considered enemies of the United States.</p>\n<p>One developing scandal, he said, is a voter-roll management system used in 31 states and D.C. that is sharing voter data with the Mark Zuckerberg-funded Center for Election Innovation and Research.</p>\n<p>That, he said, is one of two groups Zuckerberg used during the 2020 races to send $420 million to local elections officials to influence to results for Biden.</p>\n<p>His report said the real purpose appears to be &#8220;to boost Democrat voter turnout by forwarding state voter roll data, including records from unregistered voters, to CEIR.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He warned, &#8220;Understand that the same powerful people, companies, and nonprofits that conspired to rig the 2020 election are right now rigging the 2024 election, using many of the same tactics.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/06/2020-election-rigged-senior-legal-correspondent-confirms/\">Cleveland&#8217;s analysis</a> pointed out the influence that &#8220;rigged&#8221; 2020 &#8220;with every dollar of Zuck Bucks designed to get out the Democrat vote.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The election was rigged when Georgia rendered the election code’s mandate of signature verifications inoperable and the state court delayed a hearing on Trump’s challenge to the Georgia outcome until after the vote certification, thereby ignoring evidence that more than 35,000 illegal votes were included in the state’s tally – more than enough to require a court to throw out the election.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What is known about the 2020 election is that the results, almost without doubt, were influenced by the $420 million in Mark Zuckerberg money that he handed out to mostly leftist elections officials, who often used it for get-out-the-vote efforts in Democrat strongholds. That money was distributed outside the channels of any regulation that normally applies to political campaign spending.</p>\n<p>Further, the legacy and social media corporations cooperated in suppressing accurate, but very damaging, reporting about Joe Biden, his son Hunter and the family&#8217;s international business schemes just days before the election.</p>\n<p>Analysts have concluded that either of those actions alone could have pushed the election results into the Biden column.</p>\n<p>Cleveland said rigging was evident &#8220;when the press refused to bare the secret that Hunter Biden provided his dad, the &#8216;Big Guy,&#8217; a 10 percent kickback from the various millions made in a pay-to-play scandal,&#8221; &#8220;when Twitter blocked the New York Post’s reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop and the material uncovered from its hard drive and then when every elite media outlet ignored the story,&#8221; &#8220;When the same legacy and social media outlets that censored the explosive Joe Biden scandal instead promoted the false claim that the Post’s reporting was Russian disinformation&#8221; and &#8220;when the lapdog media outlets pantingly ran the Russia disinformation cover story to protect Joe Biden, knowing Attorney General William Barr’s Department of Justice would not leak the truth, but would instead preserve its independence and remain silent while the corrupt press lied to the American public.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism. Countless LGBT activists, including many public-school teachers, have taken to proselytizing the new transgender salvation to America’s children, both on social media and within the schools themselves. Even Biden’s far-left Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fully supports taxpayer-funded amputations of healthy body parts of these vulnerable children, declaring ghoulishly, “We should help those have the life-affirming care that they need.” The result? Untold numbers of America’s kids are being led into lives of not just unending conflict, confusion, suffering, deformity and disability, but far too often – as multiple studies prove – suicide. The whole unbelievable story – including the underlying reasons, almost entirely unreported elsewhere, for what amounts to the most massive child sexual abuse campaign in American history – is explored as never before in the July issue of WND’s critically acclaimed Whistleblower magazine, titled “<a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/\">WHAT’S REALLY BEHIND THE TRANSGENDER CRAZE?</a>”</i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.
