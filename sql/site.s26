In shades reminiscent of former United States President Donald Trump, Democrats <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/578227-virginia-democrats-sue-usps-for-delays-that-threaten-to-disenfranchise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allege</a> that up to 300,000 mail-in ballots may be impacted by a slow-down in mail handling. Unlike Trump, however, they are not waiting until after the election to file legal action claiming election irregularities.</p>\n<p>“Currently, based on data from the Virginia Department of Elections, 28 percent of requested absentee ballots statewide have remained outstanding with the Post Office for more than three weeks after the date they were requested and delivered to the Postal Service by general registrars for delivery,” wrote party lawyers.</p>\n<p>The Democrats’ Oct. 22 suit asks the federal court to order the Post Office to prioritize and expedite delivery of election-related mail and deliver all election mail in Virginia no later than three days after being received by the Post Office. They also demand that all election mail in Albermarle, James City, and Portsmouth Counties be processed within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs’ lawyers <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/oct/25/virginia-democrats-file-lawsuit-against-us-postal-/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allege</a> there are thousands of ballots sitting unscanned in Post Offices in those three counties. “These unscanned ballots constituted more than a quarter — and, in the case of Albermarle, nearly half — of all ballots that voters in those jurisdictions had requested, and that the County Registrars had delivered to the postal facilities,” said plaintiff attorney Jeffrey Breit.</p>\n<p>Post Office officials insist no such delays have occurred, and CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/29/politics/usps-virginia-democrats-lawsuit/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> Friday that it has agreed to provide daily election mail reports to all concerned parties.</p>\n<p>“The Postal Service has a robust and tested process for the proper handling and timely delivery of Election Mail. Our Election Mail processes and procedures are fully operational in Virginia,” Post Office public relations representative Martha Johnson <a href=\"https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/usps-lawsuit-democrats-election/291-74e02a5b-2503-44f0-bde3-4276d09caac2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a> in an email. “We are not aware of any processing delays of any ballots within our facilities nor any ballot delivery delays, and we have fully communicated this information to election officials.”</p>\n<p>“Throughout the election cycle we work closely with state and local election officials and have been addressing any concerns that they raise. Daily sweeps are being conducted in all our Virginia facilities,” she added.</p>\n<p>Virginia absentee ballots must be postmarked on or before Election Day to be counted. This year’s Election Day is Tuesday, November 2. All mailed ballots must be received by the general registrar’s office by noon Friday.</p>\n<p>A CNN political fact-check article <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/factsfirst/politics/factcheck_33b225f3-5d02-4f2c-abca-41e694c90b4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blasted</a> Trump’s claims of election irregularities due to mail-in ballots: “Those claims are false.

Then more than a dozen states followed with similar legal action. In all, 19 states are asking the Judicial Branch to nullify the president’s executive order, which has been derisively referred to as “jabs for jobs.”</p>\n<p>One lawsuit, <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/show_temp-pl.pdf?sfvrsn=950657f1_2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">filed</a> in a Missouri federal district court, involves Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.

Are you kidding me?”</p>\n<p>President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued</a> an executive order that requires almost all federal employees and contractors to get vaccinated against Covid-19 or they will get fired or suspended. The order, effective on Dec. 8, does not allow testing as an option for people who do not want to get vaccinated.</p>\n<p>Religious and medical exemptions from vaccination may be granted, according to the executive order, but while those requests are pending, a Federal District Court Judge <a href=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/judge-blocks-biden-admin-from-firing-unvaccinated-employees-with-pending-religious-exemptions-biden-admin-responds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued</a> a restraining order on Thursday to prevent federal employees from being fired for not yet complying with the vaccine mandate. In that lawsuit, filed last month, Biden and members of his administration were sued by 20 plaintiffs over his Sept. 9 executive order requiring vaccines for all federal employees and contractors.</p>\n<p>All the state lawsuits argue that the mandate violates federal procurement law and is an overreach of federal power. The states believe Biden’s vaccine mandate violates the principle of state sovereignty enumerated by the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it uses federal spending to coerce the states. Finally, they point out the federal government did not properly allow for 60 days of public comment.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the failure to follow proper procedure may be the weakest point and yet the one allows the Supreme Court to invalidate Biden’s executive order without ruling on the merits of a federal vaccine mandate. That would mirror the court’s answer to Democrat challenges to former President Donald Trump’s executive order ending DACA. The court ruled Trump’s order not lawful because the administration did not properly explain why they were overturning former President Barack Obama’s executive order before issuing the order.</p>\n<p>Texans are as fired up about vaccine mandates as residents of the Sunshine State.</p>\n<p>“The Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed its disdain for Americans who choose not to get a vaccine, and it has committed repeated and abusive federal overreach to force upon Americans something they do not want,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement Friday. “The federal government does not have the ability to strip individuals of their choice to get a vaccine or not. If the President thinks his patience is wearing thin, he is clearly underestimating the lack of patience from Texans whose rights he is infringing.”</p>\n<p>The Texas legal response to Biden’s vaccine mandate supplements an executive order issued by Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) that forbids any entity from mandating vaccines for Texans.</p>\n<p>Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson are leading a ten-state coalition in a lawsuit that calls President Biden’s mandate “unconstitutional, unlawful, and unwise.”</p>\n<p>“If the federal government attempts to unconstitutionally exert its will and force federal contractors to mandate vaccinations, the workforce and businesses could be decimated, further exacerbating the supply chain and workforce crises,” Schmitt, a Republican, <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/home/news/2021/10/29/missouri-attorney-general-leads-10-state-coalition-in-filing-suit-to-halt-vaccine-mandate-for-federal-contractors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>. “The federal government should not be mandating vaccinations, and that’s why we filed suit today—to halt this illegal, unconstitutional action.”</p>\n<p>Georgia is leading the other multi-party suit opposing the “jabs for jobs” order.</p>\n<p>“In addition to being an unlawful and unconstitutional overreach, this vaccine mandate on federal contractors will only further divide Americans and hamstring our economy,” Governor Brian Kemp (R-GA) <a href=\"https://madmimi.com/p/72de031?pact=157852-165289856-13401774837-2441590c80ab95efc23e5b1bac90adbed87e02f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a> in a statement released Friday. “Polling shows 70 percent of unvaccinated Americans say they would quit their jobs if their company required the Covid-19 vaccine.

And all Glenn Youngkin has done in this campaign is run down Virginia, run down our education system, run down our economy.”</p>\r\n<p>“And when you think of this right now on Critical Race Theory, Chuck, it’s not taught so all you’re doing is pitting parents against parents, parents against teachers, and they’re using children as political pawns,” McAuliffe said.</p>\r\n<p>The Manhattan Institute’s Chris Rufo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1454467134067642377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highlighted</a> several <a href=\"https://christopherrufo.com/mcaullifes-crt-lie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documents</a> – one dating back to when McAuliffe ran the state from 2014 to 2018 – on the Virginia Department of Education’s website featuring CRT.

These same reports state that Harris is eager to distance herself from President Joe Biden, who she views as a sinking ship. Conservative media personality Jack Posobiec, who has multiple reliable sources inside the White House, claimed that “Kamala Harris is referring to Joe Biden as the ‘Titanic’ behind his back and that Dr. Jill Biden was asking if it was possible to remove a sitting VP over the past weekend.” There has long been rumored to be no love lost between Jill and Harris. During the Democratic primary presidential debates in 2019, Harris attacked Biden for his record opposing federally mandated interracial busing to desegregate schools. “That little girl was me!” Harris told him in a cutting moment that quickly went viral. Days later, during a phone call with reporters, Jill is said to have cussed out Harris for attacking her husband in this way. “With what he cares about, what he fights for, what he’s committed to, you get up there and call him a racist without basis? Go f–k yourself,” Jill allegedly said, according to an account published by Politico. “She couldn’t bear to watch a woman who called herself a friend of her son’s — although Beau was not her biological child, she’d raised him his entire life as if he were — try to tear her husband down, to score a point at a debate,” Politico’s Edward-Isaac Dovere claimed. When asked for comment on these reports, Jill’s spokesperson said, “Many books will be written on the 2020 campaign, with countless retellings of events — some accurate, some inaccurate. The first lady and her team do not plan to comment on any of them.” When Jill herself was asked about the reports back in May, she replied, “My goodness, that was two years ago. We have moved on from that,” according to Insider. Judging by the latest reports coming in about Jill and Harris, however, it seems that they most certainly have not moved on. Biden was also infuriated by the attack, as he reportedly turned to fellow candidate Pete Buttigieg on the debate stage afterward and said, “That was some f–king bullshit.” Since Biden took office, Buttigieg has been named as his transportation secretary. Despite her attack on Biden, Harris was named as his Vice President.

('91', '467', 'In Maine, a push to enumerate a constitutional right to food', 'in-maine-a-push-to-enumerate-a-constitutional-right-to-food', '<p>Voters in Maine will decide on Election Day whether to amend the state’s constitution to recognize an unalienable right to grow, harvest and eat the foods of their choice. Detractors worry the amendment creates a Pandora’s box.</p>', '<div class=\"article-container\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>(CN) — For Maine state Representative Billy Bob Faulkingham, amending the state Constitution to recognize a constitutional right to food is just common sense.</p>\n<p>“In the last decade I think everybody, no matter where you are in the country, has probably seen an expansion of the farmers\' markets and such because people want to get that food closer to home, healthier food, get away from the big corporate producers,” said Faulkingham, a fifth-generation lobsterman who has captained a lobster boat since he was 15.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a resolution he helped introduce into the legislature, Maine voters will decide on Election Day whether to become the first state to codify a right to food in their state Constitution.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/pdf/11-21citizensguide.pdf\">proposed amendment</a> says individuals have a right to consume food of their own choosing, which includes saving seeds and the ability to grow, raise and harvest that food as long as private property rights and natural resources are not abused in the process.</p>\n<p>The spending to launch campaigns surrounding this ballot question has been miniscule, comparable to a brisk town-wide election. Newspaper op-eds have been published and some radio spots have aired across the state. It is unlike the millions spent on another question posed to Maine voters this year over whether to ban construction of electrical transmission lines across a portion of the state.</p>\n<p>But unlike the transmission line question, proponents and skeptics of Maine’s right to food initiative believe the issue may crop up in other states. Indeed, Washington and West Virginia have begun to consider it.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the question has shaken the stereotypical political alliances. Faulkingham, a Republican, has pushed for the bill with Senator Craig Hickman, a Democrat who runs an organic farm. The coalition opposing the adoption of the amendment include animal rights groups and agricultural associations.</p>\n<p>Detractors say the amendment’s language is too vague and could lead to unintended consequences for how animals are raised and how food safety is enforced in the state.</p>\n<p>According to Faulkingham, the proposed right to food amendment grew out of a grassroots food sovereignty movement.</p>\n<p>Around the time Faulkingham began paying attention to the movement, years before he entered the legislature in 2018, the state had cracked down on a Maine farmer who it said was not licensed to sell raw milk.</p>\n<p>“It definitely struck me the wrong way… what it seemed like the government was doing to him,” Faulkingham said.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the Maine Supreme Court ruled against Dan Brown, a farmer who had sold raw milk without a distributor\'s license and argued a town ordinance exempted him from the state requirements regarding the labeling of his milk when he sold it from a farmers’ market and a stand.</p>\n<p>The Maine Supreme Court took up the matter and ruled against Brown, saying the municipal exemption only applied to inspection and licensing requirements at the local level.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the legislature passed the <a href=\"https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/7/title7ch8-F.pdf\">Maine Food Sovereignty Act</a> that allowed towns to pass ordinances that prevented state food laws from applying to producer-to-consumer purchases of food.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-container\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>The question now before Maine voters, Faulkingham said, will codify an individual right, similar to that of the Maine’s right to bear arms: the <a href=\"https://www.maine.gov/legis/const/\">Constitution’s language</a> says it’s a right that cannot be questioned but it also comes with restrictions.</p>\n<p>Little will change if the amendment passes, Faulkingham said, but it would help promote self-sufficiency in the land with deep farming, hunting and fishing traditions.</p>\n<p>For now, the right to food is a preventative one, designed to be a bulwark against government infringement, the lawmaker said, though he does not see a lot of infringement currently.</p>\n<p>“We worry about that in the future,” Faulkingham said. “And we think that a constitutional right, definitely gives some people some standing when it comes to those sorts of things.”</p>\n<p>Denisse Cordova Montes, professor at the University of Miami, said Maine is leading the nation in asking its voters about enshrining a right to food, a right that’s recognized internationally, from constitutions of various countries to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>\n<p>Cordova Montes, a human rights lawyer who has worked on the right to food, said the right is a holistic one that encompasses consuming sustenance with dignity. Food, Cordova Montes said, should be nutritionally adequate whether the individual is a baby or a pregnant mother, and accessible to the person who is seeking to grow their own food and the person living in a food desert, which are communities far away from a grocery store where they could obtain healthy food. </p>\n<p>“By including it in the Constitution, it will result in, I think, the government of Maine taking it into account when it comes to policy planning … It just becomes a priority in the state,” Cordova Montes said.</p>\n<p>In April, Cordova Montes and an intern with the University of Miamai School of Law’s Human Rights Clinic issued a <a href=\"https://miami.app.box.com/s/oatj0isyglmilyetwz7kgpuri2arwleh\">legal memo</a> to the Maine Attorney General arguing the right to food resolution being considered in the legislature did not include a right to commercially produce and save seeds, which allowed the state to continue to regulate seeds for diseases and blight.</p>\n<p>Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action said it has only been in the last few years that some states have banned the use of intensive confinement of animals on large commercial farms. Over the years, he has worked on ballot initiatives in states such as Massachusetts and California to ban extreme confinement and fought ballot measures in places such as Oklahoma which considered right-to-farm questions that would have prevented the prohibition on such confinement. </p>\n<p>Pacelle said he’s concerned about copycat resolutions in other states and that could be used to roll back animal welfare protections. The right-to-food amendment seems to have grown from Maine food sovereignty movement, but its language he sees to be a combination of right-to-farm and a right-to-hunt resolutions.</p>\n<p>“We all think that we should have access to food and it should be wholesome and it should be quality food, but the measure doesn\'t do anything to advance that. I mean, it\'s just not clear that the rhetoric aligns with the actual language of the provision,” Pacelle said.</p>\n<p>Beth Gallie, president of the Maine Animal Coalition, says amending the constitution should be rare and already the constitution says whatever rights are not enumerated in the document are reserved for the people.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-container\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>“If everyone starts putting their rights into the Constitution, it\'s like a 100-page document. No, it\'s not the way to go,” Gallie said.</p>\n<p>In previous years, the legislature considered other versions of the right to food amendment. This version, Gallie said, does not raise as many red flags but there are still concerns. She also worries that creating a constitutional right and questions surrounding it would be left in the hands of the state’s judges.  </p>\n<p>But Scott Bloomberg, a law professor who teaches constitutional law at Maine University School of Law, said if the Maine courts interpret the right, they will probably look to evidence about what the voters thought they were enacting, if it’s passed.</p>\n<p>The courts are unlikely to conclude that the right obligates the government to provide food to the state’s residents, but nevertheless, they will “have to grapple with what is the scope of the right and what kind of laws intrude on the right,” Bloomberg said.</p>\n<p>But 100 years into the future? Courts could take a more expansive reading, Bloomberg said.</p>\n<p>“If this is really a response to a future problem, it is really hard to assess what a court is going to make of it and when is somebody going to challenge a law, under this amendment,” Bloomberg said.</p>\n<p>Julie Smith, executive director of the Maine Farm Bureau Association, said the vague language of the proposed amendment could lead to unintended consequences for food safety. The kind of foods Maine farmers produce is varied, said Smith, from wild blueberries, a diverse number of vegetables and “some of the best tasting milk in the whole United States.”</p>\n<p>The bureau supports customers buying raw milk, Smith said, but licensing is important.</p>\n<p>“You can’t see bacteria,” Smith said. “There’s no way to know whether your milk is safe or not for consumption unless you test it.”</p>\n<p>But a court could decide, under the proposed amendment, that an individual who got sick drinking uninspected milk chose to buy that milk. According to Smith, the question becomes whether the state had a right to inspect the dairy farmer to see if, say, the farm’s water source is contaminated.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Smith said it could affect hunting and fishing laws, hampering efforts to notify individuals digging for clams that there’s a red tide, for instance.</p>\n<p>And while the question before voters over the transmission lines attracted more dollars than the right to food question, Smith said the latter is the more important issue.</p>\n<p>“This absolutely impacts every single person in the state of Maine and it impacts their future,” Smith said. “A transmission line, you know what? You can take it down and the forest can regrow. You take away food safety, people die.”</p>\n<p>There has been little polling on this issue. Whether voters see this as a common-sense enshrinement of a right to self-sufficiency or they see unintended effects to the state’s animals and food safety, those involved in the issue will find out on Election Day if the voters decide it’s a bite they want to take.</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-button-embed\"><a class=\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-button-error\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jcksndnl\" data-size=\"large\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-twitter-extracted-i1635724993206739412=\"true\">Follow @jcksndnl</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div id=\"email-subscribers\">Source:  <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/in-maine-a-push-to-enumerate-a-constitutional-right-to-food/\">https://www.courthousenews.com/in-maine-a-push-to-enumerate-a-constitutional-right-to-food/</a> </div>\n</div>\n</div>', '1', '114', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/AP20331588456867-1880x1254.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '4', '9', '', '', '1', '41', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

Its vaccine was previously allowed for emergency use only in kids ages 12 and up.</p>\n<p>“Vaccinating younger children against Covid-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,” Woodcock said. “Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.”</p>\n<p>Peter Marks, who heads the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, emphasized that the decision was based on science. </p>\n<p>“We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization,” Marks said.</p>\n<p>Pfizer is now just waiting for approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin distributing doses to up to 28 million elementary-age Americans. The agency’s advisers are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the children’s vaccine and determine which subsets of the 5-to-11 population should receive it. A decision by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky is expected after the meeting.</p>\n<p>Assuming the CDC approves the jab for youngsters, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, has said the shots could be available early next month.</p>\n<p>“If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it\'s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci said on ABC\'s \"This Week\" on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Like adults, children will receive two shots, three weeks apart. The kid-size dose is one-third of the adult dose.</p>\n<p>Pfizer and its partner BioNTech reported earlier this month that trial results show its vaccine is more than <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/pfizer-says-kid-size-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-are-about-91-effective/\">90% effective</a> in 5- to 11-year-olds, based on a study of more than 2,200 children.</p>\n<p>In anticipation of approval, White House officials have indicated they are logistically <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/white-house-unveils-plan-to-vaccinate-young-kids-against-covid/\">ready to hit the ground running</a>. </p>\n<p>“Should the FDA and CDC authorize the vaccine, we will be ready to get shots in arms,” White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said during a news briefing last week. Zients emphasized the administration’s forward planning, ahead of regulatory approval, was an effort to be ready immediately operationally when a decision is made, in stark contrast to the lagging response time when adult vaccines were rolled out under former President Donald Trump late last year. </p>\n<p>The U.S. has enough doses to cover the millions of kids in the younger age group, federal officials <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/20/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-update-on-operational-planning-for-covid-19-vaccinations-for-kids-ages-5-11/\">said</a>, and will deploy supplies like smaller needles to the doctors and community health centers that need them. </p>\n<p>The vials of the diluted doses for children will have an orange cap to differentiate them from the adults’ purple-capped vials, Pfizer representatives told the FDA advisory panel on Tuesday, and the shipping containers will also be distinct. </p>\n<p>Following the anticipated authorization by regulators, schools will face a decision on whether to make vaccines for kids mandatory. Children ages 5 to 11 years old account for 40% of all pediatric Covid-19 cases, and 9% of overall cases. Experts <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/fda-advisers-recommend-pfizer-vaccine-for-kids-5-and-up/\">who addressed the FDA panel</a> weighing approval of the children’s vaccine pointed out that, since kids are less likely to show symptoms of Covid-19, their rates of contracting the illness are probably underreported. </p>\n<p>Vaccine mandates for adults — including teachers, health care workers and public employees — have been the target of numerous lawsuits continuing to play out in federal court. </p>\n<p>In New York City, a group of teachers’ attempt to take down the city’s mandatory vaccine policy <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/appeals-court-keeps-nyc-teacher-vaccine-mandate-in-effect/\">flopped at the Second Circuit</a>.</p>\n<p>While some parents are expected to be eager to vaccinate their children before holiday gatherings and cold and flu season, polling has indicated that others may not be in any rush—or even interested. Survey results published Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-2021/\">about 25% of parents polled</a> in October would vaccinate their children “right away,” while the rest were divvied up between waiting to see how the vaccine works and “definitely” not getting their children vaccinated.</p>\n<p>Moderna’s vaccine is currently still being studied in young children while both Pfizer and Moderna continue trials of shots for babies and children under 5.</p>\n<p>Other countries <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/china-to-start-vaccinating-children-to-age-3-as-cases-spread/\">like China</a> have already begun vaccinating children under 12.

In filings with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the Duke of York called Giuffre’s “baseless” lawsuit an effort to “achieve another payday” from her accusations against the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.</p>\n<div class=\"ev-meter-content\">\n<p>Andrew, 61, who is Queen Elizabeth’s second son, also said he was released from liability under a 2009 settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein, a registered sex offender. He said that agreement covered “royalty,” among others, and that Epstein had insisted it cover “any and all persons” who Giuffre might sue.”Virginia Giuffre may well be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein, and nothing can excuse, nor fully capture, the abhorrence and gravity of Epstein’s monstrous behavior against Giuffre, if so,” Andrew’s lawyers wrote.</p>\n<p>“However, and without diminishing the harm suffered as a result of Epstein’s alleged misconduct, Prince Andrew never sexually abused or assaulted Giuffre,” they added. “He unequivocally denies Giuffre’s false allegations against him.</p>\n<p>“David Boies, a lawyer for Giuffre, said in a statement that Andrew’s bid to dismiss the lawsuit “fails to confront the serious allegations” it contained.</p>\n<p>He also said the settlement agreement “on its face” applies “at most” to people involved in underlying litigation in Florida, thereby excluding the prince. “Prince Andrew’s attempt now to use the 2009 release as a get out of jail free card shows how desperate he is to dodge and duck the facts of what he did,” Boies said. Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>\n<p><strong>CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE</strong></p>\n<p>Giuffre, 38, sued Andrew for unspecified damages in August, accusing him of forcing her to have sex at the London home of Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime Epstein associate. She also accused Andrew of abusing her at Epstein’s mansion in Manhattan, and on one of Epstein’s private islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p>In Friday’s filings, Andrew’s lawyers said Giuffre had already “purportedly received millions of dollars” from settling a 2015 defamation lawsuit against Maxwell, where according to court papers she had sought $50 million .The lawyers said they would also challenge a 2019 New York law that gave survivors of childhood sexual abuse a now-closed two-year window to sue their alleged abusers over conduct occurring many years or decades earlier.</p>\n<p>That law allowed Giuffre to pursue her case, but according to the lawyers deprived the prince of his due process rights under New York’s state constitution. The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, the state’s top law enforcer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Andrew has not been charged with crimes. He gave up many royal duties and lost support from charities and organizations after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he did not appear sympathetic toward Epstein’s victims.</p>\n<p>The next hearing in Giuffre’s lawsuit is set for Nov. 3.Giuffre was sued separately for $20 million on Thursday for allegedly defaming on Twitter an artist who has said she brought women to Epstein but denied being a recruiter. The artist, Rina Oh Amen, sued over tweets including that she “procured &amp; partook in the abuse of minors.” Amen called the tweets “maliciously false,” and said Epstein also abused her.</p>\n<div class=\"non-city-story-widget\">Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges for allegedly helping recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.

Pandemic restrictions also kept reporters and the public out of the courtroom during the sex-trafficking trial of music star R. Kelly.</p>\n<p>And in an Ohio courtroom, a federal judge relegated the press to an overflow room to listen to an audio feed for the trial of a Chinese national charged with trying to steal trade secrets from U.S. companies.</p>\n<p>A year-and-a-half into the coronavirus pandemic, courts across the U.S. are still grappling with how to balance public health concerns with the constitutional rights of a defendant and the public to have an open trial. There\'s no standard solution. Some courts are still functioning entirely virtually. Others are back in person. And many are allowing only limited public access.</p>\n<p>“This is a fundamental constitutional right that the public has — to have open courts and to be able to see what’s happening in real-time in a courtroom,” said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, which has prodded California courts to improve public access during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Covid-19 space constraints have led judges across the U.S. to exclude or limit public and media attendance at trials.</p>\n<p>During <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/r-kelly-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-trials-new-york-6fede99231f4d28257725391dae28ebd\">Kelly\'s trial, which concluded last month with his conviction</a>, a federal judge in New York barred the press and public from the courtroom because jurors were sitting six feet apart in the gallery normally used by observers. Onlookers could watch a live video feed in an overflow courtroom, but it offered no view of the jury and only limited images of the defendant, witnesses and exhibits. At one point, prosecutors played a recording that jurors listened to with headphones, with no audio available for the press and public.</p>\n<p>The judge rejected <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21090645-r-kelly-trial-media-letter\">a request by media groups</a>, including The Associated Press, to allow pool reporters in the courtroom for much of the trial, letting six reporters in only when the verdict was announced.</p>\n<p>A similar scenario played out last week in Ohio, where a federal judge cited the pandemic while keeping the public out of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-china-cincinnati-theft-espionage-71b6b102ffeae25d273794974829af28\">the courtroom for the trial of Yanjun Xu</a>, a Chinese official accused of trying of steal trade secrets from U.S. aviation and aerospace companies. There was no public access to jury selection. Audio of the trial was played for media in a conference room.</p>\n<p>Overflow rooms are better than nothing but often leave observers unable to see the full context of what\'s occurring, like the reaction of jurors as evidence is presented, said New York attorney Rachel Strom, who represented media in the R. Kelly case.</p>\n<p>\"We don’t know what we missed by not having someone actually in the courtroom,” Strom said.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-container\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>After the AP and other media filed legal motions, a Georgia judge granted just two media pool seats in the courtroom right before the start of jury selection <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ahmaud-arbery-social-media-georgia-media-racial-injustice-bafd1ce62feddc6879dd54b972c1cb3f\">in the trial of three white men charged with chasing and killing Arbery</a>. Graphic cellphone video of the 25-year-old Black man being shot sparked outrage nationally last year, and the trial is being closely watched as a referendum on how the legal system treats Black victims. The judge has since allowed a third reporter and a photographer into the courtroom.</p>\n<p>In another high-profile case, the press and public initially were allowed to listen remotely to court proceedings as pop star Britney Spears sought to end her father\'s conservatorship over her finances. But Los Angeles County Superior Court canceled the remote access after someone recorded a hearing, and the court refused to reinstate it <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britney-spears-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-los-angeles-8ed8d18ff75eee08fb58c5ddd4625f4f\">for a September hearing when Spears was freed </a>from her father\'s oversight. The court instead allowed more people into the courtroom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21090618-usa-today-court-filing-in-britney-spears-case\">USA Today recently asked the California Supreme Court</a> to order the restoration of remote audio for the public and media.</p>\n<p>“No one should have to risk their health to exercise their constitutional right of access by travelling to, and attending, court in person,” USA Today said in its court filing. It also suggested the remote audio program should continue “even when the pandemic ends.”</p>\n<p>The California request highlights how the pandemic has shifted expectations about what qualifies as public access.</p>\n<p>“As courts open back up, they should strongly consider keeping some amount of remote access available to the public,” said Lin Weeks, an attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.</p>\n<p>Many courts now are routinely using video conferencing in civil lawsuits, for bail proceedings in criminal cases and for family law disputes such as child-custody and divorce cases. Some also are using video conferencing to select jurors or to conduct entire jury trials.</p>\n<p>Court officials say the virtual proceedings have saved time and money for attorneys, jurors, litigants and defendants, who no longer have to travel to a courthouse, take extensive time off work or arrange child care. Courts also have seen fewer no-shows among those summoned to virtual jury pools and, as a result, greater diversity on juries.</p>\n<p>“It has been a lifeline as we’ve tried to keep the justice system moving during the pandemic, but it’s also been transformational,” said Sean O’Donnell, a superior court judge in King County, Washington, home of Seattle.</p>\n<p>King County judges have conducted about 700 online trials, including about 50 with jurors. During a trial that O’Donnell presided over last week, the judge, attorneys, witness and jurors appeared on a 20-tile Zoom screen that the public could view on YouTube. Two jurors sat in clothes closets. One participated from his vehicle. Another was chided by O’Donnell to remove his cat from the camera view. A witness testified from Oregon, a couple hundred miles away.</p>\n<p>Despite those oddities, the virtual trial progressed much like a regular trial, with attorneys taking turns questioning witnesses and evidentiary documents displayed on the screen for all to see. There even were periodic breaks where participants stood up and stretched.</p>\n<p>Conducting the trial virtually also freed up space at the courthouse. To accommodate social distancing, in-person trials are using as many as three separate courtrooms — one for the actual trial, a second for the public to view it remotely and a third for the jury to use during breaks and deliberations, O’Donnell said.</p>\n<p>Across Hawaii\'s chain of islands, the ability to observe courts virtually has increased public access during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>John Burnett, a reporter for the Hawaii Tribune-Herald, wasn\'t able to cover state Supreme Court or U.S. District Court proceedings before the pandemic because it required a 50-minute plane ride from Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, where his newspaper is based, to Honolulu on the island of Oahu.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>NEW YORK (AP) — A judge on Thursday rejected British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell’s bid to block the public and news media from jury selection in her New York City trial on charges she recruited teenage girls for financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan said the press and public will be allowed to view the selection proceedings next month via video feeds to an overflow courtroom and a courthouse press room. She said two pool reporters will be let into the courtroom as she questions prospective jurors.</p>\n<p>In deciding on the issue, Nathan said she strove to balance the public’s right to access court proceedings with health measures, such as adding extra space between parties, that have been put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a journalist consortium, and more than a dozen news organizations had written to the judge Wednesday opposing the defense’s request to select jurors in secret.</p>\n<p>“We’re all aware that there’s been intense media and public interest in this case. ... These procedures will ensure the First Amendment rights to public access as is necessary and required by law,” Nathan said on a pretrial conference call.</p>\n<p>Nathan also denied a defense request to prevent the public from seeing the blank questionnaire that will be given to about 600 people who will be summoned as prospective jurors in the high-profile case.</p>\n<p>The selection of 12 primary jurors and six alternates is scheduled to begin Nov. 4, with opening statements set for Nov. 29. In selecting primary jurors, the defense will have 10 peremptory challenges and the prosecution will have six, Nathan said. For alternates, each side will get three challenges.</p>\n<p>Maxwell’s lawyers argued for questioning prospective jurors behind closed doors because they may be asked to divulge sensitive information, such as if they have been sexually abused. Nathan said she would make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to “ensure juror candor and project juror privacy.”</p>\n<p>Maxwell lawyer Bobbi Sternheim said letting the public see the blank version of the questionnaire, which is used to screen the jury pool for biases, hardships, personal connections and awareness of the case, will lead to people lying their way into the jury process. She equated it to a “take-home exam” in which jurors could fill in answers they think will best position them to be selected.</p>\n<p>Nathan, who will conduct one-on-one follow-up questioning Nov. 16-19 with prospective jurors who survive the questionnaire phase, responded: “If a juror is going to lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that out. And the fact of this questionnaire being publicly documented is not going to increase or decrease any such likelihood.”</p>\n<p>Maxwell, whose father was a British newspaper baron, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ny-state-wire-trials-ghislaine-maxwell-05c7d66a0885da88021a908615c211ba\">has pleaded not guilty</a> to charges that she recruited teenage girls from 1994 to 2004 for Epstein to sexually abuse during encounters that sometimes were described as sexualized massages. A revised indictment filed in March included allegations she groomed a 14-year-old girl to recruit other young females in return for cash.</p>\n<p>Epstein killed himself at a Manhattan federal lockup in August 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.</p>\n<p>Maxwell, 59, joined the conference call Thursday from an empty room at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she has been held since her July 2020 arrest. She didn’t say much, except to complain about the call’s wonky connection and to assure the judge she was still on the line when another communications mishap occurred.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p><em>By MICHAEL R.

The Tsarnaevs were on the run for days after the attacks, a manhunt that end with authorities apprehending an injured Dzhokhar from a boat parked on one family\'s lawn. Tamerlan had been killed, run over by a stolen SUV driven by Dzhokhar, after the brothers were nearly apprehended in an earlier confrontation, but not before they gunned down a fourth victim, a young man on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police force.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/marathon-bombers-vacated-death-sentence-to-face-scotus-scrutiny/\">case before the court</a> concerns only the legal process that sentenced Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death. </p>\n<p>“No matter what this Court decides, respondent will at a minimum spend the rest of his life in prison for the horrific crimes he committed,” Kannon Shanmugam wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tsarnaev-judges-prosecutors-amicus.pdf\">brief</a> from retired federal judges and former federal prosecutors on Tsarnaev\'s behalf. “Instead, this case is about the process of empaneling the jury that recommended respondent’s death sentence, in a situation where pretrial publicity was \'unrivaled in American legal history.\'\"</p>\n<p>The First Circuit <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/first-circuit-overturns-boston-marathon-bombers-death-sentence/\">overturned</a> Tsarnaev’s death sentence in 2020, remanding the case for a new penalty trial, on the basis of evidence that the government had failed to properly vet jurors. The court also reversed three of Tsarnaev’s capital convictions for carrying a firearm during a crime of violence.</p>\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/16-6001P-01A.pdf\">2-1 decision</a>, the appeals court said Dzhokhar\'s sentencing conflicted with precedent it decided in the 1968 case <em>Patriarca v. United States</em>, which involved the screening of jurors about pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p>“The district court refused to ask prospective jurors a question routinely asked in high-profile cases: what they remembered hearing about the case,” Ginger Anders, the attorney representing Tsarnaev, said in a <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tsarnaev-brief.pdf\">brief</a>. “If there were ever a case in which jurors needed to be asked that question, it is this one.” </p>\n<p>In the government\'s petition meanwhile, it dismisses <em>Patriarca</em> as a “half-century-old decision” and one that has no application here as the First Circuit found no evidence of juror bias. </p>\n<p>“A criminal defendant is entitled to trial \'by an impartial jury,\' the <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tsarnaev-petition.pdf\">government’s 400-plus-page petition</a> states. \"But \'juror <em>impartiality</em> *** does not require <em>ignorance</em>.\'” (Emphasis and asterisks in original.)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-container\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed an amicus brief in this case as well. Kent Scheidegger, the foundation\'s legal director, said the courts have a duty to take into account what kind of publicity is prejudicial.</p>\n<p>“In deciding whether the defendant committed the crime or not, the particular horror of the crime is irrelevant,” Scheidegger said in a phone interview. “How horrible a crime is has nothing to do with who did it. So, that kind of publicity can be prejudicial on the issue of guilt, but on the issue of penalty, how horrible the crime is is central and proper to the correct decision. So evidence that is prejudicial for question of guilt is not prejudicial for requesting a penalty.” </p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure><img class=\"lazyloaded\" src=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AP20213705191220-1280x720.jpg\" data-ll-status=\"loaded\" />\n<figcaption>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on April 19, 2013, after his arrest in connection to the Boston Marathon bombing attack four days earlier that killed three people and injured more than 260. (FBI via AP)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In addition to the issue of juror bias, the First Circuit questioned the exclusion of an allegation that Tamerlan had been the perpetrator of an unsolved murder that occurred in Waltham, Massachusetts, on Sept. 11, 2011: three drug dealers were found with slit throats on the 10-year anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Shortly after the marathon bombing, as authorities interviewed associates of the suspects, Tamerlan\'s friend, Ibragim Todashev, said it was Tamerlan who slit the men\'s throats. As Todashev wrote out his confession to the murders, however, he attacked the agents, one of whom shot and killed him. </p>\n<p>The government obtained its search warrant for Tamerlan’s car based on Todashev’s claims, but they did not present the evidence to the jury at Dzhokhar\'s trial on the basis that the confession was unreliable, that its exclusion would be harmless, and it was possible the issue would confuse the jury. </p>\n<p>“Even if jurors found the Waltham evidence credible, Tamerlan’s alleged commission of independent crimes almost two years before the bombing had no reasonable prospect of altering the jury’s recommendation that respondent receive the death penalty for his own acts of terrorism,” the government’s brief states. </p>\n<p>For Tsarnaev’s attorney, however, the Waltham murder evidence could have been used to show that Tamerlan radicalized his younger brother. </p>\n<p>“Having successfully excluded this powerful corroboration of Tamerlan’s history of extremist violence, the government was free to belittle the defense’s mitigation theory,” Anders said in the brief. “Prosecutors told jurors that Tamerlan was merely “bossy,” that Dzhokhar radicalized on his own, and that Tamerlan was able to act on his extremist views only when Dzhokhar joined him.” </p>\n<p>The government warns that retrying Tsarnaev\'s sentencing could be longer than the previous 21-day proceeding and submit the victims to again relive the trauma of that day. </p>\n<p>At the time of the original trial, however, the parents of Martin Richard, an 8-year-old killed at the marathon, urged the government to take the death penalty off the table.</p>\n<p>“We understand all too well the heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed,” Bill and Denise Richard said in a <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/31/metro/bill-denise-richard-end-anguish-drop-death-penalty-2/\">letter published in the Boston Globe</a>. “We were there. We lived it. The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son, maimed our 7-year-old daughter, and stole part of our soul. We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives.” </p>\n<p>Neither the Department of Justice nor the attorney representing Tsarnaev responded to requests for comment ahead of Wednesday’s arguments. </p>\n<p>Martin Richard was the youngest of the marathon bombing victims. Lingzi Lu and Krystle Campbell died at the finish line, as well. The MIT officer who was killed was Sean Collier.</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-button-embed\"><a class=\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-button-error\" href=\"https://twitter.com/@KelseyReichmann\" data-size=\"large\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-twitter-extracted-i1635725700701647372=\"true\">Follow @@KelseyReichmann</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div id=\"email-subscribers\"> </div>\n<div>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/fate-of-boston-marathon-bomber-faces-supreme-court-reckoning/\">https://www.courthousenews.com/fate-of-boston-marathon-bomber-faces-supreme-court-reckoning/</a> </div>\n</div>\n</div>', '1', '114', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/AP21081492054371-1880x1364.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '3', '1', '', '', '1', '37', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', '*', '', ''),

It’s also wrong, and it leaves states like Texas and Missouri footing the bill,” Paxton said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Attempting to establish standing, Texas and Missouri claim ending border wall construction will lead to more immigrants illegally entering their states, increasing the amount of taxpayer funds they have to spend on educating undocumented children in public schools.</p>\n<p>In addition, the states claim, they will have to bear the costs of more paperless immigrants receiving state-funded health care, and incarcerating in state prisons those who are convicted of felonies.</p>\n<p>Texas says due to the fact it shares the largest border, 1,254 miles, with Mexico of the four states on the southwest border, a large number of immigrants who illegally enter the country remain in the state.</p>\n<p>“Likewise, empirical evidence shows that about 6 out of every 1,000 illegal aliens entering the United States enters and remains in Missouri,” the complaint states.</p>\n<p>Missouri’s and Texas’ lawsuit will likely be assigned to U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee. He is typically the only district judge who is assigned lawsuits filed in Victoria federal court.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-container\">\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>Tipton has already ruled in favor of Texas and against the Biden administration in two immigration-related cases this year.</p>\n<p>Less than a week after Biden took office, Tipton <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-blocks-100-day-deportation-ban-handing-early-loss-to-biden/\">blocked</a> him from carrying out a 100-day pause on deportations.</p>\n<p>In August, Tipton <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/federal-judge-blocks-biden-deportation-policies/\">issued</a> a nationwide injunction blocking Biden’s Department of Homeland Security from continuing to follow deportation guidelines he determined were forcing Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to avoid taking into custody undocumented immigrants convicted of serious drug crimes and crimes of moral turpitude, in violation of mandates imposed by Congress.</p>\n<p>Texas and Louisiana, its co-plaintiff in the deportation-guidelines case, have requested an en banc hearing before the Fifth Circuit, after a three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based appellate court <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/fifth-circuit-halts-order-for-biden-to-step-up-deportations/\">stayed</a> Tipton’s order.</p>\n<p>DHS plans to replace the interim deportation guidance with new rules Nov. 29.</p>\n<p>Though Biden has kept in place a pandemic-related Trump-era policy in which most immigrants who enter the country illegally are immediately expelled, Texas’ leaders blame his pledge to be more welcoming to refugees and asylum seekers than Trump for causing a crisis as Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 1.14 million immigrants at the southwest border in the first eight months of Biden’s presidency.</p>\n<p>Abbott launched Operation Lone Star in March, deploying thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and state troopers to South Texas to help Border Patrol agents arrest immigrants.</p>\n<p>This summer Abbott <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/texas-governor-says-state-will-build-border-wall-jail-trespassing-immigrants/\">announced</a> Texas will use $750 million of more than $2 billion the state Legislature allocated for border security over the next two years on building border walls on state land and on the property of private owners who agree to it.</p>\n<p>Abbott is also crowdsourcing funds for the project. The state had received <a href=\"https://www.borderwall.texas.gov/\">$54.3 million</a> in donations as of Oct. 8, though nearly 98% of it came from an anti-immigration billionaire who lives in Wyoming named Timothy Mellon, the Texas Tribune <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/06/timothy-mellon-texas-border-wall/\">reported.</a></p>\n<p>Abbott says his goal is to arrest immigrants who bypass Texas-built fences on trespassing charges to deter others from coming across the Rio Grande, the state’s border with Mexico.

Mexico wants cases to generally conclude within six months, timely and accurate access to case information and better access to legal counsel for asylum-seekers.</p>\n<p>Some of the administration’s most prominent pro-immigration allies say the time it took for Mayorkas to draft Friday’s opinion showed a lack of sense of urgency, which U.S. officials dispute.</p>\n<p>Many U.S.-based legal aid groups who have represented asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico say they will no longer take such cases, raising questions about how the U.S. can satisfy Mexico\'s insistence on better access to counsel. Administration officials say they believe there are enough other lawyers who will represent asylum-seekers sent back to Mexico.</p>\n<p>About 70,000 asylum-seekers have subject to the policy, which President Donald Trump introduced in January 2019 and his successor, Joe Biden, suspended on his first day in office. Mayorkas ended the policy <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/21_0601_termination_of_mpp_program.pdf\">in June</a> after an internal review, saying it achieved “mixed effectiveness.”</p>\n<p>Illegal border crossings <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters\">fell sharply </a>after Mexico, facing Trump’s threat of higher tariffs, acquiesced in 2019 to the policy’s rapid expansion. Asylum-seekers were victims of <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/campaign/remain-mexico\">major violence</a> while waiting in Mexico and faced a slew of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-news-donald-trump-immigration-government-and-politics-b6eb23ce42dde1dae496869d7b6d183b\">legal obstacles</a>, such as access to attorneys and case information.</p>\n<p>Mayorkas said Friday that his second review assumed the policy caused a significant drop in border crossings, calling it the strongest argument to keep it. Still, he said benefits do not outweigh costs in terms of relations with Mexico, resources and risks associated with exposure to violence while waiting in Mexican border cities.</p>\n<p>“(There) are inherent problems with the program that no amount of resources can sufficiently fix.” he wrote. \"Others cannot be addressed without detracting from key Administration priorities and more enduring solutions.”</p>\n<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the states of Texas and Missouri.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>GALVESTON, Texas (CN) — Texas sued President Joe Biden on Friday, seeking a declaration his mandate that all federal contractor employees get vaccinated against Covid-19 by Dec. 8 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/texas-sues-biden-administration-over-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-federal-contractor-employees.pdf\">lawsuit</a>, filed in Galveston federal court, also names as defendants the three co-chairs of the Safer Federal Workplace Task Force, which Biden established on his first day in office to provide guidance for the safety of federal employees during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>Implementing a decree Biden signed Sept. 9, the task force issued a <a href=\"https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Draft%20contractor%20guidance%20doc_20210922.pdf\">directive</a> setting a Dec. 8 deadline for “covered contractor employees” to be fully vaccinated and a stipulation that all federal contracts must include the clause starting Nov. 14.</p>\n<p>Texas claims the mandate is too broad because it applies to federal contractor employees who have already been infected with Covid-19, those who are working outdoors, working remotely at home full-time and even people whose job duties have nothing to do with the covered contract.</p>\n<p>“Defendants effectively claim for themselves a general police power to control American life, infringing on states’ sovereignty and usurping the powers reserved to the states under the Constitution,” the complaint states.</p>\n<p>The omission of natural immunity — antibodies triggered when people catch the virus — as an alternative to vaccination is a major oversight in the decree, Texas claims: “By all indications, natural immunity confers superior resistance to COVID-19 than any of the currently available vaccines, and one in three Americans had COVID by the end of 2020.”</p>\n<p>Texas also says that in imposing the mandate, Biden and the Safer Federal Workplace Task Force failed to explain why other best practices in fighting the spread of Covid-19 were not considered, such as requiring federal contractors to frequently test their staff for the virus in lieu of vaccines.</p>\n<p>Fed up with vaccine-resistant Americans amid a spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths caused by the highly infectious Delta variant, Biden announced a new plan Sept. 9 that, in addition to the rule for federal contractor employees, requires all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated, or tested every week, and requires vaccinations for all federal employees, hospital and nursing home workers — mandates that cover more than 80 million Americans.</p>\n<p>In response to Biden’s push, Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/texas-governor-bars-businesses-from-mandating-covid-vaccines-for-staff-and-customers/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/texas-governor-bars-businesses-from-mandating-covid-vaccines-for-staff-and-customers/\">issued </a>an executive order Oct. 11 barring all entities in Texas, including private businesses, from forcing anyone to get Covid-19 vaccines.</p>\n<p>Employment law experts say while Abbott’s order does not block private businesses from mandating their employees get vaccinated, it does provide broad protections as it gives workers the right to object to the shots “for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.”</p>\n<p>Texas claims Biden imposed the rules on federal contractor employees without first putting them through a required notice-and-comment period in which the public can weigh in.</p>\n<p>Texas says if it does not give in to Biden\'s coercion, it stands to lose more than $7.32 billion in future contracts with the federal government.</p>\n<p>“Additionally, the State of Texas faces an impending labor shortage as federal labor walkouts and strikes continue to occur as a result of the federal vaccine mandates — potentially leading to significant, concrete financial harm to the State in the form of unemployment benefits and increased Medicaid expenses,” the 34-page lawsuit states.  </p>\n<p>Texas cites a recent statement from Greg Hayes, CEO of Dallas-based defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, maker of Tomahawk missiles. Hayes <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/raytheon-will-lose-several-thousand-workers-due-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-ceo-2021-10-26/\">told</a> Reuters the company will lose several thousand employees who refuse to get the vaccine.</p>\n<p>The Lone Star State seeks a declaration Biden’s mandate is unconstitutional and unenforceable.</p>\n<p>“The federal government does not have the ability to strip individuals of their choice to get a vaccine or not,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said. “If the president thinks his patience is wearing thin, he is clearly underestimating the lack of patience from Texans whose rights he is infringing.” </p>\n<p>Paxton strategically filed the complaint in Galveston federal court.</p>\n<p>Only one federal judge presides in the Galveston federal courthouse, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Donald Trump appointee. So it is certain the case will be assigned to him.  </p>\n<p>The lawsuit also names as defendants Agricultural Department Secretary Tom Vilsack, Defense Department Secretary Lloyd Austin, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Acting Director of the Office of Budget and Management Shalanda Young and Administrator of the General Services Administration Robin Carnahan.</p>\n<p>More than 69,800 Texans have died from Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/45e18cba105c478697c76acbbf86a6bc\">according</a> to the Texas Department of State Health Services.</p>\n<p>“As of Oct. 27, 17.7 million people have received at least one dose, which is 60.8% of Texas’ population, and 15.4 million people, or 52.9%, are fully vaccinated,” the Texas Tribune <a href=\"https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2020/texas-coronavirus-cases-map/?_ga=2.4994547.1795065251.1635561131-439571334.1581712879&amp;_gac=1.148393413.1633553456.CjwKCAjwkvWKBhB4EiwA-GHjFrhsrbOxW_S9Gp1mmDRAKPL_ISmr0WP9jmNJ-XBGceFCsg5AY9C5mRoCU2sQAvD_BwE\">stated</a> in a report Friday.</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-button-embed\"><a class=\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-button-error\" href=\"https://twitter.com/@cam_langford\" data-size=\"large\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-twitter-extracted-i1635726154565384862=\"true\">Follow @@cam_langford</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div id=\"email-subscribers\">Source:  <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/texas-sues-biden-over-vaccine-mandate-for-federal-contractor-employees/\">https://www.courthousenews.com/texas-sues-biden-over-vaccine-mandate-for-federal-contractor-employees/</a> </div>\n</div>', '1', '114', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/biden-pelosi-budget-1880x1253.jpeg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '4', '4', '', '', '1', '41', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', '*', '', ''),

(Mary Altaffer/AP)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>NEW YORK (CN) — New York’s requirement for most healthcare workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19 beat a double-challenge to its constitutionality, with a Second Circuit ruling on an upstate and a downstate lawsuit heard in tandem. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Second-Circuit-vax-order.pdf\">ruling</a> vacated a previous <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/two-lawsuits-seeking-religious-exemptions-to-vaccine-mandates-saw-differing-outcomes/\">injunction</a> of the vaccine mandate, granted to a group of healthcare workers who filed suit in the Northern District of New York, saying they should be able to opt out of the vaccine on religious grounds. </p>\n<p>Three nurses who filed the other lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York lost their bid for an injunction in the lower court, but the Second Circuit later <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/religious-exemption-granted-for-now-to-unvaccinated-ny-nurses/\">ordered the state</a> to grant religious vaccine exemptions during the plaintiffs’ appeal. That order was also vacated in Friday’s ruling, which was published without an opinion. </p>\n<p>Those claiming religious objection point to the remote connection that the vaccines have to laboratory use of a fetal cell line harvested from aborted fetuses acquired in the 1970s and 1980s. </p>\n<p>As attorneys for the state noted in <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/consolidated-appeal-will-decide-fate-of-vaccine-mandate-for-ny-health-workers/\">oral arguments on Wednesday</a>, however, the same cell lines were used to develop dozens of <a href=\"https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/prove-it-hospital-asks-unvaccinated-employees-claiming-religious-exemption.html\">common medicines</a>, from Tums and Benadryl to Tylenol and Pepto-Bismol, which stoke little controversy.</p>\n<p>Cameron Atkinson, an <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EDNY-Patriots-hochul-brief.pdf\">attorney for the Long Island-based nurses</a> with the New Haven, Connecticut, firm Pattis &amp; Smith, assured the Second Circuit that he personally has chosen to stop consuming these medications now that he is aware of their origins. </p>\n<p>“Moral culpability depends on knowledge,” Atkinson told the three-judge panel.</p>\n<p>No major religion has declared the Covid-19 vaccine to be forbidden. Medical experts agree that widespread vaccination can cut down transmission, and in turn, the development of new variants of the coronavirus. </p>\n<p>U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Sack on Wednesday pushed back on the idea that holding religious beliefs may never get in the way of one’s life decisions. </p>\n<p>“If you\'re going to be a martyr, that means, ‘I can’t take this medicine, and therefore I can no longer be a nurse in a New York City hospital.’” </p>\n<p>Someone whose religion prohibits them from working on Saturdays, for example, couldn\'t get a job as a Jones Beach lifeguard, reasoned Sack, a Clinton appointee. </p>\n<p>While the state allows for medical exemptions, those are simply not comparable to what the plaintiffs are requesting, argued Deputy New York Solicitor General Steven Wu on behalf of the state. </p>\n<p>“This is a neutral, generally applicable law that is sustained under the free exercise clause,” he said, and anyone denied accommodations based on their religion could avail themselves of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. </p>\n<p>The attorney representing the upstate New York employees argued that hospitals were only offering telemedicine as an accommodation, which is not practical for all medical practices. </p>\n<p>“Surgeons cannot do surgery remotely,” said Christopher Ferrara of the Thomas Moore Society. “I don\'t see how a medical resident can complete a residency without being physically present in the hospital.” </p>\n<p>In an email to Courthouse News, Atkinson said he believes the country’s highest court will have the final say, and come out in favor of his three clients. </p>\n<p>“New York’s mandate forces an abominable choice on New York healthcare workers: abandon their faith or lose their careers,” Atkinson wrote. “Diane Bono, Michelle Melendez, and Michelle Synakowski have refused to buy one-way tickets to hell on the hysteria express. They have committed their futures to God’s hands, and we remain optimistic that the United States Supreme Court will strike down New York’s discriminatory mandate as violating the First Amendment.”</p>\n<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/high-court-refuses-to-block-maine-vaccine-mandate-for-health-workers/\">refused to block</a> a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for Maine healthcare workers, which went into effect on the same day.</p>\n<p>Justice Amy Coney Barret wrote the one-paragraph opinion, declining to hear the religious exemption lawsuit, focused on the use of the so-called shadow docket, which has come under recent scrutiny as a tool to fast-track politically charged cases. </p>\n<p>“In my view, this discretionary consideration counsels against a grant of extraordinary relief in this case, which is the first to address the questions presented,” she wrote. </p>\n<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch penned an eight-page dissent: “Laws that single out sincerely held religious beliefs or conduct based on them for sanction are ‘doubtless . . . unconstitutional.’” </p>\n<p>The New York appellate decision came as New York City employees face a new vaccine mandate, which will be enforced starting on Monday. After Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the mandate last week, more than 15,000 New York City municipal employees have gotten vaccinated, according to a data analysis by <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/facing-mandate-15000-nyc-municipal-workers-get-covid-vaccines-twice-many-holdouts-remain\">Gothamist</a>. </p>\n<p>However, twice as many government workers have yet to get the shot, which has raised concerns about staffing the city\'s police, fire and sanitation departments. </p>\n<div class=\"twitter-button-embed\"><a class=\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-button-error\" href=\"https://twitter.com/NinaPullano\" data-size=\"large\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-twitter-extracted-i1635726799572411552=\"true\">Follow @NinaPullano</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div id=\"email-subscribers\">Source:  <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/double-win-for-ny-health-worker-vaccine-mandate-in-federal-appeals-court/\">https://www.courthousenews.com/double-win-for-ny-health-worker-vaccine-mandate-in-federal-appeals-court/</a> </div>\n</div>', '1', '114', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/jj-covid-shot-1880x1254.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '3', '15', '', '', '1', '30', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

(Image via Courthouse News)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article-content\">\n<p>ALBANY, N.Y. (CN) — Confirming wide speculation that she would make a bid for the state’s top elected office, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced her run for governor Friday afternoon. </p>\n<p>James, a 63-year-old Brooklyn native, released a short video to accompany <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TishJames/status/1454138856987631622\">the announcement</a>. </p>\n<p>“I’ve spent my career guided by a simple principle: Stand up to the powerful on behalf of the vulnerable,” she said in the clip. “To be a force for change.”</p>\n<p>The announcement makes it official that James will square off against the Buffalo-bred Governor Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat; the two are expected to be top contenders. </p>\n<p>It was James’ <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/cuomo-harassment-probe/\">investigation</a> into sexual harassment allegations against then-Governor Cuomo, detailing them in a <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/cuomo-NYAG-Investigative-Report.pdf\">168-page report</a> that swiftly led to his resignation in August. </p>\n<p>One incident described in the report, accusations that Cuomo groped an executive assistant under her blouse at the Executive Mansion in December 2020, led Thursday to the filing of a <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/cuomo-charged-with-misdemeanor-sex-crime/\">misdemeanor criminal charge</a> against Cuomo in Albany City Court. </p>\n<p>Through his attorney, Rita Glavin, Cuomo denied the allegation. </p>\n<p>James quickly responded with a statement. </p>\n<p>“From the moment my office received the referral to investigate allegations that former Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women, we proceeded without fear or favor,\" she wrote. “The criminal charges brought today against Mr. Cuomo for forcible touching further validate the findings in our report.” </p>\n<p>In her campaign announcement video, James alluded to that work but without mentioning Cuomo by name. </p>\n<p>“I’ve held accountable those who mistreat and harass women in the workplace,” she said, “no matter how powerful the offenders.” </p>\n<p>In a separate Cuomo-centered <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/ny-nursing-home-virus-deaths-were-undercounted-ag-says/\">investigation</a>, James reported that the former governor’s administration underreported nursing home deaths from Covid-19 — twice as many residents had died than were included in state data. </p>\n<p>James’ track record also includes <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/ny-sues-to-dissolve-the-nra-accusing-top-execs-of-fraud/\">suing to dissolve</a> the National Rifle Association, brokering opioid claim settlements against pharmaceutical companies that won payouts as high as <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/jj-agrees-to-pay-230m-to-settle-new-york-opioid-claim/\">$230 million</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/amazon-loses-federal-fight-to-block-new-york-pandemic-safety-investigation/\">suing Amazon</a> over its worker-safety standards during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>\n<p>In the Amazon ongoing litigation, James’ office accused the e-commerce giant of failing to keep its employees safe at two New York distribution centers, where the essential workers continued reporting for duty during the earliest, most uncertain days of the pandemic. Amazon fired one employee, and issued a final written warning to another, in retaliation after the workers publicly protested their conditions, according to James’ <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/new-york-sues-amazon-over-worker-safety-during-pandemic/\">lawsuit</a>. </p>\n<p>New York hasn\'t elected a Republican governor since 2002 — a record James did not appear worried about in her 1 1/2-minute video when she touted her role in dozens of legal headaches for the party\'s figurehead, former President Donald Trump. </p>\n<p>“I’ve sued the Trump administration 76 times,” James said. “But who’s counting?” </p>\n<p>If her run is successful, James would be the country’s first Black female governor.</p>\n<p>“To say this is historic in nature is an understatement,” L. Joy Williams, a political consultant and head of the Brooklyn chapter of the NAACP, told <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/attorney-general-letitia-james-run-for-governor-2022\">Gothamist</a>. “She has the story and the history that would truly make this the people’s governor.” </p>\n<p>The city’s current public advocate, progressive Jumaane Williams, is an anticipated competitor, as is state Representative Tom Suozzi, a moderate Democrat from Long Island, as the party begins to gear up for its 2022 primary. </p>\n<p>James launched a new <a href=\"https://www.jamesforny.com/\">campaign website</a> on Friday.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

This encrypted tunnel carries data that cannot be deciphered without the proper keys, and you control what clients have access to those keys. A popular VPN software is called OpenVPN. This software uses strong encryption methods to help ensure that no spying eyes can see what you are doing. I cannot guarantee that this software will keep you completely anonymous, but it is an excellent start. VPNs have many other uses besides Internet anonymity; they can connect a user to a local area network even if they are not anywhere near it. If you need to access a file at a business from your home, a VPN is probably used. The objective of this guide is to explain how to configure OpenVPN on a server and client to form a strong encrypted VPN tunnel.<br /><br />This <a href=\"http://madisonlinux.org/InstallingOpenVPNOnUbuntu10.04?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=install_open_vpn_on_ubuntu.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">guide</a> helped me configure my connection.

In the terminal enter:<br /><br />sudo chown -R $USER /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/<br /><br /><strong>Vars file</strong><br /><br />We need to make some changes to the vars file in order to properly generate our certificates. In the terminal type:<br /><br />sudo nano /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars<br /><br />This command will open the vars file in the terminal, we need to edit a couple of fields. The first field we need to edit is the export KEY_CONFIG field. Look for that line in the file and replace it with:<br /><br />export KEY_CONFIG=/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl-0.9.6.cnf<br /><br />This is the configuration file used to create authorization certificates. <br /><br />Next, change the following fields at the bottom of your file to you liking. There are two e-mail lines, but you only need to edit the first one. Make sure you have quotation marks around each of the values.<br /><br />export KEY_COUNTRY<br />export KEY_PROVINCE<br />export KEY_CITY<br />export KEY_ORG<br />export KEY_EMAIL<br /><br />Once you are finished editing the values, press Control + O and then enter to save the changes, and Control + X to exit back into terminal.<br />We are now ready to generate certificates for the server.<br /><br />This next set of scripts is going to create the script for the server and one client. In terminal, use the cd command to move into the proper directory by entering:<br /><br />cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/<br /><br />Open the source script:<br /><br />source vars<br /><br />Clean the directory:<br /><br />./clean-all<br /><br />Build the encryption of the certificates and build the actual certificates:<br /><br />./build-dh<br />./pkitool --initca<br />./pkitool --server server<br /><br />Move into the new keys directory:<br /><br />cd keys<br /><br />Generate another key:<br /><br />openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key<br /><br />Copy all the keys into the /etc/openvpn/ directory:<br /><br />sudo cp server.crt server.key ca.crt dh1024.pem ta.key /etc/openvpn/<br /><br />The server keys and certificates are now created. Next, we need to make the client keys and certificates.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"step-toolbar\" data-location=\"stepBody\"><button class=\"step-tip\">Add Tip</button><button class=\"step-question\">Ask Question</button><button class=\"step-comment\">Comment</button><button class=\"svg-pdf step-download download-pdf\">Download</button></div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"step6\" class=\"step\" data-stepid=\"SALB8RVHIXHXVEP\">\n<h2 class=\"step-title\">Step 6: Create Client Certificates</h2>\n<div class=\"mediaset\">\n<div class=\"photoset-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"photoset\">\n<div class=\"photoset-row items-1 \">\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FK5/ZPOZ/HIXKDWFM/FK5ZPOZHIXKDWFM.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=79ed85cba01246149a70a9f0bc802b7d\" rel=\"photoset240\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FK5/ZPOZ/HIXKDWFM/FK5ZPOZHIXKDWFM.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=79ed85cba01246149a70a9f0bc802b7d\" data-fileid=\"FK5ZPOZHIXKDWFM\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FK5/ZPOZ/HIXKDWFM/FK5ZPOZHIXKDWFM.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=79ed85cba01246149a70a9f0bc802b7d\" alt=\"Create Client Certificates\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FK5/ZPOZ/HIXKDWFM/FK5ZPOZHIXKDWFM.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=79ed85cba01246149a70a9f0bc802b7d\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"step-body\">\n<p>The client certificates allow a client device access to the VPN server.

In my example, I assign the name ubuntu to my client device. Be sure to change both instances of the word client to your specific client name.<br /><br />Transfer the following files from the server to the client device. If Ubuntu does not let you copy the files. Try pressing Alt+f2 and entering gksudo +nautilus. Then you will be copying the files as root.<br /><br />/etc/openvpn/ca.crt<br />/etc/openvpn/ta.key<br />/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.crt<br />/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client.key<br /><br />Please note that the first two files have different directories than the last two. Transfer the files to the client device using some form of physical storage. Do not transfer the files over the Internet in a non-secure fashion such as e-mailing them to yourself. Later in this Instructable, I will show you where to place those files on the client device. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"step-toolbar\" data-location=\"stepBody\"><button class=\"step-tip\">Add Tip</button><button class=\"step-question\">Ask Question</button><button class=\"step-comment\">Comment</button><button class=\"svg-pdf step-download download-pdf\">Download</button></div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"step7\" class=\"step\" data-stepid=\"SLMJ38EHIXKDWFR\">\n<h2 class=\"step-title\">Step 7: Create Server VPN Scripts</h2>\n<div class=\"mediaset\">\n<div class=\"photoset-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"photoset\">\n<div class=\"photoset-row items-3 \">\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FVX/BFQN/HIXKDWGL/FVXBFQNHIXKDWGL.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=b4ff890792cfba0e84f3c2cd76b9683a\" rel=\"photoset243\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FVX/BFQN/HIXKDWGL/FVXBFQNHIXKDWGL.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=b4ff890792cfba0e84f3c2cd76b9683a\" data-fileid=\"FVXBFQNHIXKDWGL\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FVX/BFQN/HIXKDWGL/FVXBFQNHIXKDWGL.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=b4ff890792cfba0e84f3c2cd76b9683a\" alt=\"Create Server VPN Scripts\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FVX/BFQN/HIXKDWGL/FVXBFQNHIXKDWGL.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=b4ff890792cfba0e84f3c2cd76b9683a\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photoset-col\">\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FON/N4AK/HIXKDWGK/FONN4AKHIXKDWGK.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=3c640a67dd9b595f1902b02da4b1478a\" rel=\"photoset243\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FON/N4AK/HIXKDWGK/FONN4AKHIXKDWGK.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=3c640a67dd9b595f1902b02da4b1478a\" data-fileid=\"FONN4AKHIXKDWGK\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FON/N4AK/HIXKDWGK/FONN4AKHIXKDWGK.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;width=400&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=3c640a67dd9b595f1902b02da4b1478a\" alt=\"Create Server VPN Scripts\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FON/N4AK/HIXKDWGK/FONN4AKHIXKDWGK.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;width=400&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=3c640a67dd9b595f1902b02da4b1478a\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FKT/R36H/HIXKDWGJ/FKTR36HHIXKDWGJ.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=8c0de221fc16a80758c44cccf4ee9f5b\" rel=\"photoset243\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FKT/R36H/HIXKDWGJ/FKTR36HHIXKDWGJ.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=8c0de221fc16a80758c44cccf4ee9f5b\" data-fileid=\"FKTR36HHIXKDWGJ\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FKT/R36H/HIXKDWGJ/FKTR36HHIXKDWGJ.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;width=400&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=8c0de221fc16a80758c44cccf4ee9f5b\" alt=\"Create Server VPN Scripts\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FKT/R36H/HIXKDWGJ/FKTR36HHIXKDWGJ.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;width=400&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=8c0de221fc16a80758c44cccf4ee9f5b\" /></a>\n<div class=\"photoset-showmore\">2 More Images</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"step-body\">\n<p>The server needs some VPN Scripts bring up the VPN network, and to bring the VPN network back down.

We are going to configure the proper settings for the VPN server. There are many different things we have to change in this configuration file. In the file, a semicolon at the beginning of a line means that the line is commented out, meaning it does not apply. To uncomment a line, simply remove the semicolon and the line will become active. I will demonstrate this with as many pictures as I can. Please look at those pictures for the proper configurations if you do not understand the text. I am just going to tell you what to do in the text, so the pictures are extremely important.<br /><br />Copy the sample configuration files to our openVPN server directory. In a terminal enter:<br /><br />sudo cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/<br />sudo gzip -d /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz<br /><br />Then, open the Configuration file. In a terminal enter:<br /><br />sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf<br /><br />Make these changes in the file:<br /><br />Comment out the dev tun line.<br />Uncomment the dev tap line and add a 0 to the end. It should now say \'dev tap0\'<br /><br />Comment out server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0<br /><br />Uncomment the ;server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.50 10.8.0.100 line. <br />Change that line to something like: server-bridge 192.168.101.50 255.255.255.0 192.168.101.85<br />192.168.101.99<br />The first IP address is the local address of the server. The second set of numbers is the subnet mask, match it to your IP address. In most cases this value will not need to be changed, The third set of numbers is the beginning range IP address you would like to assign to devices that connect to your VPN. The fourth set of numbers is the ending range IP address you assign to client VPN devices. When a device connects to the VPN, it will be assigned a local IP address defined in the final two sets of numbers in this line. It is important that you do not assign IP addresses in this file that are already in use by other devices on the local network.<br /><br />Uncomment the ;push \"route 192.168.101.1 255.255.255.0\" line.<br />Change the IP address to match that of your default gateway. In my example it is: 192.168.2.1.<br /><br />Uncomment the ;push \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\" line.<br /><br />Uncomment the ;push \"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222\" and ;push \"dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220\" lines. If you would like to point the point the server to your own DNS servers, change the DNS server IP addresses. If not, you can leave this addresses alone as they are OpenVPN\'s DNS Servers.<br /><br />Uncomment the ;tls-auth ta.key 0 # This file is secret line.<br /><br />Uncomment the ;cipher AES-128-CBC line. <br /><br />Uncomment the ;user nobody and ;group nogroup lines<br /><br />Add these next three lines to the bottom of the file:<br /><br />up \"/etc/openvpn/up.sh br0\"<br />down \"/etc/openvpn/down.sh br0\"<br />push \"explicit-exit-notify 3\"<br /><br />Reboot your server to restart all networking equipment. <br />This completes the VPN server configuration, now we need to configure our client. <br /><br /><br /></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"step-toolbar\" data-location=\"stepBody\"><button class=\"step-tip\">Add Tip</button><button class=\"step-question\">Ask Question</button><button class=\"step-comment\">Comment</button><button class=\"svg-pdf step-download download-pdf\">Download</button></div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"step9\" class=\"step\" data-stepid=\"SQSEG00HIXKDWOW\">\n<h2 class=\"step-title\">Step 9: Install and Configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu Linux</h2>\n<div class=\"mediaset\">\n<div class=\"photoset-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"photoset\">\n<div class=\"photoset-row items-3 \">\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FCI/FJ24/HIXKDWS5/FCIFJ24HIXKDWS5.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=d032bf9f38af249a035b6c24a8b1192d\" rel=\"photoset264\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FCI/FJ24/HIXKDWS5/FCIFJ24HIXKDWS5.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=d032bf9f38af249a035b6c24a8b1192d\" data-fileid=\"FCIFJ24HIXKDWS5\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FCI/FJ24/HIXKDWS5/FCIFJ24HIXKDWS5.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;width=698&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=d032bf9f38af249a035b6c24a8b1192d\" alt=\"Install and Configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu Linux\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FCI/FJ24/HIXKDWS5/FCIFJ24HIXKDWS5.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;width=698&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=d032bf9f38af249a035b6c24a8b1192d\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photoset-col\">\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FU7/WSAB/HIXKDWS6/FU7WSABHIXKDWS6.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=f7f300f947b2982ea943fe267ec59786\" rel=\"photoset264\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FU7/WSAB/HIXKDWS6/FU7WSABHIXKDWS6.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=f7f300f947b2982ea943fe267ec59786\" data-fileid=\"FU7WSABHIXKDWS6\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FU7/WSAB/HIXKDWS6/FU7WSABHIXKDWS6.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;width=502&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=f7f300f947b2982ea943fe267ec59786\" alt=\"Install and Configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu Linux\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FU7/WSAB/HIXKDWS6/FU7WSABHIXKDWS6.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;width=502&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=f7f300f947b2982ea943fe267ec59786\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photoset-item photoset-cell\" data-imagenotes=\"[]\">\n<div class=\"photoset-image\"><a class=\"gallery-link\" href=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F6D/LHBS/HIXKDWS8/F6DLHBSHIXKDWS8.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=d120ff176ab6bc79cff69d4b2a1f95a9\" rel=\"photoset264\" data-download=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F6D/LHBS/HIXKDWS8/F6DLHBSHIXKDWS8.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;md=d120ff176ab6bc79cff69d4b2a1f95a9\" data-fileid=\"F6DLHBSHIXKDWS8\"><img class=\" lazyloaded\" src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F6D/LHBS/HIXKDWS8/F6DLHBSHIXKDWS8.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;width=502&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=d120ff176ab6bc79cff69d4b2a1f95a9\" alt=\"Install and Configure OpenVPN on Ubuntu Linux\" data-src=\"https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F6D/LHBS/HIXKDWS8/F6DLHBSHIXKDWS8.png?auto=webp&amp;frame=1&amp;crop=3:2&amp;width=502&amp;fit=bounds&amp;md=d120ff176ab6bc79cff69d4b2a1f95a9\" /></a>\n<div class=\"photoset-showmore\">5 More Images</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"step-body\">\n<p>This step will explain how to install and configure the OpenVPN client on Ubuntu Linux.

See the picture for clarification.<br /><br />In the SSL/TLS section. Enter the names of your keys and certificates. In my example I enter:<br /><br />ca.crt<br />client.crt<br />client.key<br />Please see my picture for further clarification on this step.<br /><br />Uncomment the tls-auth ta.key 1 line.<br /><br />Uncomment the cipher line and replace the x with AES-128-CBC. The line should now look like \'cipher AES-128-CBC\'<br /><br />Save the client file.<br /><br />There should be a OpenVPN GUI icon on your desktop. Open this program. If you are using Windows Vista/7/8 open this program as administrator. The program will load the configuration file. To connect to your VPN, find the icon in the system tray. Right click it and click connect. The program should now connect you to your VPN server. </p>\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/Host-Your-Own-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-with-O/\">https://www.instructables.com/Host-Your-Own-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-with-O/</a> </p>\n</div>\n</section>', '', '1', '117', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-10 11:26:18', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/private-vpn.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '3', '0', '', '', '1', '43', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', '*', '', ''),

You can connect via the Internet and securely access your shared files and resources. You don’t have to buy an expensive VPN server if don’t have a lot of users. Windows actually provides VPN server and client functionality.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we’ll set up the Windows 7 or Vista VPN server and connect with Windows XP, Vista, or 7. Now let’s get started!</p>\n<h2>Avoiding IP conflicts</h2>\n<p>Since VPN connections link networks together, you must be careful with the subnet and IP addressing so there aren’t any conflicts. On the network hosting the VPN server, you should use an uncommon default IP for the router, such as 192.168.50.1. If you have multiple offices, assign each to a different uncommon IP/subnet, such as 192.168.51.1, 192.168.52.1, and so on.</p>\n<div><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14\" src=\"https://www.practicallynetworked.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/win7-vpn-fig1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"309\" />Figure 1</div>\n<h2>Create an incoming VPN connection in Windows</h2>\n<p>To configure the Windows VPN server, you do what is described by Microsoft as “creating an incoming connection.” This will be the server or host of the VPN. Among other things, you’ll specify the users you want to be able to connect. Follow these steps to create an incoming connection:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right-click the network icon in the system tray and select <strong>Open Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Manage network connections</strong> (Windows Vista) or <strong>Change adapter settings </strong>(Windows 7).</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Alt</strong> key to show the File Menu and click <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>New Incoming connection… </strong>.</li>\n<li>Select who you’d like to give VPN access to and/or create custom accounts by clicking on <strong>Add someone</strong>. See <a href=\"http://practicallynetworked.com/img/win7-vpn-fig2.jpg\">Figure 2</a> for an example. When you’re done, click on <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Through the Internet</strong>, as <a href=\"http://practicallynetworked.com/img/win7-vpn-fig2.jpg\">Figure 3</a> shows, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Such as shown in <a href=\"http://practicallynetworked.com/img/win7-vpn-fig4.jpg\">Figure 4</a>, select the protocols you want to enable for this connection. You’ll likely want to select <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong>, so remote users receive an IP address and can access the Internet and/or network. Plus if you want the remote user(s) to access file and/or printer shares, select <strong>File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks</strong>. When you’re done, click <strong>Allow access</strong>.</li>\n<li>On the next window, click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you need to access the properties of the newly created incoming network connection and define the IP address range for VPN clients:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the <strong>Network Connections</strong> window, double-click <strong>Incoming Connections</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Networking</strong> tab and double-click <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Specify IP addresses</strong> and then enter a starting and ending address that’s within range of your local subnet but not conflicting with the DHCP range. For example, if your router’s IP is 192.168.50.1, you might enter 192.168.50.50 to 192.168.50.59 as shown in <a href=\"http://practicallynetworked.com/img/win7-vpn-fig5.jpg\">Figure 5</a>, which would support 10 clients. If you want clients to be able to assign themselves an IP, select that option.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on both dialog boxes to save the changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Configure any third-party firewalls</h2>\n<p>Windows will automatically allow the VPN connections through Windows Firewall when you configure the incoming connection on the host PC. However, if you have a third-party firewall installed on the host PC, you need to make sure the VPN traffic is allowed. You may have to manually enter the port numbers 47 and 1723.</p>\n<h2>Configure your IP address, dynamic DNS, and router</h2>\n<p>To enable VPN connections to the host PC from the Internet, you must configure your router to forward them to the Windows PC that’s accepting the incoming connections. You specify the host PC by entering its local IP address. Therefore, before you setup the port forward, you should ensure the IP address won’t change.</p>\n<p>Start by logging into to the Web-based control panel of the router. Then go to the Network or <a title=\"Webopedia Entry: DHCP\" href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DHCP.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DHCP</a> settings and see if you can reserve the IP address for the PC so it always gets the same one. This may be called DHCP reservation or Static DHCP. Some routers don’t have this feature. In this case, you’ll need to manually assign the PC a static IP in the TCP/IP settings of the network connection in Windows.</p>\n<p>Once you have figured out the IP address, find the virtual server or port forwarding settings in the router’s web-based control panel. Then create an entry forwarding port 1723 to the local IP address of the PC, such as Figure 6 shows. Don’t forget to save the changes!</p>\n<div><img src=\"http://practicallynetworked.com/img/win7-vpn-fig6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"261\" border=\"0\" /><br />Figure 6.</div>\n<p>If your Internet connection uses a dynamic IP address, rather than a static one, you should signup and configure a dynamic DNS service. This is because when you configure the remote clients, you have to input the Internet IP address of where the host PC is located. This will be a problem if the IP changes. However, you can sign up for a free service, such as from No-IP, and input your account details into the router so it will update the hostname with your IP. Then you’ll have a hostname (such as yourname.no-ip.org) to input into remote clients, which will always point to the current Internet IP address of your host PC.</p>\n<p>Now everything on the server side should be configured and ready to go. Next you need to setup the clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Create outgoing VPN connections in Windows</strong></p>\n<p>Now that you have the server setup, you need to configure the computers which you want to connect from, called the VPN clients. Here’s how to in Windows Vista and 7:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right-click the network icon in the system tray and select <strong>Open Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Set up a connection or network</strong> (Windows Vista) or <strong>Set up a new connection or network </strong>(Windows 7, as shown below).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-19\" src=\"https://www.practicallynetworked.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/win7-vpn-fig7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"464\" height=\"343\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the wizard, select <strong>Connect to a workplace</strong>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Use my internet connection (VPN)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Type the Internet IP address or hostname into the <strong>Internet address</strong> and enter something for the <strong>Destination name</strong>. See Figure 8 below for an example. You’ll probably want to keep the other options disabled.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18\" src=\"https://www.practicallynetworked.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/win7-vpn-fig8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"292\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click<strong> Next</strong> to continue.</li>\n<li>Enter a <strong>User name</strong> and <strong>password</strong> that was selected when you created the incoming VPN connection, and click Next to try to connect. It will attempt to connect using the following protocols: SSTP, PPTP, and then L2TP.</li>\n<li>Once connected, click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Windows may by default assign the connection as a Public Network, limiting sharing functionality. Therefore you probably want to change this. If you aren’t prompted to do so, open the <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> and click <strong>Customize</strong> (Windows Vista) or the <strong>Public network</strong> link under the connection name (Windows 7). Then on the popup window, select <strong>Work Network</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to create and outgoing VPN connection in Windows XP:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <strong>Network Connections</strong> window and click <strong>Create a new connection</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Connect to the network at my workplace</strong>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Virtual Private Network connection</strong>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the connection, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Do not dial the initial connection</strong>, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Type the Internet IP address or hostname, and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Limiting VPN traffic</h2>\n<p>By default, all the Internet traffic on the VPN client will pass through the VPN rather than the local Internet they are connected to. This is great if they are using a public connection, like a port in a hotel or Wi-Fi hotspot, since it keeps their browsing private.

I find that vegetables do well in them. Again, these come in many sizes, from a 2-gallon size up to a 100-gallon size for a quite large container garden. These pots are made of a sturdy, breathable fabric that feels somewhat like felt.</p>\n<p>This is beneficial because when planted in containers, plant roots grow toward the sides of the pot. In a hard-sided container, roots begin to circle when they reach the edge going around and around the perimeter and becoming root bound. With fabric pots, when the roots reach the outer edge, they dry out and die off.</p>\n<p>It may sound like a bad thing, but it’s not! When those roots die off, it causes the plant to send out lateral roots that are efficient at absorbing nutrients for a healthy, sturdy plant. The porosity of the fabric also allows the roots access to oxygen.</p>\n<p>These containers will last in the garden for years. I’ve had several large 50-gallon fabric pots for close to a decade now.</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h4>Glazed ceramic containers</h4>\n<p>These are made from clay and finished with a non-porous glaze. This glaze helps with moisture retention, meaning they don’t dry out quite as quickly as unfinished terra cotta pots.</p>\n<p>These containers are often used as a focal point in landscapes, filled with blooming flowers or a single small tree. There’s no reason, though, that you can’t fill yours with food! Planted with an assortment of pretty vegetables and flowers, glazed pots like these can absolutely hold their own as a beautiful addition to a patio or front yard garden.</p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14098 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" srcset=\"https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2.jpg 870w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2-550x367.jpg 550w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2-380x254.jpg 380w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/raised-bed-container-garden-2-260x173.jpg 260w\" alt=\"heads of lettuce in a galvanized vegetable garden container\" width=\"870\" height=\"580\" data-pin-description=\"Choosing the *right containers for your urban garden can make your limited space productive.

Without a drainage hole — or several — water can sit inside the bottom of a pot. <strong>This causes plant roots to rot.</strong> Most ready-made planters come with a drainage hole, but be sure to check. I’ve been surprised sometimes to pick up a glazed planter only to find that it didn’t have that all important drainage hole.</p>\n<p>If the vessel you use doesn’t have a drainage hole, which is often the case with upcycled containers, you’ll need to create one. For thin metal containers, use a large nail and a hammer to pound several holes in the bottom. For sturdy plastic containers or heavier duty metal, use a drill to create a drainage hole. If you use a smaller bit, make several holes; if you have a larger bit, like a 1/2” size, one or two holes should suffice.</p>\n<a href=\"https://learn.attainable-sustainable.net/the-5-gallon-garden\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22493 size-full lazyloaded\" src=\"https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-gallon-garden-logo.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-gallon-garden-logo.png 300w, https://www.attainable-sustainable.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-gallon-garden-logo-150x100.png 150w\" alt=\"5-gallon garden logo\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-pin-description=\"Choosing the *right containers for your urban garden can make your limited space productive.

Some estimates have the number of homeschoolers at over 2 million with many more flocking to this option in response to recent COVID 19 mandates.</p>', '<p>Growth in home-based learning has been highly diverse, with the number of families across all ethnic groups, regardless of income or education, on the rise. However, homeschooling is still subject to many myths and misperceptions.  Below are some of the top myths surrounding homeschooling today</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"4c0d3e74ca98\">Myth: Homeschooling Is Only For Religious or Faith-Based Families</h3>\n<p>Fact: The National Household Education Survey (NHES), lists the highest rated reason parents choose to homeschool as the negative environment of their child’s public school. The desire for religious education is not the primary reason. In fact, many families prefer a secular homeschool curriculum and prefer to integrate their values into lessons when appropriate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"ad53e0a891f8\">Myth: Homeschoolers Don’t Socialize</h3>\n<p>Fact: Homeschoolers socialize more than public schooled children. The nature of personalized learning and homeschool curriculum is to explore the world more. Homeschoolers routinely visit museums, parks, science centers and participate in a variety of social activities. There is a wide array of social experiences for homeschoolers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"cd690515a0cf\">Myth: Homeschoolers Are All Gifted Or Naturally Intelligent</h3>\n<p>Fact: The idea that homeschoolers are gifted or naturally intelligent is a common myth. However, many parents seek out homeschooling because their kids need more one-on-one attention. Homeschooling is often a great solution for kids who are advanced learners, as well as kids who feel disengaged in school, bored, or are struggling.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"e259b12a785f\">Myth: Homeschoolers Do Not Go To College</h3>\n<p>Fact: Homeschoolers are more likely to attend college than traditionally schooled students, and are more likely to stay and graduate. Other data suggests that homeschooled students routinely perform better on standardized tests including the SAT and ACT. Colleges are looking less at standardized tests and GPAs and instead are looking at a student’s resume. In this area, homeschoolers have a distinct advantage, because they have more experiences to share with colleges and universities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"1156fcee9328\">Myth: Homeschooling Is Not An Accepted Form Of Education</h3>\n<p>Fact: Homeschooling has been around for over one hundred years and in many ways predates our current public education system. The number of children homeschooling is estimated to be between 2.0 and 2.5 million. Due to declining school budgets, poor academic ratings, crime, bullying, and reduced resources, parents are looking for better options that will benefit their children.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"b3f1d25fc94c\">Myth: I have heard that Homeschooling is not only a health and safety risk for children but also a threat to society and that homeschooled kids could grow up to become <a href=\"https://hslda.org/post/introducing-new-series-hslda-s-response-to-harvard-professor-bartholet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">enemies of the state</a>.</h3>\n<p>Fact:  Homeschooling poses reduced health and safety risks and children who are homeschooled grow up to participate more in community service, are more likely to vote, succeed in college and internalize the values of their parents than are public schooled children. <sup>1</sup></p>\n<p class=\"cite\">1“Research Facts on Homeschooling ….” <a href=\"https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"06672748cef6\"><strong>Myth: Parents Are Not Qualified To Teach</strong></h3>\n<p>Fact: Every parent has anxiety about their child’s education and whether or not they can be a good enough teacher. We often don’t think about it, but the knowledge we pass on to our children throughout their life is substantial. We teach our children an infinite number of things, including manners, empathy, how to walk, how to get dressed, how to reason, and how to learn. This goes far beyond learning how to read, write, understand numbers, or appreciate art and culture.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"2f3c700f72f2\"><strong>Myth: Homeschooled Kids Cannot Play Sports Or Participate In Extracurricular Activities</strong></h3>\n<p>Fact: Many parents don’t realize that public schools often allow homeschoolers to play in school sports or participate in after-school activities. Homeschooled kids play in recreational leagues, participate in martial arts, and any number of other extracurricular activities and community service projects. Because homeschooling provides families with greater flexibility, homeschoolers are free to pursue their passions and talents.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"ed80e87f1732\">Myth: Homeschooling Parents Are Stay-At-Home Moms Who Don’t Work</h3>\n<p>Fact: Through a combination of hard work, cooperation, and support from other homeschooling families, parents who rely on two incomes often find ways to homeschool. It is important to remember, homeschooling is personalized and flexible, so by its nature – you can mold it to fit your family’s needs.</p>\n</div>\n</div>', '1', '115', '2021-09-03 22:36:47', '82', '', '2021-11-10 10:10:59', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-09-03 22:36:47', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":1,\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/wadi-lissa-unsplash.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '8', '0', '', '', '1', '35', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', '*', '', ''),
