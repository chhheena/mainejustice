Scientists were discovering that many pharmaceutical drugs could be made from oil.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRockefeller immediately seized on the opportunity to monopolize the oil, chemical and medical industries all at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe best thing about petrochemicals was that everything could be patented and sold for high profits.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut there was one problem with Rockefeller’s tyrannical plan for the medical industry: natural &amp; herbal medicines were very popular in America at that time.

Based on this report, more than half of all medical colleges were shut down. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHomeopathy and natural medicines were demonized by the media and government; and doctors who dared to practice holistic medicine were jailed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo coerce any remaining doctors and scientists who were sitting on the fence, Rockefeller gave over $100 million dollars to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic front group called “General Education Board”. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWithin a short space of time, medical colleges were all homogenized.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny.

Is the mask-wearing, sock-loving, all-singing, all-dancing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau actually the son of Fidel Castro?\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau is famously known as the son of Canada’s former liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, comparison images of Pierre, Justin and Fidel Castro suggest there might be more the story.\n\nAccording to Joe Rogan, the resemblance shared by Castro and Trudeau is “completely wild” and the Canadian prime minister should do a 23andMe genetic test ASAP. Rogan is not wrong. The resemblance is uncanny. But the Trudeau-Castro rabbit-hole goes much deeper than he realizes.\n\nStrong physical resemblance aside, the Cuban rumors are also bolstered by historical facts.\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau’s birthplace of Ottawa is a long way from Havana, his mother Margaret Trudeau visited Cuba nine months before Justin was born, and there are photographs of her socializing with Fidel Castro.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6.

Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.\n\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?\n\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.\n\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.\n\nWhile researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons.

Based on this report, more than half of all medical colleges were shut down. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHomeopathy and natural medicines were demonized by the media and government; and doctors who dared to practice holistic medicine were jailed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo coerce any remaining doctors and scientists who were sitting on the fence, Rockefeller gave over $100 million dollars to colleges, hospitals and founded a philanthropic front group called “General Education Board”. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWithin a short space of time, medical colleges were all homogenized.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4.

Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6.

Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.\n\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?\n\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.\n\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.\n\nWhile researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons. Such a self-spreading weapon may prove uncontrollable and irreversible.\n\nWe don’t have to dig very deep for a historical example of weaponized biology.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4.

Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6.

Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca.

European countries, including Sweden and Switzerland, sterilized members of the Roma minority in the early half of the 20th century and some, like Slovakia, continued even beyond that.

Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring.\n\nIs this how the elites consider the human species? A pest population that needs to be culled?\n\nResearchers have been working on experimental “self-spreading vaccines” that could stop a virus leaping from animals to humans — a phenomenon scientists call zoonotic spillover.\n\nA virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic.The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population. In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.\n\nWhile researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons.

The two investment firms also hold large stakes in vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastercard provides funding for the World Bank’s <a href=\"https://id4d.worldbank.org/\">Identity for Development</a> (ID4D) Program, which “focuses on promoting digital identification systems to improve development outcomes while maintaining trust and privacy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the New York School of Law recently <a href=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/06/nyu-law-school-raises-alarm-on-large-scale-human-rights-violations-of-global-digital-identity-programs.html\">described</a> the ID4D program, which touts its alignment with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , as one which could pave the way to a “<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/digital-road-digital-id-systems-human-rights-violations/\">digital road to hell</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the center, this would occur through the prioritization of “economic identity” and the use of an infrastructure that has “been linked to severe and large-scale human rights violations” in several countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastercard is also active in Africa through its <a href=\"https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/14429/\">joint initiative</a> with another fintech (financial technology) company, Paycode, to “increase access to financial services and government assistance for remote communities across Africa” via a biometric identity system containing the data of 30 million individuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>World Bank, WHO promote ‘pandemic preparedness’ and vaccine passports</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Bank in late June <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220701-world-bank-creates-fund-to-better-prevent-respond-to-pandemics\">announced</a> the creation of a fund that will “finance investments in strengthening the fight against pandemics” and “support prevention, preparedness and response … with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fund was <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220701-world-bank-creates-fund-to-better-prevent-respond-to-pandemics\">developed</a> under the lead of the U.S., Italy and current G20 president Indonesia, “with broad support from the G20,” and will be active later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will provide more than $1 billion in funding for areas such as “disease surveillance” and “support against the current as well as future pandemics.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WHO is also a “stakeholder” in the project and will provide “technical expertise,” according to WHO’s director-general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement follows a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/press/2019/06/world-economic-forum-and-un-sign-strategic-partnership-framework/\">strategic partnership</a> between the UN and the World Economic Forum, to “accelerate” the implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://weforum.box.com/s/rdlgipawkjxi2vdaidw8npbtyach2qbt\">agreement</a> has recently <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/caelorumangelus/status/1549123326244798466\">circulated</a> on social media, it was announced in June 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It encompasses six areas of focus, including “health” and “digital cooperation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of health, the agreement purports that it will “support countries [sic] achieve good health and well-being for all, within the context of the 2030 Agenda, focusing on key emerging global health threats that require stronger multistakeholder partnership and action.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, the “digital cooperation” promoted by the agreement will purportedly “meet the needs of the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/focus/fourth-industrial-revolution\">Fourth Industrial Revolution</a> while seeking to advance global analysis, dialogue and standards for digital governance and digital inclusiveness.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n                         <div class=\"abh_box abh_box_down abh_box_business\">\n <a href=\"#abh_about\">About</a> <a href=\"#abh_posts\">Latest Posts</a>\n\n<div class=\"abh_tab_content\">\n<div class=\"abh_image\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\" class=\"url\" title=\"Niamh Harris\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=80&#038;r=x\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=160&#038;r=x 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo\" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"abh_social\"> </div>\n<div class=\"abh_text\">\n<h3 class=\"fn name\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\" class=\"url\">Niamh Harris</a></h3>\n<div class=\"abh_job\">\n<span class=\"title\">Writer</span> at <span class=\"org\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com\" target=\"_blank\">News Punch</a></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"description note abh_description\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"abh_image\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\" class=\"url\" title=\"Niamh Harris\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=80&#038;r=x\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=160&#038;r=x 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo\" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"abh_social\"> </div>\n<div class=\"abh_text\">\n<h4>Latest posts by Niamh Harris <span class=\"abh_allposts\">(<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\">see all</a>)</span>\n</h4>\n<div class=\"abh_description note\">									<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/zelensky-wants-more-funds-arms-munitions-advanced-fighter-jets-to-fight-russia/\">Zelensky Wants More Funds, Arms, Munitions &#038; Advanced Fighter Jets To Fight Russia</a><span> - August 12, 2022</span>													<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/mps-grill-dutch-govt-on-eus-great-reset-agenda/\">MPs Grill Dutch Govt On WEF&#8217;s Great Reset Agenda</a><span> - August 12, 2022</span>													<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/disney-casts-drag-queen-in-their-new-marvel-series/\">Disney Casts Drag Queen in Their New Marvel Series</a><span> - August 12, 2022</span>				\n</div>\n</div> \n</div> </div>\n\n	</div>\nThe World Bank Has Created $1 Billion Fund For Vaccine Passports\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n<strong>As the World Health Organization (WHO) and global governments move forward with plans for an updated or new pandemic treaty, other organizations are moving forward with vaccine passport technologies and partnerships.</strong><br /><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/the-world-bank-has-created-1-billion-fund-for-vaccine-passports/\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '111', '2022-08-11 09:29:34', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:06:15', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-12 17:32:13', '2032-08-09 17:32:13', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '291', '', '', '1', '1', '{}', '0', '*', '', '');

His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLl9RSVdlaFZsNzRz</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bombshell Evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau Is Fidel Castro’s Son</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 10, 2022 9:34 am</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlZ1Y1pZcXdMVGpj\" data-date=\"1660000250\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-video-title=\"The Global Elites Are Normalizing Pedophilia\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VucZYqwLTjc/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/VucZYqwLTjc\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"VucZYqwLTjc\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VucZYqwLTjc\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Governments across the world, operating under the control of the World Economic Forum, are waging war on our children.

Very,” before walking off camera.\n\nHis bizarre video was quickly topped a few seconds later when Geller posted an even more outrageous letter to Putin, threatening to use “every last molecule of my mind power to prevent you from launching a nuclear attack”.\n\nGeller then asked readers to take ‘”five seconds out of your day to visualise a radiant, energetic force field…like a dazzling, golden shield in the sky” that he claimed would deflect any nuclear warheads deployed by the Kremlin, turning them back to destroy Russia.\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmRDTnlIbTJ6WTlN</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Uri Geller Threatens To Nuke Russia Using Just His Psychic Powers</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 5, 2022 10:25 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ\" data-date=\"1659648584\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-video-title=\"UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7URELIJsblY/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/7URELIJsblY\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"7URELIJsblY\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7URELIJsblY\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The United Nations has declared war on conspiracy theories, describing the rise of conspiracy thinking as “worrying and dangerous”, and providing the public with a toolkit to “prebunk” and “debunk” anybody who dares to suggest that world governments are anything but completely honest, upstanding and transparent.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN also warns that George Soros, the Rothschilds and the State of Israel must not be linked to any “alleged conspiracies.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO has teamed up with Twitter, the European Commission and the World Jewish Congress to launch the campaign dubbed #ThinkBeforeSharing: Stop the spread of conspiracy theories.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe UN wants you to know that events are NOT “secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent” and if you encounter anybody who thinks the global elite are conspiring to consolidate power and dictate global events, you must take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to UNESCO, “if you are certain you have encountered a conspiracy theory” on the internet then you must post a relevant link to a “fact-checking website” in the comments.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Never mind the fact that “fact checkers” are mostly untrained and unqualified hacks performing “fact checks” from their bedroom in between posting far-left political content and getting high.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nUNESCO also provide advice for anyone who encounters a real live conspiracy theorist in the flesh.

Tesla’s UFO — antigravity technology&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know that Tesla was all about free energy and alternative powers sources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nActually, it wasn’t unidentified.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite this, the methods and design of Tesla’s revolutionary vehicle is believed to match the description of people who witnessed disk-shaped flying objects, or UFO’s.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is believed that Tesla’s UFO had ‘eyes’ made of electro-optical lenses, arranged in quadrants, allowing the pilot to see everything. Screens and monitors are placed on a console where the browser can observe all areas around the vehicle, and Tesla’s incredible invention included magnifying lenses, which could have been used without changing positions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Tesla’s Death Ray&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPrior to the release of the declassified documents by the FBI, many people argue that Tesla’s Death Ray was just another conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPreviously, it was believed that Tesla’s Death Ray did not exist, and the FBI claimed for over a decade that none of their agents had EVER investigated Tesla’s papers, nor was the bureau in possession of any of them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was recommended that Tesla constantly remained under surveillance in order to protect him from ‘foreign enemies’ who may also have an interest in “the secret of such an invaluable instrument of war and/or defense.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3. Free Energy, and wireless electricity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the help of funding from JP Morgan, Tesla successfully built and tested the famous Wardenclyffe Tower.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe structure was a massive wireless energy transmission station which, according to Tesla, had the ability to transmit wireless power across great distances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla saw the Wardenclyffe Tower as the beginning of a massive free energy project.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTesla wanted to use the tower not only to transmit free energy but to send out messages, telephone calls across the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, and as we have learned through history, the idea of Free Energy isn’t really welcomed by big corporations. After all, why give free energy to the masses when you can make the masses pay big time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEventually, Tesla’s funding was canceled, and the tower was destroyed, along with Tesla’s ideas of a world powered by free energy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4. Tesla’s Oscillator&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n6. Drones in 1898&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\">\n                <img src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/plugins/youtube-feed-pro/img/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Tesla’s Oscillator\n\nThis device was an electromechanical apparatus patented by Tesla in 1893.\n\nThe device was popularly known as Tesla’s Earthquake machine after the European inventor claimed that one version of his device caused an Earthquake in New York in 1898.\n\nIn other words, the device could allegedly simulate earthquakes, which meant it could be weaponized. Some conspiracy theorists are convinced that Tesla’s technology was later further developed and is being used by HAARP.\n\n5. Tesla’s Futuristic Aircraft\n\nIn addition to creating devices that could potentially be used as weapons, and structures that could offer Free Energy to the world, Nikola Tesla also worked on electrically powered airships that, according to reports, could transport passengers from New York to London in three hours.\n\nThese aircraft were not ordinary vehicles. They were supposedly able to harness energy right fro Earth’s atmosphere and had no need ever to stop and refuel.\n\n6. Drones in 1898\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, Tesla invented DRONES.\n\nIt was called Tesla’s TELEAUTOMATON. And the funny part is that the government had this technology in their possession for over a hundred years. \n\n7. Propulsion systems for Spacecraft, and Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity\n\nWhile we discussed something similar in Tesla’s UFO, the truth is that he went beyond flying objects.\n\nIn an unpublished article of Man’s Greatest Achievement, Tesla outlined his Dynamic Theory of Gravity saying that ‘luminiferous ether fills all space’. Tesla said that the ether is acted upon by the life-giving creative force. The ether is thrown into “infinitesimal whirls” at near the speed of light, becoming ponderable matter. Then, the force subsides and motion ceases, matter reverts to the ether (a form of “atomic decay”).\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 3, 2022 8:31 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLmhRdUQwVnBXVVhv\" data-date=\"1659485369\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-video-title=\"Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hQuD0VpWUXo/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/hQuD0VpWUXo\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQuD0VpWUXo\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course.

These strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.\n\nRecently, DARPA has gotten involved in the research.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkVad0F5STNScE1n</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">Bill Gates Developing Vaccine That Spreads ‘Like a Virus’ To Vaccinate People Without Consent</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 1, 2022 9:14 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLkgxVWxJeTdpc2Fj\" data-date=\"1659139846\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-video-title=\"The Globalist Elite Want Us To Start Eating Each Other\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/H1UlIy7isac/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/H1UlIy7isac\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"H1UlIy7isac\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1UlIy7isac\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"The elite have been using celebrities to normalize the idea of eating bugs and insects.

almost all their output is advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The proposed amendments don’t alter that.

In his view, he said, “the WHO is not qualified to make global health decisions.”</p>\n\n                         <div class=\"abh_box abh_box_down abh_box_business\">\n <a href=\"#abh_about\">About</a> <a href=\"#abh_posts\">Latest Posts</a>\n\n<div class=\"abh_tab_content\">\n<div class=\"abh_image\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\" class=\"url\" title=\"Niamh Harris\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=80&#038;r=x\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=160&#038;r=x 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo\" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"abh_social\"> </div>\n<div class=\"abh_text\">\n<h3 class=\"fn name\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\" class=\"url\">Niamh Harris</a></h3>\n<div class=\"abh_job\">\n<span class=\"title\">Writer</span> at <span class=\"org\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com\" target=\"_blank\">News Punch</a></span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"description note abh_description\"></div>\n</div> <div class=\"abh_image\"><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\" class=\"url\" title=\"Niamh Harris\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=80&#038;r=x\" srcset=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0deff02639d5da9145d14f204f751aa?s=160&#038;r=x 2x\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo\" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" loading=\"lazy\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"abh_social\"> </div>\n<div class=\"abh_text\">\n<h4>Latest posts by Niamh Harris <span class=\"abh_allposts\">(<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/phytoforce/\">see all</a>)</span>\n</h4>\n<div class=\"abh_description note\">									<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/zelensky-wants-more-funds-arms-munitions-advanced-fighter-jets-to-fight-russia/\">Zelensky Wants More Funds, Arms, Munitions &#038; Advanced Fighter Jets To Fight Russia</a><span> - August 12, 2022</span>													<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/mps-grill-dutch-govt-on-eus-great-reset-agenda/\">MPs Grill Dutch Govt On WEF&#8217;s Great Reset Agenda</a><span> - August 12, 2022</span>													<a href=\"https://newspunch.com/disney-casts-drag-queen-in-their-new-marvel-series/\">Disney Casts Drag Queen in Their New Marvel Series</a><span> - August 12, 2022</span>				\n</div>\n</div> \n</div> </div>\n\n	</div>\nWHO Renews Its Push for Global Pandemic Treaty\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n<strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is pushing forward with plans to enact a new or revised international pandemic preparedness treaty.</strong><br /><a href=\"https://newspunch.com/who-renews-its-push-for-global-pandemic-treaty/\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-11 08:46:35', '82', '', '2022-08-12 17:32:13', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-12 17:32:13', '2032-08-09 17:32:13', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '290', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Each entity within the Borg has no individual thoughts or will. They are in a group consciousness where all are constantly supervised, guided and controlled.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Life imitating art&#8221; describes something occurring in real life the same or similar to something depicted in a piece of art or fiction. An example of this can be seen in the World Economic Forum (WEF), an organization that is a major mover and shaker in world affairs today. In June 2020, at its 50th annual meeting, the WEF announced the launch of the Great Reset, an initiative to reimagine the world and transform the global economy. Part of this effort involves transhumanism – the developing of technologies that cross physical, digital and biological worlds to improve human mental and physical capabilities.</p>\n<p>One of the slogans of this effort is <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/to-build-back-better-we-must-reinvent-capitalism-heres-how/\">&#8220;Build Back Better,&#8221;</a> a saying echoed by many political and business leaders around the world over the past few years. &#8220;Build Back Better&#8221; envisions a world where everyone is tied to a digital identification that links to a central-bank programmable digital currency, electronic health records, travel and a social credit score like the kind used in Communist China today. In short, every facet of life would be controlled by those who manage this system.</p>\n<p>But in order to &#8220;Build Back Better,&#8221; the current world system must be dismantled, demolished and destroyed. Disruptions and chaos are either designed or exploited by these global elites to bring about their concept of a utopian society.</p>\n<p>Many of us remember the 1999 science fiction action film called &#8220;The Matrix.&#8221; It depicts a future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which an artificial intelligence (AI) created to distract humans while exploiting the bioelectric power of their bodies as an energy source.</p>\n<p>Another example of life imitating art is the Metaverse, a virtual world accessible through a special immersive headset that completely isolates a person from his immediate surroundings. This artificial world would allow people to escape the challenges of life to supposedly live the kind of fuller lives only the very wealthy experience in the real world. Those in this system would be so distracted in time that they may not realize their pacification, exploitation and loss of freedom (Revelation 3:17).</p>\n<p>In an episode of television show &#8220;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&#8221; Capt. Picard is abducted by the Borg and assimilated into the Collective. He is saved from their system and restored to humanity after he is rescued by the U.S.S. Enterprise crew and the Borg nanoparticles controlling him are removed from his body.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;The Matrix,&#8221; protagonist Thomas Anderson was saved from the illusory world of the AI system and restored to humanity by Morpheus and his team when they unplugged him from the pod that imprisoned, controlled and exploited him as an energy source.</p>\n<p>Many of those belonging to international efforts such as those promoted by the WEF and its allies are reminiscent of the kings of the earth in Psalm 2 who conspire against the Lord Jesus Christ. They seek to usurp His righteous rule by creating an artificial, dark reality where they think they can be the lords of life and death over a humanity they reimagine and recreate in their own image.</p>\n<p>Capt. Picard and Thomas Anderson illustrate the idea of something too strong and too evil from which to escape by themselves. They needed outside help to save them from a terrible fate. Likewise, the &#8220;collective&#8221; or &#8220;matrix&#8221; being constructed by the global elites of today is too powerful and evil to escape on our own. We need Someone from the outside far more powerful and willing to save us – and that Someone is Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>Just as God overthrew and humiliated the gods of Egypt and delivered Israel from their captivity when they could not deliver themselves (Exodus 12:12), He will deliver us from the god of this world and his servants who seek to build an all-powerful false reality to enslave and destroy humanity.</p>\n<p>Through His death on the cross, Jesus disarmed the rulers and authorities, making a public display of them, having triumphed over them (Colossians 2:9-15). He saved sinners who trust in Him from their captivity by canceling their unpayable sin debt on the cross.</p>\n<p>Because Jesus rose again from the dead, He is the only one who can deliver His people from the clutches of those seeking to create the Great Reset. In scoffing laughter, Jesus will bring their plans to nothing and shatter their efforts with a rod of iron (Psalm 2:4-12; Revelation 11:16-18, 19:11-21).</p>\n<p>As we live in the reality of Christ, we still live in a world corrupted by sin and run by wicked people who seek to distract and assimilate us into their &#8220;reality.&#8221; It can often produce a stress on our lives that makes us very weary. But the apostle Paul encourages us not to despair, but to live in hope (Romans 8:18-19).</p>\n<p>Along with the aches and pains, the degradation of strength and the corruption our bodies experience over time in this world, all of nature undergoes a similar decay. There is nothing in the utopian transhumanist dream of the Fourth Industrial Revolution that can change this. It is a poor counterfeit that cannot deliver what it promises because of the sinful nature of man that ends only in death.</p>\n<p>The true and only remedy is the salvation secured through the bodily resurrection of Jesus. We look forward not to an artificial, imperfect body made by fallen man that cannot last, but to an eternal, perfect body created by God and granted as a gift to all who trust in Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:1-4).</p>\n<p>Though we groan within our earthly bodies, we have the guarantee of eternal life in Jesus as a present reality, even though we still see this through the eyes of faith.</p>\n<p>At the heart of the gospel message is Jesus conquering death by rising from the grave. Because of this truth, those who believe in Him will experience a permanent upgrade (1 Corinthians 15:51-53).</p>\n<p>The new world order of suffering and death came through Adam&#8217;s sin, but it was overcome by the Greatest Reset of Jesus dying on the cross for sinners and paying their debt in full (Romans 5).</p>\n<p>The Great Reset has been thoroughly defeated by the Greatest Reset of Jesus rising from the dead. Because He is risen, the redemption of our bodies from mortality to immortality is certain, and along with creation we will experience the culmination of our longing to be with Jesus, our Redeemer, forever.</p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Wade. Congratulations. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we won&#8217;t work every day to make the life you&#8217;re living as miserable as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m no fan of Mitt Romney. His recent tweet, however, is worth repeating: &#8220;The American people, who are drowning in debt and inflation, need a life preserver, and Democrats just gave them a bag of hammers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even before Schumer, Manchin and the Democrats tied this latest bag of hammers to our belts, too many Americans were barely keeping their noses above water. On Aug: 1, the New York Post reported, &#8220;The &#8216;misery index&#8217; of inflation and unemployment reached 12.7% in June. … That reading would rival the level that followed the Great Recession of 2008.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Right. So, after the misery index reached another all-time high (like golf a lower score is better), Democrats think what the American people need is <i>more</i> inflationary spending, 87,000 new border security agents – just kidding – IRS agents and soul crushing audits, and corporate tax increases passed directly to consumers drowning in debt. </p>\n<p>That&#8217;s in addition to more onerous energy regulations, fewer pipelines and drilling leases to ease the intentional pain at the pumps, more unabated crime, less ability to defend ourselves and more illegal immigration to carry on taxpayers&#8217; backs.</p>\n<p>Maybe invading the Florida sanctuary of our embattled former president Gestapo-style will help calm our frayed nerves and unite the dispirited country. It&#8217;s certainly worth a try! </p>\n<p>If none of those well thought through policies eases the misery index, perhaps more of our hard-earned, highly audited tax dollars sent abroad to another &#8220;moral imperative&#8221; foreign war will help … or more of our increasingly precious Strategic Petroleum Reserves steaming away to China &#8230; maybe more of our tallest and strongest sons in dresses competing against our daughters and roaming girls&#8217; locker rooms will finally make us grateful for our wise and caring ruling class. And it you don&#8217;t like it, no more federally funded lunch programs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Work with us, comrades – we&#8217;re trying here! How many bags of hammers does it take to make you miserable ingrates happy and compliant?&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the thickening socialist fog of the Potomac, I&#8217;m beginning to think Democratic legislators simply can no longer see life in America for what it really is. That, or they lack all compassion for their surviving fellow fetuses who must necessarily live in the world they&#8217;re creating for us, but not for them.</p>\n<p>So long as they manage to pull off their next election by hook or by crook, the ruling class is remarkably insulated from the misery index they work so diligently to exacerbate – to say nothing of the nakedly two-tiered justice system that will shield them for life, regardless of even the most dubious behavior, in or out of office. </p>\n<p>Unlike yours, life in 2022 inside the Beltway is mighty sweet for D.C. royalty and their privileged family members. </p>\n<p>Ever since the &#8220;deadly insurrection&#8221; where the biggest threat to our democracy, Ashli Babbitt, was shot dead, our rulers&#8217; armed security is the best in the world. And their retirement funds and stock portfolios are healthier than ever. Of course, it&#8217;s not just insider-trading information that&#8217;s the envy of Wall Street; the salary isn&#8217;t bad either. And thanks to you it comes with a generous travel budget, office budget and expense account – despite AOC complaining about it not being nearly enough.</p>\n<p>Designer Met Gala dresses aren&#8217;t cheap, ingrate.</p>\n<p>Granted, her pay bests what she was earning mixing drinks, although with a record misery index, that&#8217;s questionable – NYC bars are understandably doing a brisk business. Just don&#8217;t take the subway home with that tip money in your pocket now that George Soros has emptied out the jails.</p>\n<p>Like in the Christmas classic &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life,&#8221; we find ourselves suddenly living in a nightmarish Potter&#8217;s World, conjured up by the soul-sucking, mean old curmudgeon, Mr. Potter, who bears a creepy resemblance to Chuck Schumer. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry to say George Bailey won&#8217;t be able to save us. What will save us is a mass awakening. Call it the &#8220;More Woke Than You Are&#8221; movement, where we thank our police officers, go to church, put up flags, plant flowers, clean up and beautify the streets of our towns – even if such threatening, patriotic behavior places us on a &#8220;domestic terrorist&#8221; list. </p>\n<p>It has become abundantly clear by now that the great &#8220;uniter&#8221; and most popular president in U.S. history by vote count, Dark Brandon, comes with baggage from being a notorious drinker in Delaware – which pills can&#8217;t solve, even for the remainder of his term as president of Potter&#8217;s World.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the third in line for president, similarly challenged Nancy Pelosi, flew halfway around the world to stomp on China&#8217;s red line like a petulant child while likely enabling a few lucrative chip deals for her nearly invisible yet privileged son. (I left out the second in line, since even her own party would never allow her to hold the nuclear football.) </p>\n<p>Whoever is running the left&#8217;s utopian Potter&#8217;s World, it&#8217;s become a miserable and nasty place to live that can only get worse. But like George Bailey, we&#8217;ve graciously been given a second chance at life with an abundantly clear choice: Subject our suffering families and communities to more &#8220;reap the whirlwind&#8221; Chuck Schumer – sorry – I meant to say, evil old Mr. Potter; or stay out of the treacherous and icy river altogether and go back to our crashed car, determined with all our might to live and thrive again for the sake of our children. </p>\n<p>The solution is up to us. Love our God, love our families, proudly fly our American flags, &#8220;shoot for the moon&#8221; in life, vote, and restore sanity via the ballot box so overwhelmingly that even the most vigorous election <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/05/will-timid-gop-elephants-endure-summer-love/\">chicanery</a> is not enough to overcome the landslide of decency in our &#8220;One Nation Under God.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Did I say &#8220;VOTE&#8221;?!</p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Countless LGBT activists, including many public-school teachers, have taken to proselytizing the new transgender salvation to America’s children, both on social media and within the schools themselves. Even Biden’s far-left Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fully supports taxpayer-funded amputations of healthy body parts of these vulnerable children, declaring ghoulishly, “We should help those have the life-affirming care that they need.” The result? Untold numbers of America’s kids are being led into lives of not just unending conflict, confusion, suffering, deformity and disability, but far too often – as multiple studies prove – suicide. The whole unbelievable story – including the underlying reasons, almost entirely unreported elsewhere, for what amounts to the most massive child sexual abuse campaign in American history – is explored as never before in the July issue of WND’s critically acclaimed Whistleblower magazine, titled “<a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/\">WHAT’S REALLY BEHIND THE TRANSGENDER CRAZE?</a>”</i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

One day we prayed. The next day we didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>I was in the third grade, just an innocent kid, in Warren Point School in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. I was 9 years old. It was something I looked forward to. The class always participated in it. It didn&#8217;t require that we were all from the same faith – Catholics, Protestants, Jews and kids with no faith. Teachers, too.  In my class, I had my favorite teacher – Miss Sally Abraham. She was Jewish. That didn&#8217;t matter to any Christian. We all got along.</p>\n<p>She might read a scripture and pray. We kids would get very quiet and participate. It took no more than a few minutes. That&#8217;s how we started the school day.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court took a case from atheist Madalyn Murray O&#8217;Hair who couldn&#8217;t stand that the Lord&#8217;s Prayer was recited by American kids each day. I had the privilege of praying with her son, William Murray, as an adult.</p>\n<p>The court found that the prayer violated the First Amendment: &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Needless to say, it didn&#8217;t in any way establish religion. It did, however, prohibit the free exercise thereof. (Of course, I recall when the absolute abridging of speech and the press took place in America. That occurred more recently when speech codes were enforced by Big Tech! What&#8217;s next for the Constitution?)</p>\n<p>I was thinking of these abominations when I came across this in Psalm 78.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.  We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t it tragic that the commandments of God are no longer followed?</p>\n<p>Churches are taking the commandments down, which were once posted outside! At one time they were posted in public building and on billboards. (I used to post them on billboards by the hundreds when I had the money! That stopped cold when Google demonetized WND and we had to beg readers to support our work because this guardian of &#8220;truth&#8221; – Google, I mean – no longer paid us.)</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s hope today due to the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. How about a new look at the a ruling from a long time ago when people forgot about God as described in the Bible? Why not look again at prescribed prayer instead of proscribed prayer?</p>\n<p>And since the freedom of the press and freedom of speech are required by the Constitution of the United States, why not bring them back?</p>\n<p>Maybe if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, we will. Would that be so bad?</p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Is it <i>really</i> believable to think that <i>all</i> these different facets of society would go careening off the rails at the same time? Or is their devolution instead the result of intelligent, diabolical design?</p>\n<p>Consider for a moment the top <i>known</i> echelons of control over various societal pillars – Big Pharma, the military, politics, Big Tech, etc.</p>\n\nOnly two fund management companies – BlackRock and Vanguard – represent tens of trillions of dollars of ownership positions in every Fortune 500 company;\n\n\nEffectively, all major industries – from pharma and retail to food production, tech and entertainment – have been dramatically concentrated with controlling power centered within a handful of companies each;\n\n\nHalf a dozen media conglomerates control over 90% of all U.S. legacy media outlets;\n\n\nThe top five banks hold majority banking, credit card servicing, lending and other money service market share, and therefore control over these top industry players; and\n\n\nThe FAANG giants of Big Tech – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google – <i>each</i> hold market-dominating, controlling market shares – <i>in multiple markets.</i> (And yes, they want to suck you dry.)\n\n<p>So, what might appear as disparate sources of chaos are in actuality only a couple of degrees of separation away from one another as a result of ever-concentrating market share, power and interlocking authority.</p>\n<p>The results themselves point to intelligent design. If it were sheer incompetence, or uncoordinated change, then <i>some</i> substantial minority of societal changes would randomly benefit our nation or mitigate the march to madness. But they don&#8217;t. They all point <i>forward</i> to the cliff beyond which lies ruin – which means they all simultaneously point <i>backward</i> toward a malevolent hand (or small set of hands) that is, by its every action, utterly opposed to humanity itself.</p>\n<p><b>Design connotes intent</b></p>\n<p>When you look at a device – say, a bicycle – after a few moments&#8217; consideration, you probably determine, <i>Oh, this is for riding on, so you can go faster and farther.</i> (Some might err and suppose it a large cheese shredder, but work with me here.)</p>\n<p>When you look at <i>this</i> societal &#8220;device&#8221; – a gigantic, churning, morphing behemoth – by looking at its results, and examining its countless, metastasizing tentacles, it doesn&#8217;t take long to determine the intent of the controlling, malevolent hand and its Quisling minions.</p>\n<p><i>They are enemies – to our liberties, to our nation, to our families, to our future.</i></p>\n<p>They are enemies to humanity … and they want us <i>all</i> dead.</p>\n<p><b>Tyranny of the impotent</b></p>\n<p>And yet we remain. How could that be?</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8221; might want total destruction – but wanting isn&#8217;t getting. And yes, they might hold a seemingly insurmountable hand of cards, but appearances are not reality.</p>\n<p>The 135th Psalm describes idols – today&#8217;s money, and sexual perversions, and drugs, and reprobate lifestyles – as having mouths, but not speaking; as having eyes, but not seeing; as having ears, but not hearing; as having no breath (or life) in them at all. The psalmist then declares, &#8220;They who craft [the idols] are as the idols are, as are they who trust in them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For all the power, planning, money, position and scheming our adversaries possess, they are as impotent as the worthless idols they worship. They may make a mess, but when push comes to shove they&#8217;re as smoke on the wind – <i>and their day of reckoning is coming.</i></p>\n<p><b>A Time to Stand</b></p>\n<p>In the book &#8220;A Time to Stand,&#8221; Walter Lord details the origins, character and untimely end of the Texicans who fought against Santa Ana at The Alamo.</p>\n<p>Detractors might claim the heroes of The Alamo were routed. Yet their heroic sacrifice, magnified by Col. William Barret Travis&#8217; epic letter seeking reinforcements, sparked the fire that led to Texas&#8217; independence.</p>\n<p>In answering the call to defend liberty, they fell – but their heroism echoes through the ages.</p>\n<p>Clearly, all who love liberty are being called to awaken from our slumber; to engage in resisting the encroaching long, dark night our enemies desire.</p>\n<p>I recently completed a book entitled, &#8220;Nehemiah Strong.&#8221; (Visit <a href=\"https://johndyslin.com\">johndyslin.com</a> for more information, and use &#8220;WND1&#8221; for a 10% discount.) It&#8217;s a 480-page field manual equipping patriots and believers to stand, occupy and overcome in this hour of trial. As I wrote these last two years, I strove to balance equipping readers with practical advice with exhorting them to be strong in the fight – and in the Power of His might (Ephesians 6:10).</p>\n<p>How severely this fight will test us remains to be seen. Regardless, remember the prophetic call of the prophet Daniel from 26 centuries ago. In describing the saints of this late hour, Daniel marveled, &#8220;but they that do know their God shall <i>be strong and do exploits</i>&#8221; [my emphasis] – <i>chazaq asah</i> in the Hebrew.</p>\n<p>Are you awake? Will you stand? Will you &#8220;be strong and do exploits&#8221;?</p>\n<p>To all who stir at the challenge of the encroaching darkness, I exhort you:</p>\n<p>Wake up. Stand. <b>Be strong and do exploits.</b></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5029344\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dyslin220812.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"699\" height=\"190\"></p>\n<p><i>John Dyslin is the author of <a href=\"https://johndyslin.com\">&#8220;Nehemiah Strong: Life-Sustaining Essentials for a Season of Trial.&#8221;</a></i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, in light of the Biden administration&#8217;s effort to frame domestic violent extremism as America’s &#8220;greatest threat,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/08/10/exclusive-whistleblower-names-another-fbi-official-who-allegedly-pressured-agents-to-pad-domestic-extremism-stats/\">reported Breitbart News</a>.</p>\n<p>Jill Sanborn, who worked at the FBI for more than two decades, was the recipient of a letter from Jordan, the committee&#8217;s ranking member, and Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., that came after the whistleblower also accused Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault of seeking to inflate domestic violent extremism case numbers.</p>\n<p>When President Biden declared in a speech during his first week in office that he was <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2021/01/biden-orders-assessment-domestic-violent-extremism-threat/\">ordering an assessment of the &#8220;domestic violent extremism&#8221; threat</a>, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he understood Biden to be referencing the entire opposition to Democrats on the right: &#8220;If you read his speech and listen to it carefully, much of it is thinly veiled innuendo, calling us white supremacists, calling us racists, calling us every name in the book.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jordan, in a July 27 letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray, said FBI officials &#8220;are pressuring agents to reclassify cases as &#8216;domestic violent extremism&#8217; even if the cases do not meet the criteria for such a classification.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/07/whistleblowers-fbi-closed-hunter-biden-probe-leaked-russian-disinformation-claim/\">Thibault was named in whistleblower allegations reported to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa</a>, charging he quashed investigative activity related to Hunter Biden&#8217;s laptop.</p>\n<p>Since then, according to Grassley, Wray informed the senator that Thibault will no longer be making decisions about which investigations the FBI should pursue.</p>\n<p>The letter from Jordan and Johnson requests that Sanborn appear before the committee to testify about the allegations. Sanborn is not legally required to appear.</p>\n<p>In testimony to Congress last year before leaving the FBI, she said &#8220;domestic violent extremists will continue to pose an elevated threat of violence to the United States.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>See a clip of Sanborn&#8217;s testimony:</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">FBI&#8217;s counterterrorism Chief Jill Sanborn: &#8220;2019 was the most fatal year for domestic violent extremist attacks since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Full video here: <a href=\"https://t.co/GMokeaSgbk\">https://t.co/GMokeaSgbk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AGpLVeKoVw\">pic.twitter.com/AGpLVeKoVw</a></p>\n<p>— CSPAN (@cspan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1387784362251403266\">April 29, 2021</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Allegations that the FBI&#8217;s decision-making is politically motivated have taken center stage in the aftermath of the bureau&#8217;s raid Monday of former President Trumps Mar-a-Lago estate.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

We see it in schools, we see it in clinics, we see it at the world’s largest pediatric gender clinic, GIDS at Tavistock, which saw a 5,337% rise in adolescent girls in the last decade.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said it used to be that young boys and middle-aged men were the only societal components seeking &#8220;gender-affirming&#8221; care.</p>\n<p>The study claimed to review information from 2017 and 2019, the report said, &#8220;during which the proportion of transgender people who were female at birth reportedly increased slightly but remained under 50% — and argued that this invalidated concerns that identifying as transgender is a social contagion that’s primarily impacting adolescent girls.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, the report explained that researchers &#8220;assumed&#8221; the sex reported by transgender respondents was their biological sex at birth, without any evidence for that.</p>\n<p>University of Oxford Sociologist Michael Biggs explained to the Daily Caller the possibility that researchers incorrectly assumed transgender respondents meant &#8220;sex at birth&#8221; when they responded to the question and that would be an explanation of why the findings were the &#8220;opposite&#8221; of what other related studies have found.</p>\n<p>The report explained, &#8220;The proportion of youth who were transgender decreased from 2.4% in 2017 to 1.6% in 2019, and the rate of born-male to born-female transgender youths went from 1.5:1 to 1.2:1.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The lead author on the study, Turban, in fact told the Daily Caller News Foundation, &#8220;Overall, the percentage of adolescents who were openly transgender wasn’t dramatically different in 2017 and 2019.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report explained media outlets &#8220;parroted&#8221; the conclusions without criticism even though there were &#8220;methodological issues with the study.&#8221;</p>\n<p>NBC, in fact, concluded the study said &#8220;social contagion isn’t causing the increases in youths identifying as transgender, as did articles in U.S. News and The Hill.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One other author, Alex Keuroghlian, claimed there&#8217;s just a lack of evidence that &#8220;transgender and gender diverse youth assigned female at birth identify as transgender due to social contagion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, Candice Jackson, former assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights, pointed out, &#8220;There is no explanation given for how, unlike with homosexuality, we’re seeing entire friend groups and entire segments of classrooms adopting trans identities together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing this study highlights is that, because we have already gone down the road of accepting in the legal realm, the scientific realm and the medical realm, the notion that sex is so offensive to some people that you might not even ask about it or expect a factual answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5023127\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/wb-072022-COVER-181.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"232\"></p>\n<p><b>EDITOR’S NOTE:</b> <i>During the Biden era of rapidly metastasizing madness, the greatest madness of all may be today’s shockingly widespread campaign to indoctrinate, seduce, groom and flat-out RECRUIT America’s children into the dark world of transgenderism.

They say they are not militarizing the Internal Revenue Service. But a recent job posting by the Biden-Harris regime should cause massive concern to those of us who know the IRS is coming after law-abiding middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The job posting for &#8216;IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent&#8217; represents exactly what we’ve feared from this increasingly tyrannical federal government. As Andy Ngo reported: &#8216;The American IRS has a job posting for prospective special agents where you will need to carry a gun &amp; be willing to kill.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report noted that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said, &#8220;87,000 IRS agents will be hired with $80 billion taxpayer dollars when the Senate Reconciliation bill passes this weekend. And they’re buying more guns &amp; ammo too.

Countless LGBT activists, including many public-school teachers, have taken to proselytizing the new transgender salvation to America’s children, both on social media and within the schools themselves. Even Biden’s far-left Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fully supports taxpayer-funded amputations of healthy body parts of these vulnerable children, declaring ghoulishly, “We should help those have the life-affirming care that they need.” The result? Untold numbers of America’s kids are being led into lives of not just unending conflict, confusion, suffering, deformity and disability, but far too often – as multiple studies prove – suicide. The whole unbelievable story – including the underlying reasons, almost entirely unreported elsewhere, for what amounts to the most massive child sexual abuse campaign in American history – is explored as never before in the July issue of WND’s critically acclaimed Whistleblower magazine, titled “<a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/\">WHAT’S REALLY BEHIND THE TRANSGENDER CRAZE?</a>”</i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.
