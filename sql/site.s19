Is there any reason we couldn’t accommodate them for 21 minutes?”</p>\n<p>“Senator,” replied Wray, “I had a flight that I’m supposed to be high-tailing it to outta here, and I had understood that we were going to be done at 1:30, so that’s how we ended up where we are.”</p>\n\n<p>Grassley then pointed out that he has a private jet at his disposal, allowing him to leave whenever he wants. “If it’s your business trip, you’ve got your own plane.

In June, he went to Saranac lake and back to Washington D.C. a few days later on the Gulfstream.</p>\n<p>The use of the FBI’s Gulfstream jet for private trips is controversial since it was originally intended for counterterrorism use. James Comey, Wray’s predecessor, also used the jet for private travel.</p>\n<p>The director is required to reimburse the cost of a single class airline ticket for his personal trip, while it costs several thousand dollars an hour to just operate the Gulfstream. So, instead of just flying on a public plane, Wray is choosing to exploit the resources he has as the FBI Director.</p>\n<p>Wray is not the first director to draw criticism for the use of this jet, either. Back in 2013, when Comey was the FBI director, Grassley vocalized his issues with this highly-expensive form of travel, saying,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“These luxury jets were supposedly needed for counterterrorism, but it turns out that they were used almost two-thirds of the time for jet-setting executive travel… Nobody disputes that the Attorney General and the FBI Director should have access to the secure communications, but, for instance, there’s no reason they can’t take a less expensive mode of transportation, or cut their personal travel.”</p></blockquote>\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.24.43-PM-740x493.png\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"1052\" height=\"701\" srcset=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.24.43-PM-740x493.png 740w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.24.43-PM.png 979w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px\" /></p>\n<p>Following this display of disrespect in the hearing, top-ranking House Republicans wrote a letter on Monday stating that they will be investigating Wray for potential ethical and financial misconduct over his alleged taxpayer-funded travel.</p>\n<p>The letter reads,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We write to conduct oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) use of Government aircraft and compliance with the applicable Federal regulations and requirements. We have questions about whether you are properly reimbursing federal taxpayers for your personal travel aboard government aircraft.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>It continues,</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Although certain federal officials are permitted to use government aircraft for personal or political use, these expenses must be reimbursed. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), past FBI directors have used government aircraft for personal use as is permissible. These former officials reimbursed federal taxpayers at the commercial rate, which can be thousands of dollars less than the actual cost of operating the government aircraft. Reimbursement payments for personal travel are made to the FBI Finance Division, which in turn deposits the funds to the Department of the Treasury.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fox News noted that government plane travel is authorized for “official purposes” and may only be used for informal travel when no commercial air is available or would cost more, per Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance.</p>\n<p>The House Republicans have requested Wray’s travel records and cost accounting to taxpayers by August 29.</p>\n<div>\n\n</div>', 'https://100percentfedup.com/fbi-director-cuts-congressional-hearing-short-to-fly-to-vacation-home-in-taxpayer-funded-jet-republican-lawmakers-investigate-for-ethical-and-financial-misconduct/', '100PercentFedUp.com', '2022-08-16 19:32:45', 'YTowOnt9', '3b2ab9eeaffaacc0379941d8da6fdc629767a4fe', '0', '0', '0'),

Among these is Alzheimer’s disease.</p>\n<p>The study further demonstrates in cell culture studies that glyphosate exposure appears to increase the production of soluble beta amyloid (Aβ) and reduce the viability of neurons. The accumulation of soluble beta amyloid, the sticky protein responsible for the formation of soluble beta amyloid plaques, is one of the central diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>\n<p>Further evidence suggestive of potential hazards to neurological health were observed when the researchers examined changes in gene expression via RNA sequencing in the brains of mice following glyphosate exposure.</p>\n<p>These RNA transcripts hinted at disruptions in the expression of genes related to neurodegenerative disease, including dysregulation of a class of brain cells responsible for producing the myelin sheath critical for proper neuronal communication.

Despite vast investments in research and drug development, the affliction remains without effective treatment. A suite of therapies, developed over many decades at extravagant cost, have one by one failed to alleviate the symptoms of the disease.</p>\n<p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. The progression of the disease usually begins with mild memory loss. As the disease develops, increasing confusion and a breakdown in communication abilities often result, as the affliction attacks brain pathways involved in memory, language and thought.</p>\n<p>Some 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, as of 2020, according to the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Unlike heart disease or cancer, the death toll for Alzheimer’s disease is on a frightening upward trajectory. By 2040, costs of the disease are projected to rise dramatically to between $379 billion and more than $500 billion annually. The staggering toll of the illness is currently projected to nearly triple to 14 million people by 2050.</p>\n<p>The onset of symptoms typically occurs after age 60, and the risk to individuals doubles every five years after age 65. Although genetics are believed to play a role in some cases of Alzheimer’s disease and a family history of the disorder is considered a significant risk factor, environmental factors are believed to play a significant role in the disease.</p>\n<p>Researchers are trying to learn how genetic correlates may subtly interact with environmental and other factors to decrease or enhance the likelihood of developing the affliction. Some recent research suggests that lifestyle changes, including proper physical activity, nutritious food, limited alcohol consumption and not smoking may help prevent or slow cognitive decline, noting that brain and cardiovascular health are closely linked.</p>\n<h2><strong>Toxic effects: The jury is out</strong></h2>\n<p>The new study examines the neurological effects of glyphosate, the most ubiquitous herbicide in global use. Each year, around 250 million pounds of glyphosate are applied to agricultural crops in the U.S. alone. Although the chemical is regarded as generally safe to humans by the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Food Safety Authority, researchers are taking a second look.</p>\n<p>Studies of acute herbicide use suggest they are not harmful, but little is known about possible long-term effects from prolonged exposure. One issue of considerable concern is that glyphosate can cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of endothelial cells preventing dissolved substances in the circulating bloodstream from readily passing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system, where the brain’s neurons reside.</p>\n<p>Potential risks to brain health posed by glyphosate should be critically evaluated, particularly for those consistently exposed to the herbicide.</p>\n<p>“The Alzheimer’s connection is that there’s a much higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in agricultural communities that are using this chemical,” Winstone said. “We’re trying to establish a more molecular-science based link between the two.”</p>\n<p>The study exposed mice to high doses of glyphosate, then detected elevated levels of TNF-α in their brains. The researchers then exposed extracted mouse neurons in petri dishes to the same levels of glyphosate detected in the brains of mice, observing elevated amyloid beta and cell death in cortical neurons. Dysregulated oligodendrocyte RNA transcripts, which could indicate disruption of myelination, were detected in brain tissue.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the results demonstrate a correlation between glyphosate exposure and classic symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, though the authors stress that much more work will be required before a causative link can be established.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the widespread use of the chemical and the disturbing correlates highlighted in the current study underscore the need for intensified investigation. Among the pressing questions to be answered: How does prolonged, low-dose exposure to glyphosate affect the brain; does glyphosate act synergistically with other chemicals present in common herbicides; and can glyphosate be detected post-mortem in patients who died of Alzheimer’s disease?</p>\n<p>On the horizon, new drugs designed to reduce TNF-α in the brain are being explored, offering renewed hope for those with Alzheimer’s disease as well as other neurodegenerative ailments.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

A showdown may come “in the coming weeks,” if sanity does not prevail.</em></p>\n<p><em>White House and Pentagon spokesmen keep insisting, </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3120707/usd-policy-dr-kahl-press-conference/\"><em>as <strong>Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl</strong> did on Aug.</em> 14</a>:</p>\n<p>“What’s important for us right now is to make sure that Beijing understands that our forces in the region will continue to operate, to fly, to sail wherever international waters allows. That includes the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>“I think you should expect that we will continue to do Taiwan Strait transits, as we have in the past, in the coming weeks. …”</p>\n<h2><b>What About President Biden?</b></h2>\n<p>Not to worry. To the degree it matters, he seems relaxed. On Aug. 8, after China announced new post-Pelosi-visit military drills in the seas and airspace around Taiwan, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-08-08/biden-says-he-is-concerned-about-chinas-moves-around-taiwan\">Biden expressed mild concern</a> about China’s deployments, but spoke reassuringly to reporters:</p>\n<p>“I’m concerned they (the Chinese) are moving as much as they are,” but I don’t think they’re going to do anything more than they are.”</p>\n<h2><b>Is Biden Listening to His Own PR People, and …</b></h2>\n<p>Here is White House Strategic Communications Director <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/08/01/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-security-council-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-2/\"><strong>John Kirby</strong> at a briefing on August 1</a>:</p>\n<p><b>“… Nothing has changed – nothing has changed</b> – about our One China policy … Put simply, there is no reason for Beijing to turn a potential visit [by Pelosi] … into some sort of crisis or conflict, or use it as a pretext to increase aggressive military activity in or around the Taiwan Strait. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p>“And yet, over the weekend, even before Speaker Pelosi arrived in the region, China conducted a live-fire exercise. China appears to be positioning itself to potentially take further steps in the coming days and perhaps over longer time horizons.</p>\n<p>“Now, these potential steps … could also include actions in the diplomatic and economic space, such as further <b>spurious legal claims like Beijing’s public assertions last month that the Taiwan Strait is not an international waterway</b><b>. </b>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p>“Some of these actions would continue concerning trendlines … but some could be of a different scope and scale.”</p>\n<h2><b>… and is Kirby Listening to the Bobbsey Twins?</b></h2>\n<p>Kirby’s boss, whiz-kid national security adviser <strong>Jake Sullivan</strong> and his elder (but equally innocent twin) <strong>Antony Blinken </strong>have served Biden poorly. In the fine schools they attended, they seem to have concentrated on courses on US Exceptionalism, skipping over what <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-john-mearsheimer-blames-the-us-for-the-crisis-in-ukraine\">John Mearsheimer calls</a> “Balance of Power Politics 101.”</p>\n<p>On the key question of Sino-Russian relations, they seem to have been operating out of textbooks a half-century old when they told President Biden that China was “squeezing” Russia – the exact opposite of what has been happening for several decades now. Worse still, they seem to have learned close to nothing about what the Soviets used to call the “world correlation of forces.”</p>\n<p>In a word, these extremely bright whiz kids have helped drive the Chinese and the Russians into each other’s arms. <b>That’s what has changed</b> – plus China’s recent military buildup that makes it a formidable foe.</p>\n<h2><b>Not Hard to See This Coming</b></h2>\n<p>On May 25, 2021, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://original.antiwar.com/mcgovern/2021/05/25/is-the-biden-putin-summit-doomed\">when the date of June 16 was announced</a> for the in-person summit between Presidents Biden and Putin, it seemed necessary to warn Biden and his neophyte advisers that a major shift in the “world correlation of forces” was bound to heavily influence the June talks. China, of course, would not be taking part in the bilateral talks, but it would be very much present.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://original.antiwar.com/mcgovern/2021/12/05/biden-putin-talk-tuesday-with-xi-in-the-wings/\">We worried</a>:</p>\n<p>“Whether or not Official Washington fully appreciates the gradual – but profound – change in America’s triangular relationship with Russia and China over recent decades, what is clear is that the US has made itself into the big loser. The triangle may still be equilateral, but it is now, in effect, two sides against one. …</p>\n<p>“There is little sign that today’s US policymakers have enough experience and intelligence to recognize this new reality and understand the important implications for US freedom of action. Still less are they likely to appreciate how this new nexus may play out on the ground, on the sea or in the air.”</p>\n<p>It was clear that the new phenomenon of Russia-China entente would dwarf the significance of less important issues; and we could not be sure Biden would be appropriately informed. He wasn’t.</p>\n<h2><b>The Chinese “Squeeze”</b></h2>\n<p>President Biden did not get the word. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://original.antiwar.com/mcgovern/2021/12/05/biden-putin-talk-tuesday-with-xi-in-the-wings/\">Here is the bizarre way Biden described</a>, at his post-summit presser, his decades-behind-the-times approach to Putin on China:</p>\n<p>“Without quoting him [Putin] – which I don’t think is appropriate – let me ask a rhetorical question: You got a multi-thousand-mile border with China. China is seeking to be the most powerful economy in the world and the largest and the most powerful military in the world.”</p>\n<p>At the airport, Biden’s co-travelers did their best to whisk him onto the plane, but failed to stop him from sharing more of his views on China – this time on China’s strategic “squeezing” of Russia:</p>\n<p>“Let me choose my words. Russia is in a very, very difficult spot right now. They are being squeezed by China.”</p>\n<p>Have Biden’s innocent advisers, by now, sought out new textbooks, updated from the ones they may have read in the 70s and 80s. Have they learned that Russia and China have never been closer – that, indeed, they have what amounts to a virtual military alliance?</p>\n<h2><b>Why This Matters</b></h2>\n<p>Back to what may be in store for U.S. warships should they try to enter the Taiwan Strait “in the coming weeks.” Will China try to impede or harass them?</p>\n<p>Experts on China tell me there is low likelihood of that, and I defer to their judgment. At the same time I cannot banish from memory what they told me before Russia invaded Ukraine; namely, that China’s principled stand against interference in the affairs of other countries would make it impossible for China to support such an invasion. And yet, the Chinese have been in the forefront of defending it, explaining that Russia’s “core interests” are at stake. Bejing is now reminding all that Taiwan is a “core interest” of China.</p>\n<p>Would the Chinese expect Russia to have their back, so to speak, if they moved to interdict or harass US warships in the Strait? I believe they would expect that. Russia’s immediate endorsement of China’s policies on the Pelosi visit is one tangible sign pointing in this direction. (Use your imagination and pick the various ways President Putin could up the ante so as to advantage his friend and ally Xi Jinping.)</p>\n<p>Is this worth testing by trying to sail into the Taiwan Strait? Only an innocent hawk would think so. And yet the Chinese have every reason to believe that it is the hawks who are calling the shots in Washington – not Biden. (I discuss some of these issues in a short interview I gave early yesterday <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THTCqiGiFP4\">Sunday</a>, though the connection dropped at minute 8:40.)</p>\n<p>[embedded content]</p>\n<p><i>Bottom line:</i> The White House has left little incentive for the Chinese to keep pushing what they call a “Win-Win” policy. According to reliable sources, when top Chinese officials pressed the mutual advantages of “Win-Win” with White House National Security Council China guru Kurt Campbell, they were set back at his response. They described it as “Your win-win<i> IS BULLSH*T!</i>.”</p>\n<p>Aside from the use of vernacular, this is not difficult to believe, given what is known about Campbell, who very early on said <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/biden-s-asia-czar-says-era-of-engagement-with-xi-s-china-is-over/t_blank\">“the era of engagement is over.”</a> Sadly, Campbell is no wiser than the Bobbsey twins with respect to the implications for the US of the virtual alliance that now exists between China and Russia.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

By the 1960s, the city became known as one of the first municipalities where African Americans would rise up in rebellion on the north side during the late August 1964.</p>\n<p>Max Stanford (later known as Muhammad Ahmed), a co-founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) in 1962, was from Philadelphia. RAM proceeded the Black Panther Party (BPP) and sought to form an alliance with Malcolm X (also known as El Hajj Malik Shabazz), a leading spokesman for the Nation of Islam and later the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). RAM advocated for the development of a revolutionary movement in the U.S. and consequently became a target of the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>In 1969, Mumia joined the Black Panther Party at the age of 15 when the organization was deemed by the then Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) J. Edgar Hoover as the “greatest threat to national security” in the United States. The Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) had a special division which was designed to monitor, disrupt, imprison and kill various leaders and members of African American organizations from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the BPP as well as a host of other tendencies. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) since the mid-to-late 1970s indicate that the BPP was a principal target of the U.S. government and local police agencies.</p>\n<p>Why was the BPP considered so dangerous by the leading law-enforcement agency inside the country? In order to provide answers to this question it must be remembered that between 1955 and 1970, the African American people led a struggle for civil rights and self-determination which impacted broad segments of the population in the U.S. helping to spawn movements within other oppressed communities.</p>\n<p>The Black Panther Party was first formed in Lowndes County Alabama in 1965. Its origins grew out of the organizing work of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), whose field organizer, Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) was deployed to the area in the aftermath of the Selma to Montgomery march in late March of the same year. Working in conjunction with local activists, an independent political party was formed known as the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO). The group utilized the black panther as its symbol while rejecting both the Republican and Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>In subsequent months, there were other Black Panther organizations formed in several cities including Detroit, Cleveland, New York City and other urban areas. In Oakland, California during October of 1966, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.</p>\n<p>This movement represented an emerging phase of the Black liberation struggle where there were calls for armed self-defense, mass rebellion and the political takeovers of major municipalities by those who had been excluded from the reins of official power. Thousands of African American youth flocked to the Black Panther Party viewing the organization as a symbol of uncompromising resistance to racism, national oppression and economic exploitation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Mumia and the BPP</strong></h2>\n<p>Although the BPP was projected in the national corporate media as gun toting militants willing to use weapons against the police when they were threatening the Party and the community, most of the work of the organization revolved around distribution of its weekly newspaper, the establishment of free breakfast programs for children, community health clinics for the people in the most oppressed areas of the African American community while building alliances with revolutionary forces among other sectors of the population including, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Asians, Native Americans and whites committed to fundamental change within U.S. society.</p>\n<p>Mumia noted the diversity of programmatic work during his tenure in the BPP of the late 1960s and early 1970s in his book entitled “We Want Freedom”:</p>\n<p>“As the Breakfast program succeeded so did the Party, and its popularity fueled our growth across the country. Along with the growth of the Party came an increase in the number of community programs undertaken by the Party. By 1971, the Party had embarked on ten distinctive community programs, described by Newton as survival programs. What did he mean by this term? We called them survival programs pending revolution. They were designed to help the people survive until their consciousness is raised, which is only the first step in the revolution to produce a new America.… During a flood the raft is a life-saving device, but it is only a means of getting to higher ground. So, too, with survival programs, which are emergency services. In themselves they do not change social conditions, but they are life-saving vehicles until conditions change.” See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.commonnotions.org/blog/tag/Mumia+Abu-Jamal\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>On December 4, 1969, the Chicago police under the aegis of the Illinois State’s Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan and the Chicago field office of the FBI, raided the residence of BPP members on the city’s west side. Two Panther leaders, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed while several other occupants of the house were wounded.</p>\n<p>These police actions along with hundreds of other attacks on BPP chapters across the country resulted in the deaths of many Panther members and the arrests and framing of hundreds of cadres. Numerous BPP members were driven into exile as others were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Voice of the Voiceless from the Streets to Death Row</strong></h2>\n<p>On December 9, 1981, Mumia was arrested in Philadelphia and charged with the murder of white police officer Daniel Faulkner. He was railroaded through the courts and convicted on July 3, 1982. The following year, Mumia was sentenced to die by capital punishment. He remained on death row until 2011 after an international campaign to save his life proved successful.</p>\n<p>However, his death sentence was commuted to life in prison without parole. Mumia and his supporters have maintained that he is not guilty of the crime of killing a police officer.</p>\n<p>After his sojourn in the BPP, Mumia utilized his writing and journalist skills learned in the Party to become a formidable media personality in Philadelphia. He was a fierce critic of police brutality and a defender of the revolutionary MOVE organization which emerged during the 1970s in the city.</p>\n<p>Mumia was a co-founder of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in the 1970s. He worked as a radio broadcaster and writer exposing the misconduct of the police surrounding the attack on the MOVE residence in August 1978. In 1979, he interviewed reggae superstar Bob Marley when he visited Philadelphia for a concert performance.</p>\n<p>While behind bars Mumia has become an even more prolific writer and broadcast journalist. He issues weekly commentaries through Prison Radio where he discusses a myriad of topics including African American history, international affairs, political economy, the deplorable conditions existing among the more than two million people incarcerated in the U.S. along with police misconduct. (See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prisonradio.org/correspondent/mumia-abu-jamal/\">this</a>)</p>\n<p>A renewed campaign entitled “Love Not Phear” held demonstrations around the U.S. and the world during the weekend of July 3 marking the 40th anniversary of his unjust conviction in 1982. Love Not Phear says that it is committed to the liberation of all political prisoners including Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>\n<p>An entry on their website emphasizes that:</p>\n<p>“The landscape has changed over the last 40 years, a time frame that also marks the years Mumia has been incarcerated. The fight for the release of political prisoners requires a recalibration in order to challenge police corruption and racism as they have evolved in this new landscape. We cannot deny the racism, corruption, and misconduct that permeated the so-called ‘Halls of Justice’ during Mumia’s arrest and unjust kangaroo court trial. The people today know the truth; commonplace bribed witnesses, suppressed evidence, biased judges, and backroom deals put Mumia behind bars.” (See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lovenotphear.com/\">this</a>)</p>\n<p>Mumia through his attorneys have filed another appeal based upon evidence related to prosecutorial misconduct which has been further revealed over the last four years. The hearing will take place on October 19 in Philadelphia. Supporters of Mumia and other political prisoners will attend the hearing in this latest attempt to win the long-awaited freedom for this activist who is now 68 years old.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The source is the MMWR report of August 11, 2022. The title alone shows just how deeply the about-face was buried: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7133e1.htm\">Summary of Guidance for Minimizing the Impact of COVID-19 on Individual Persons, Communities, and Health Care Systems — United States, August 2022</a>. </em></p>\n<p>The authors: “the CDC Emergency Response Team” consisting of “Greta M. Massetti, PhD; Brendan R. Jackson, MD; John T. Brooks, MD; Cria G. Perrine, PhD; Erica Reott, MPH; Aron J. Hall, DVM; Debra Lubar, PhD;; Ian T. Williams, PhD; Matthew D. Ritchey, DPT; Pragna Patel, MD; Leandris C. Liburd, PhD; Barbara E. Mahon, MD.”</p>\n<p>It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall in the brainstorming sessions that led to this little treatise. The wording was chosen very carefully, not to say anything false outright, much less admit any errors of the past, but to imply that it was only possible to say these things now.</p>\n<p>“As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, <strong>continues to circulate globally</strong>, high levels of vaccine- and <strong>infection-induced immunity</strong> and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post–COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death. These circumstances now allow public health efforts to <strong>minimize the individual and societal health impacts</strong> of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce <strong>medically significant illness</strong> as well as to <strong>minimize strain </strong>on the health care system, while<strong> reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity.</strong>“</p>\n<p>In English:<em> everyone can pretty much go back to normal</em>. Focus on illness that is medically significant. Stop worrying about positive cases because nothing is going to stop them. Think about the bigger picture of overall social health. End the compulsion. Thank you. It’s only two and a half years late.</p>\n<p>What about mass testing?</p>\n<p>Forget it: “All persons should seek testing for active infection when they are <strong>symptomatic</strong> or if they have a known or suspected exposure to someone with COVID-19.”</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>What about the magic of track and trace?</p>\n<p>“CDC now recommends case investigation and contact tracing <strong>only</strong> in health care settings and certain high-risk congregate settings.”</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>What about the unvaccinated who were so demonized throughout the last year?</p>\n<p>“CDC’s COVID-19 prevention recommendations<strong> no longer differentiate based on a person’s vaccination status </strong>because breakthrough infections occur, though they are generally mild, and persons who have had COVID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection.”</p>\n<p>Remember when 40% of the members of the black community in New York City who refused the jab were not allowed into restaurants, bars, libraries, museums, or theaters? Now, no one wants to talk about that.</p>\n<p>Also, universities, colleges, the military, and so on – which still have mandates in place – do you hear this? Everything you have done to hate on people, dehumanize people, segregate people, humiliate others as unclean, fire people and destroy lives, now stands in disrepute.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as of this writing, the blasted US government still will not allow unvaccinated travelers across its borders!</p>\n<p>Not one word of the CDC’s turgid treatise was untrue back in the Spring of 2020. There was always “infection-induced immunity,” though Fauci and Co. constantly pretended otherwise. It was always a terrible idea to introduce “barriers to social, educational, and economic activity.” The vaccines never promised in their authorization to stop infection and spread, even though all official statements of the CDC claimed otherwise, repeatedly and often.</p>\n<p>You might also wonder how the great reversal treats masking. On this subject, there is no backing off. After all, the Biden administration still has an appeal in process to reverse the court decision that the mask mandate was illegal all along. “At the high COVID-19 Community Level,” the CDC adds, “additional recommendations focus on all persons <strong>wearing masks indoors </strong>in public and further increasing protection to populations at high risk.”</p>\n<p>The problem from the beginning was that there never was an exit strategy from the crazy lockdown/mandate idea. It was never the case that they would magically cause the bug to go away. The excuse that we would lock down in wait for a vaccine never made any sense.</p>\n<p>People surely knew early on of the social, economic, and cultural devastation that would ensue. If they did not, they never should have been anywhere near the control switches of public health. Badges and bureaucracies do not terrify a virus destined to spread to the whole planet. And not one person with even the most casual passing knowledge of coronaviruses could have sincerely believed that a vaccine would magically appear to achieve something never before achieved in the whole history of medicine.</p>\n<p>When the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gbdeclaration.org/\">Great Barrington Declaration</a> appeared on October 4, 2020, it caused a global frenzy of fury not because it said anything new. It was merely a pithy restatement of basic public-health principles, which pretty much instantly became verboten on March 16, 2020, when Fauci/Birx announced their grand scheme.</p>\n<p>The GBD generated mania because the existing praxis was based on preposterously unproven claims that demanded that billions of people buy into complete nonsense. Sadly many did simply because it seemed hard to believe that all world regimes but a handful would push such a damaging policy if it was utterly unworkable. When something like that happens – and there never was the hope that it could work – the regime imperative becomes censorship and shaming of dissent. It’s the only way to hold the great lie together.</p>\n<p>So finally, nearly two years later the CDC has embraced the Great Barrington Declaration rather than doing a “quick and devastating takedown” as Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci called for the day after its release. No, they had to try out their new theory on the rest of us. It did not work, obviously. For the authors of the GBD, they knew from the time they penned the document that it was a matter of time before they were vindicated. They never doubted it.</p>\n<p>Dr. Rajeev Venkayya is widely <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://brownstone.org/articles/how-fanatics-took-over-the-world/\">credited</a> with coming up with the idea of lockdowns while he was working for the Bush administration back in 2005. He had no training at all in public health or epidemiology. He later marveled that it fell to him, a young desk-dwelling White House bureaucrat, to “invent pandemic planning.” Maybe he should have demurred that day that George W. Bush asked him to lead the charge to inaugurate a new war on pathogens.</p>\n<p>Somehow his views gained converts, among whom was Bill Gates, the foundation for whom he worked for years. The rest is history.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, Venkayya called me to explain why I needed to stop attacking lockdowns. He said that the planners need a chance to make their scheme work.</p>\n<p>On the phone, I asked the same question over and over: where does the virus go? The first two times, he did not respond. I pressed and pressed. Finally he said there will be a vaccine.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to appreciate just how preposterous that sounded at the time, and I said something along those lines: it would be a medical miracle never before seen to have a shot for a coronavirus that was sterilizing against wild type and all inevitable mutations, and to do it in a reasonable time so that society and economy had not completely fallen apart.</p>\n<p>The whole approach was clearly milliennarian at best and utter madness at worst. And here I was, in the thick of global lockdowns, on the phone with the architect of the whole idea, an idea that had reduced billions to servitude, wrecked schools and churches, and sent communities and countries into complete upheaval. I wondered at the time what it would be like to be Dr. Venkayya that day. After all this ended in disaster, would he take responsibility? His LinkedIn profile today says otherwise: he is prepared to “tackle current and future epidemic & pandemic threats as the CEO of Aerium Therapeutics.”</p>\n<p>There never was an exit strategy from lockdowns and mandates but they eventually did find an exit nonetheless. It came in the form of a heavily footnoted and opaquely written reversal, published by the main bureaucracy responsible for the disaster. It amounts to a repudiation without saying so. And thus does the great experiment in mass compulsion come to an intellectual end. If only the carnage could be cleaned up by another posting on the CDC’s website.</p>\n<p>By the way, the Biden administration has extended the declaration of Covid emergency. And my unvaccinated friends in the UK still can’t board a plane to come for a visit.</p>\n<p>All of this gives rise to the great question: what was the point? Maybe it was all a mistake and now it is gone forever but that’s unlikely. The intellectuals who pushed this project on the world have a view of the world that is fundamentally ill-liberal. They differ among themselves on the details but the general approach is technocratic central planning rooted in deep suspicion of basic tenets of freedom.</p>\n<p>How many people on the planet have now been acculturated to top-down control, socialized to live in fear, accept whatever comes down from above, never to question an edict, and expect to live in a world of rolling man-made disasters? And was that the point after all, to cultivate low expectations for life on earth and relinquish the soul’s desire for a full and free life?</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

People’s World was invited to attend this important event. The goal was to raise awareness and funds for Agent Orange clean up and for resources to care for the victims.</em></p>\n<p>The program opened with remarks from<strong> Senior Lt. General Nguyen Van Trinh</strong>, director of VAVA. The program then shared some success stories, such as the clearing of Da Nang International Airport of the remaining dioxin. Examples of other places still in the process of being cleared were also shared. The program featured interviews with victims, their families, and their caregivers.</p>\n<p>The program ended with thanking various people from across Vietnam that have raised funds, donated, or volunteered to help those suffering the ill effects of the toxins. This aid came from across the social and economic spectrum. Philanthropists, students, youth groups, and other grassroots initiatives were all well represented.</p>\n<p>Starting in August 1961, until the end of the war in 1973, the U.S. military dropped Agent Orange and similar chemical weapons on 5.6 million acres of Vietnamese land. Over 90% of these lands were poisoned at least twice. By the end of the war, an estimated five million Vietnamese people were poisoned by these illegal weapons.</p>\n<p>But the crime didn’t end with the U.S. retreat from Vietnam. The awful effects of Agent Orange have been passed down from parent to child and from child to grandchild. This means that every year there are new victims born. Every year there are new victims that suffer the horrible disabilities and deformities caused by the toxins in Agent Orange and other dioxin weapons. Today, there are nearly 4.8 million Vietnamese still suffering from the toxins first dropped on Vietnam 61 years ago.</p>\n<p>Despite many promises made by the U.S. government to help the Vietnamese government and people with the aftermath of the U.S.’ illegal warfare, aid has been lacking. To date, 61 years later, the U.S. government has only ever helped with environmental cleanup and has never provided any help for the millions of people that suffered and continue to suffer from dioxin poisoning.</p>\n<p>Today, <strong>Rep. Barbara Lee,</strong> D-Calif., remains the only consistent voice calling for the U.S. government to take responsibility for its past crimes in Vietnam. Year after year, Lee proposes legislation to help care for the victims of Agent Orange. She is joined by the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vn-agentorange.org/\">Vietnam Agent Orange Relief & Responsibility Campaign</a> (VAORRC) and other advocacy groups that try and lobby for funding for the victims. Unfortunately, year after year, the rest of Congress fails to give the initiative enough support, leading to its failure.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the victims of Agent Orange were not exclusively those bombed by the U.S. military. Many U.S. veterans who handled and managed the containers of the chemicals and their decedents fell ill due to their handling of the toxins. While some veterans did receive <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/toxic-legacy-part-2-fighting-for-justice-after-chemical-warfare-in-vietnam/\">minimal compensation</a>, the chemical companies that made the toxins have been protected by the U.S. courts from having to take any responsibility for their crimes.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that the U.S. government was running <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/after-months-of-denial-u-s-admits-to-running-ukraine-biolabs/\">biological labs in Ukraine</a>. This horrifying revelation suggests the lessons from history have not been learned. While other countries seek to ban the use of unconventional weapons and create safeguards to deter their use, the U.S. military still goes in the other direction.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Edgar Hoover</strong>, whose obsession with communism and “subversion” allowed him to justify violating the civil rights and civil liberties of millions of Americans.</em></p>\n<p>Under COINTELPRO, which Hoover initiated in 1956, the F.B.I. surveilled, infiltrated, discredited, disrupted, burglarized and harassed American citizens and organizations as diverse as the Communist Party USA, anti-Vietnam War protestors, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, the American Indian Movement, environmentalists, animal rights organizations, Puerto Rican nationalists and even the National Lawyers’ Guild.</p>\n<p>The program continued until 1971, when a group of progressive activists <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Burglary-Discovery-Edgar-Hoovers-Secret/dp/0804173664/ref=sr_1_1?crid=119UTDBCN7R0R&keywords=the+burglary+by+betty+medsger&qid=1660254827&sprefix=the+burglary,aps,118&sr=8-1\">broke into an F.B.I. field office</a> in Media, Pennsylvania, stole documents related to COINTEPRO, and sent them to the press.  Nobody in the F.B.I. was ever punished for the program’s many illegalities, but the “burglars” who revealed the program were hunted for decades.  None were ever caught.</p>\n<p>And now, 51 years after it ended, a bill has been introduced to the U.S. Congress that would expose still classified details of the F.B.I.’s abuse of power.</p>\n<p><strong>Rep. Bobby Rush</strong> (D-IL) on May 4 sponsored the legislation that would do some exciting things.  The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2998\">COINTELPRO Full Disclosure Act</a> would require the U.S. federal government to publicly disclose, within six months of being signed into law, all records related to the F.B.I.’s illegal COINTELPRO operation “that would not cause harm” to the national security.</p>\n<p>It would also establish something called the “COINTELPRO Records Review Board” to review determinations by government offices that do not fully disclose their records after six months.  To top it off, the bill would also require the removal of J. Edgar Hoover’s name from the F.B.I.’s headquarters building in Washington.</p>\n<p>The measure was assigned to the House Oversight and Reform Committee as well as to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  A day later, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.  There has been no action on the bill since May, and no concurrent bills have been sponsored in the Senate.</p>\n<h2><strong>The FBI’s Aims</strong></h2>\n<p>COINTELPRO had specific goals.  According to the book <em>Surveillance and Governance: Crime Control and Beyond</em> by Mathieu Deflam, F.B.I. agents were tasked with creating a negative public image for the groups and people targeted; breaking down the organizations by creating internal conflicts; creating dissension among groups that otherwise might be allied; restricting access to public resources, such as through non-profits; restricting the ability to organize protests, such as by having F.B.I. agents who had infiltrated the groups threaten violence against police or initiate violence; and restricting the ability of individuals to participate in group activities through character assassination, rumor, innuendo, and false arrests.</p>\n<p>MIT professor and activist Noam Chomsky <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03js1k4\">told the BBC</a> in 1996,</p>\n<p>“COINTELPRO was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks, but by the national political police, the F.B.I., under four administrations.  By the time it got through, it was aimed at the entire New Left, at the women’s movement, at the whole Black movement.  It was extremely broad.  Its actions went as far as political assassination.”</p>\n<p>Certainly, the F.B.I. carried out political assassinations against members of the Black Panther Party.  An even better known COINTELPRO target, though, was Martin Luther King.  Immediately following the 1963 March on Washington, F.B.I. Special Agent William Sullivan, the officer in charge of COINTELPRO, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/enemieshistoryof0000wein_w8s0\">wrote to Hoover</a>, saying,</p>\n<p>“In light of King’s powerful demagogic speech (the “I Have a Dream” speech), we must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" srcset=\"https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k.jpg 2048w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-500x333.jpg 500w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-1000x665.jpg 1000w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-768x511.jpg 768w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-160x106.jpg 160w\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"557\" height=\"370\" /></p>\n<p><span>F.B.I. headquarters in Washington.

That data include quantities of DINP-category chemicals released into the environment or otherwise managed as waste.</p>\n<p>The Toxics Release Inventory is meant to give the public information about chemicals at facilities in their area, how they are being managed, and if they are being released into the environment.

That data, she added, can be used by researchers to analyze health and environmental impacts in studies such as health and life-cycle assessments.</p>\n<p>Taylor noted two other striking takeaways from Monday’s decision:</p>\n<p>First, federal regulators first raised alarm about health impacts associated with the chemical in 2000. “This is a clear example of the glacial pace of the review process at EPA,” she said.</p>\n<p>Second, the ruling covers a class of chemicals, rather than a specific one – suggesting the EPA is “inching towards” policies that regulate chemicals by class. “This is something being strongly recommended by independent scientists who research chemicals such as phthalates, bisphenols and other endocrine disruptors used to make plastics,” Taylor said.</p>\n<p>“Such restrictions by class would prevent some of the ‘regrettable substitutions\'” – many compounds used in “BPA-free” products are just as harmful as BPA, for instance – “which are now standard practice by industries when faced with information that a chemical in their product is harmful to health or the environment.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

He gave bin Salman a pass for Khashoggi’s murder—and for hundreds of thousands murdered in Yemen—precisely to buy more oil at lower prices (which, in fact, for all his pandering, he did not succeed in getting, returning home from his Middle East trip embarrassingly empty-handed).</p>\n<p>So it is no surprise that Biden caved to pressure from the intelligence community, and is pursuing the same warped vendetta against Julian Assange as Trump’s former CIA Director, Mike Pompeo. The Biden administration is brutally murdering Assange just as deliberately as bin Salman murdered Khashoggi—and for the same reason—because Assange exposed incriminating information that the government wanted to cover up.</p>\n<p>In a just world, Assange would be celebrated for exposing deceit, corruption and criminal behavior. Instead, he is being victimized on behalf of the very criminals whose crimes he exposed.</p>\n<p>Most upsetting of all is how Assange has been abandoned by his former media partners at <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Le Monde</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>El Pais</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em>. This abandonment is ironic, since the secret documents that Assange gave them to publish—and for which they earned numerous journalistic accolades—are the very documents for which the U.S. is indicting Assange under the Espionage Act.</p>\n<p>Assange’s crime was to tell the American public about the evil its government was committing in its name. The <em>public’s </em>crime would be to allow him to be imprisoned for life by the very government that committed those crimes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=565,476&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?w=565&ssl=1 565w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=300%2C253&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=150%2C126&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"568\" height=\"478\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/16/giant-satirical-billboards-mounted-on-trucks-driven-all-over-the-nations-capital-are-publicly-shaming-democratic-party-leaders-for-their-illegal-persecution-of-julian-assange/image-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=565%2C476&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"565,476\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"image-6\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=300%2C253&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=565%2C476&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Billboard truck driving past Washington Monument.

They are alerting the public to this parody of justice, and hopefully will pressure Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop the case against Assange.</p>\n<p>If the U.S. government succeeds in jailing Assange for revealing its crimes, it will kill independent investigative journalism forever. It will allow any journalist, from any country in the world, who dares to reveal U.S. crimes, to be extradited for treason, dragged to this country, and imprisoned.</p>\n<p>If you want to support Credico’s mobile billboard campaign to free Assange (it requires money to keep those trucks rolling), you can make a donation <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.assangecountdowntofreedom.com/billboard?s=03\">HERE.</a></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 1: Randy Credico </strong>is a recent winner of an “Award for Journalistic Excellence” from the Society for Independent Investigative Journalism. He hosts the influential radio and podcast series <strong>Assange: Countdown to Freedom </strong>and is a tireless creator of “awareness events” to generate public and political pressure for release of the most important publisher of the 21<sup>st </sup>century.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 2: </strong>Credico first tried to buy billboard space for his “Free Assange” campaign from Clear Channel, the world’s largest outdoor media company, whose billboards dominate the entire DC area. But Clear Channel is tightly tied to the U.S. extreme right, and–no surprise—refused to run billboards urging (gasp!) freedom for a Hillary-hugging, Russia-loving traitor like Julian Assange. “Your billboards don’t meet our community standards,” he was told.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Randy was rescued by the plucky owner of a one-man outdoor media company called <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dcmobileads.com/\">DC Mobile Ads</a>, who convinced Randy to forget about traditional billboards and put his campaign on wheels—which he happily did. The company owner loves the billboards so much that he volunteered to drive one of the trucks all over D.C. himself.

He gave bin Salman a pass for Khashoggi’s murder—and for hundreds of thousands murdered in Yemen—precisely to buy more oil at lower prices (which, in fact, for all his pandering, he did not succeed in getting, returning home from his Middle East trip embarrassingly empty-handed).</p>\n<p>So it is no surprise that Biden caved to pressure from the intelligence community, and is pursuing the same warped vendetta against Julian Assange as Trump’s former CIA Director, Mike Pompeo. The Biden administration is brutally murdering Assange just as deliberately as bin Salman murdered Khashoggi—and for the same reason—because Assange exposed incriminating information that the government wanted to cover up.</p>\n<p>In a just world, Assange would be celebrated for exposing deceit, corruption and criminal behavior. Instead, he is being victimized on behalf of the very criminals whose crimes he exposed.</p>\n<p>Most upsetting of all is how Assange has been abandoned by his former media partners at <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Le Monde</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>El Pais</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em>. This abandonment is ironic, since the secret documents that Assange gave them to publish—and for which they earned numerous journalistic accolades—are the very documents for which the U.S. is indicting Assange under the Espionage Act.</p>\n<p>Assange’s crime was to tell the American public about the evil its government was committing in its name. The <em>public’s </em>crime would be to allow him to be imprisoned for life by the very government that committed those crimes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=565,476&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?w=565&ssl=1 565w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=300%2C253&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=150%2C126&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"568\" height=\"478\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/16/giant-satirical-billboards-mounted-on-trucks-driven-all-over-the-nations-capital-are-publicly-shaming-democratic-party-leaders-for-their-illegal-persecution-of-julian-assange/image-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=565%2C476&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"565,476\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"image-6\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=300%2C253&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=565%2C476&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Billboard truck driving past Washington Monument.

They are alerting the public to this parody of justice, and hopefully will pressure Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop the case against Assange.</p>\n<p>If the U.S. government succeeds in jailing Assange for revealing its crimes, it will kill independent investigative journalism forever. It will allow any journalist, from any country in the world, who dares to reveal U.S. crimes, to be extradited for treason, dragged to this country, and imprisoned.</p>\n<p>If you want to support Credico’s mobile billboard campaign to free Assange (it requires money to keep those trucks rolling), you can make a donation <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.assangecountdowntofreedom.com/billboard?s=03\">HERE.</a></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 1: Randy Credico </strong>is a recent winner of an “Award for Journalistic Excellence” from the Society for Independent Investigative Journalism. He hosts the influential radio and podcast series <strong>Assange: Countdown to Freedom </strong>and is a tireless creator of “awareness events” to generate public and political pressure for release of the most important publisher of the 21<sup>st </sup>century.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 2: </strong>Credico first tried to buy billboard space for his “Free Assange” campaign from Clear Channel, the world’s largest outdoor media company, whose billboards dominate the entire DC area. But Clear Channel is tightly tied to the U.S. extreme right, and–no surprise—refused to run billboards urging (gasp!) freedom for a Hillary-hugging, Russia-loving traitor like Julian Assange. “Your billboards don’t meet our community standards,” he was told.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Randy was rescued by the plucky owner of a one-man outdoor media company called <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dcmobileads.com/\">DC Mobile Ads</a>, who convinced Randy to forget about traditional billboards and put his campaign on wheels—which he happily did. The company owner loves the billboards so much that he volunteered to drive one of the trucks all over D.C. himself.

But there is one exception to that generalization, though one hesitates to call it a benefit, consisting of the White House’s adoption of the Israel practice of referring to opponents as “terrorists.” Israel uses it as a generic cover designation to denigrate and humiliate the Palestinians while also delegitimizing their resistance, permitting them to torture and kill Arabs at will, destroy their homes, and bomb them mercilessly. Washington, which claims to be the font of a “rules based international order” as well as the defender of global “democracy” and “freedom,” has developed since 9/11 an unfortunate tendency to do the same thing as the Israelis to justify its attacks on civilians and its brutal assassination policies.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\">the US and Israel</a> are generally speaking the only two countries that openly use “targeted assassination” as a political tool without even bothering to fall back on “plausible denial” to conceal their actions. Israel only last week, initiated a politically motivated bombing attack on Gaza, which killed 45 civilians, including seventeen children and destroyed numerous homes. No Israelis were killed or even injured when the Gazans struck back with their home-made rockets. Both the White House and leaders in the US Congress congratulated the Israelis for “exercising their right to defend themselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://forward.com/israel/513530/the-one-predictable-outcome-of-the-gaza-operation/\" href=\"https://forward.com/israel/513530/the-one-predictable-outcome-of-the-gaza-operation/\">principal targets</a> of the Israeli onslaught were two Islamic Jihad leaders whom both Israel and the international media have described as “terrorists” and “militants.” The Israeli <strong>Prime Minister Yair Lapid</strong> described the operation as successful as the two men were reported killed.

The media coverage described how the Agency relentlessly stalked al-Zawahiri, described as the mastermind of 9/11, eventually learning that the 71-year-old was living in a house in an upscale Kabul neighborhood. It was also determined that he spent most days sitting on a terrace at the top of the house. The hellfire drone that killed him targeted the terrace at the time of day when he was normally sitting outside. Taliban sources report that his body was torn apart and incinerated by the two missiles that apparently struck him.</span></p>\n<p><span>The White House is, of course, framing the assassination as a great success, a major blow in the war against terror. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is hoping that it will improve the administration’s dismal approval ratings in the lead-up to the November elections, but the information given to the media regarding the incident praising the CIA’s tenacity and professional expertise is perhaps a bit over the top. Alternative reports from Afghanistan suggest that al-Zawahiri was living quite openly in Kabul and that he has not been active in any presumably radical activities for many, many years <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">beyond making</a> a number of “conspiracy theory” videos. Both al-Zawahiri and al-Qaeda founder <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> were, at the times when they were assassinated by the US, leading quiet lives with little protection even though they allegedly continued to be nominal leaders of al-Qaeda, an organization that had lost its <em>raison d’etre</em> years before.</span></p>\n<p><span>Al-Zawahiri’s record as a terrorist comes largely from US and UK intelligence sources as well as media innuendo, which should be automatically considered unreliable. Recall for a moment the lying that the George W. Bush administration engaged in to go to war with Iraq, with folks like Condoleezza Rice speaking of mushroom clouds spewing radiation over the US and a shop in the Pentagon run by a group of neocons producing fabricated intelligence reports. What has been confirmed from independent sources is that al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, was savagely tortured by the secret police during a crackdown on political dissidents initiated by US puppet <strong>President Hosni Mubarak</strong>. The torture reportedly radicalized him, and he joined Osama bin Laden’s underground group, later apparently becoming its nominal leader after bin Laden was himself killed in May 2011 by US Navy Seals. Much of the rest of al-Zawahiri’s presumed biography relies on little in the way of actual evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span>What actually happened on 9/11 and who was behind it remains somewhat a mystery as all the apparent perpetrators of which might have occurred are dead. Consider for a moment that Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri never actually admitted that their group al-Qaeda was the perpetrator of the attack. In fact they denied it, sometimes attributing it to other radicalized Saudi Arabian underground groups. Nor is there any actual evidence that they planned the attack. They were accused because they had the claimed track record, resources, motive and possible access to carry out the incident, not because there was any real evidence that they had done the deed. When the US approached the Taliban government of Afghanistan in late 2001 and demanded that bin Laden be turned over to American law enforcement, the Afghans responded that bin Laden was a guest in their country, but they would surrender him if Washington could demonstrate that he had organized and ordered the attacks. George W. Bush’s Pentagon and the CIA apparently could not make that case based on actual evidence, leading to the decision to go to war instead.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, of all the hundreds of “terrorist” prisoners that have been recycled through <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">the US military prison at Guantanamo</a> only five have ever been charged with any involvement in 9/11. They are still being held but have never been tried and it is quite possible the case against them can never be made. They might even be completely innocent.</span></p>\n<p><span>And there is more to the story. Bin Laden could have been arrested and tried but the Barack Obama administration decided to kill him and dump his body at sea, presumably to avoid a courtroom drama that would reveal government malfeasance. And then there are <strong>Anwar Nasser al-Awlaki</strong> and his son<strong> Abdulrahman</strong>, both of whom were American citizens killed by CIA drones in Yemen, where their family originated. The al-Awlakis may or may not have been actual members of al-Qaeda, but the elder al-Awlaki’s sermons and writings certainly inspired groups that opposed US foreign policy’s hostility towards Muslims. It is widely believed that Anwar al-Awlaki could have been captured and tried in the US if an attempt to do so had been pursued, but instead the Obama Administration again decided that he should be killed.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, there is the death by drone of Iranian <strong>General Qassem Soleimani</strong> in January 2000 under President Donald Trump. In a recent book, Trump’s Defense Chief <strong>Mark Esper</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\">claims that</a> Trump lied after the assassination was criticized by saying that Soleimani was actively preparing “terror” attacks on four American Embassies in the Mideast region. Esper confirms that there was no intelligence to back up that claim, but interestingly goes beyond that to make clear that there was no specific intelligence at all suggesting that such an attack was imminent or even being planned. There were only generic regional security threats that many embassies in the world respond to and make preparations to defend against.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Esper claim is supported by the Iraqi government itself, which declared that Soleimani, widely regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran after the Ayatollah, was in Baghdad to discuss peace arrangements and that the US Embassy had been informed of his planned trip and had raised no objection to it. Instead, the US used the opportunity to launch an armed drone to kill him and nine Iraqi militia members that were accompanying him from the airport. In other words, there was no imminent threat, nor even a plausible threat, and the US went ahead anyway and killed a senior Iranian government official in a targeted assassination.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, the United States and Israel have a formula down pat whereby they can kill anyone anywhere without any due process or rule of law, even if they don’t know who you are as in the cases of the “signature” or “profile” executions by drone in Afghanistan.

But there is one exception to that generalization, though one hesitates to call it a benefit, consisting of the White House’s adoption of the Israel practice of referring to opponents as “terrorists.” Israel uses it as a generic cover designation to denigrate and humiliate the Palestinians while also delegitimizing their resistance, permitting them to torture and kill Arabs at will, destroy their homes, and bomb them mercilessly. Washington, which claims to be the font of a “rules based international order” as well as the defender of global “democracy” and “freedom,” has developed since 9/11 an unfortunate tendency to do the same thing as the Israelis to justify its attacks on civilians and its brutal assassination policies.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\">the US and Israel</a> are generally speaking the only two countries that openly use “targeted assassination” as a political tool without even bothering to fall back on “plausible denial” to conceal their actions. Israel only last week, initiated a politically motivated bombing attack on Gaza, which killed 45 civilians, including seventeen children and destroyed numerous homes. No Israelis were killed or even injured when the Gazans struck back with their home-made rockets.

The media coverage described how the Agency relentlessly stalked al-Zawahiri, described as the mastermind of 9/11, eventually learning that the 71-year-old was living in a house in an upscale Kabul neighborhood. It was also determined that he spent most days sitting on a terrace at the top of the house. The hellfire drone that killed him targeted the terrace at the time of day when he was normally sitting outside. Taliban sources report that his body was torn apart and incinerated by the two missiles that apparently struck him.</span></p>\n<p><span>The White House is, of course, framing the assassination as a great success, a major blow in the war against terror. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is hoping that it will improve the administration’s dismal approval ratings in the lead-up to the November elections, but the information given to the media regarding the incident praising the CIA’s tenacity and professional expertise is perhaps a bit over the top. Alternative reports from Afghanistan suggest that al-Zawahiri was living quite openly in Kabul and that he has not been active in any presumably radical activities for many, many years <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">beyond making</a> a number of “conspiracy theory” videos. Both al-Zawahiri and al-Qaeda founder <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> were, at the times when they were assassinated by the US, leading quiet lives with little protection even though they allegedly continued to be nominal leaders of al-Qaeda, an organization that had lost its <em>raison d’etre</em> years before.</span></p>\n<p><span>Al-Zawahiri’s record as a terrorist comes largely from US and UK intelligence sources as well as media innuendo, which should be automatically considered unreliable. Recall for a moment the lying that the George W. Bush administration engaged in to go to war with Iraq, with folks like Condoleezza Rice speaking of mushroom clouds spewing radiation over the US and a shop in the Pentagon run by a group of neocons producing fabricated intelligence reports. What has been confirmed from independent sources is that al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, was savagely tortured by the secret police during a crackdown on political dissidents initiated by US puppet <strong>President Hosni Mubarak</strong>. The torture reportedly radicalized him, and he joined Osama bin Laden’s underground group, later apparently becoming its nominal leader after bin Laden was himself killed in May 2011 by US Navy Seals. Much of the rest of al-Zawahiri’s presumed biography relies on little in the way of actual evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span>What actually happened on 9/11 and who was behind it remains somewhat a mystery as all the apparent perpetrators of which might have occurred are dead. Consider for a moment that Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri never actually admitted that their group al-Qaeda was the perpetrator of the attack. In fact they denied it, sometimes attributing it to other radicalized Saudi Arabian underground groups. Nor is there any actual evidence that they planned the attack. They were accused because they had the claimed track record, resources, motive and possible access to carry out the incident, not because there was any real evidence that they had done the deed. When the US approached the Taliban government of Afghanistan in late 2001 and demanded that bin Laden be turned over to American law enforcement, the Afghans responded that bin Laden was a guest in their country, but they would surrender him if Washington could demonstrate that he had organized and ordered the attacks. George W. Bush’s Pentagon and the CIA apparently could not make that case based on actual evidence, leading to the decision to go to war instead.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, of all the hundreds of “terrorist” prisoners that have been recycled through <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">the US military prison at Guantanamo</a> only five have ever been charged with any involvement in 9/11. They are still being held but have never been tried and it is quite possible the case against them can never be made. They might even be completely innocent.</span></p>\n<p><span>And there is more to the story. Bin Laden could have been arrested and tried but the Barack Obama administration decided to kill him and dump his body at sea, presumably to avoid a courtroom drama that would reveal government malfeasance. And then there are <strong>Anwar Nasser al-Awlaki</strong> and his son<strong> Abdulrahman</strong>, both of whom were American citizens killed by CIA drones in Yemen, where their family originated. The al-Awlakis may or may not have been actual members of al-Qaeda, but the elder al-Awlaki’s sermons and writings certainly inspired groups that opposed US foreign policy’s hostility towards Muslims. It is widely believed that Anwar al-Awlaki could have been captured and tried in the US if an attempt to do so had been pursued, but instead the Obama Administration again decided that he should be killed.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, there is the death by drone of Iranian <strong>General Qassem Soleimani</strong> in January 2000 under President Donald Trump. In a recent book, Trump’s Defense Chief <strong>Mark Esper</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\">claims that</a> Trump lied after the assassination was criticized by saying that Soleimani was actively preparing “terror” attacks on four American Embassies in the Mideast region. Esper confirms that there was no intelligence to back up that claim, but interestingly goes beyond that to make clear that there was no specific intelligence at all suggesting that such an attack was imminent or even being planned. There were only generic regional security threats that many embassies in the world respond to and make preparations to defend against.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Esper claim is supported by the Iraqi government itself, which declared that Soleimani, widely regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran after the Ayatollah, was in Baghdad to discuss peace arrangements and that the US Embassy had been informed of his planned trip and had raised no objection to it. Instead, the US used the opportunity to launch an armed drone to kill him and nine Iraqi militia members that were accompanying him from the airport. In other words, there was no imminent threat, nor even a plausible threat, and the US went ahead anyway and killed a senior Iranian government official in a targeted assassination.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, the United States and Israel have a formula down pat whereby they can kill anyone anywhere without any due process or rule of law, even if they don’t know who you are as in the cases of the “signature” or “profile” executions by drone in Afghanistan. And all the presidents and senior officials know that no matter what they do there will be no accountability. All one has to do is call it terrorism prevention, which might include citing terrorist attacks that can in no way be linked by way of actual evidence to the person being killed. Once a terrorist, always a terrorist, repeat as needed, and the public and media will swoon with pleasure at being so well-protected. And, as the Israeli general described it, the end result will be “really clean, very nice” an “exceptional achievement.”</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

It is aimed disproportionately at people of color, as well as others engaged in anti-racist struggle. Whether in the fight against racism at home or against racist foreign policies, wars, occupation and colonialism, the overarching purpose of political imprisonment is to intimidate and try to crush militant forms of anti-racist struggle.</em></p>\n<p>By treating U.S. political prisoners as “common criminals,” the criminal justice system individualizes each case as if they are somehow separate from their social contexts. This ignores root causes and impedes the development of political solutions to the underlying issues for which people have been arrested.</p>\n<p>Readers can discern for themselves what is revealed in the findings presented here, and in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">US Political Prisoner list</a> this article analyzes. The large number of people of color and others involved in the anti-racist struggle arrested for their activities is sadly predictable. Our entire history and existing political and economic institutions are founded and advanced squarely on the foundations of racism.</p>\n<p>The problem is the entire U.S. social, political and economic apparatus. It’s the system that must change. Only when that happens will political prisoners find justice and true liberation in the U.S. We fight for the liberation of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal. But as wonderful as winning freedom for individuals may be, without a political solution, little is accomplished regarding the causes for which these prisoners have sacrificed their freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=432,288&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?w=432&ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"A poster with a group of people\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence\" width=\"524\" height=\"349\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"432,288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-political-prisoners-in-usa\">syracuseculturalworkers.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Not all U.S. political prisoners are in jail for explicitly anti-racist struggles. There are those in prison for opposing the whole fabric of militarism and war, women who have defended their bodies from abuse, striking blows against patriarchy, and eco-defenders.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the racism that permeates U.S. political imprisonment does not diminish the validity of the struggles for which they were arrested. Without exception, racism and anti-racism is a factor in every facet of U.S. popular movements. For instance, all anti-war and anti-imperialist struggle has a fundamentally anti-racist aspect. The one existing imperial power in the world today is the U.S./NATO Empire, an Empire centered among mostly White nations, in service to global capitalism and western geopolitical hegemony. That Empire is the primary global purveyor of the exploitation and dispossession of Black, Indigenous, and other colonized peoples in the nations of the Global South.</p>\n<p>We further recognize that we can and must look to anti-racist struggles, especially Black and Indigenous liberation, for guidance, lessons, and leadership, regardless the area of activity. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/racism-liberation-and-us-political-prisoners\">Alliance for Global Justice analysis published August 5, 2020</a> (which this paper updates), explains that,</p>\n<p>“…We are convinced that African people, including the African diaspora, play a leading role in all revolutionary and transformational struggles. African and Indigenous peoples have been specially targeted for repression and exploitation from the very beginning days of the global spread of capitalism. Today, in the U.S., the movement for the rights and self-determination of Black people has, above all else, shown that it is not a temporary struggle but that it has staying power.</p>\n<p>There is a thread that connects the struggles of the very first enslaved people through the historic Civil Rights Movement to the… Black Lives Matter uprisings today. The struggle for Black liberation in the U.S. is huge, mature yet young: multigenerational, experienced, politically savvy, and enduring. The successes of Black liberation struggles have always, in every instance, opened the way for other struggles. The struggles against slavery and for Black voting rights led directly to the women’s suffrage movement. The Civil Rights Movement was a foundation for an endless list of struggles, including anti-war, anti-poverty, women’s rights, Latin American and Asian liberation movements, disability rights, gay rights, and more. (Indigenous defense of the land and its people is, of course, the oldest movement in resistance to Empire in the Americas.) Thus, we can say that the prominence of African heritage political prisoners in the U.S. is a situation that concerns all of us.”</p>\n<p>AFGJ has maintained a list of U.S. Political Prisoners since 2013, when Stan Smith of the Chicago Committee to Free the [Cuban] Five put that list together for the first time, counting 38 U.S. Political Prisoners. Due to a lack of capacity at the time, we did not undertake an update again until 2018, when we were able to hire Nasim Chatha to help us organize a new comprehensive and updated list. Nasim had been our intern in 2012 and had written some of our pioneering work on the related theme of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/prison-imperialism\">Prison Imperialism</a>. (Prison Imperialism focuses on the export of the US mass incarceration model to other countries.)</p>\n<p>Ours is not the only political prisoner list, and we have always consulted the work of others while augmenting those with our research. We have especially relied heavily on the advice and feedback of Claude Marks from the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freedomarchives.org/\">Freedom Archives</a> and have regularly referenced the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">Jericho Movement</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nukeresister.org/\">Nuclear Resister</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://earthfirstjournal.news/\">Earth First!,</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.abcf.net/\">Anarchist Black Cross</a>.</p>\n<p>How we define who is a “political prisoner” is a classification always open to debate. We note that some organizations, such as the Jericho Movement, do not list people as political prisoners unless they have asked or agreed to be so listed. As we noted in our 2020 report,</p>\n<p>“There is a concern that prisoners may experience further targeting and harassment as a result of attention brought by well-meaning supporters. We very much respect that. For our purpose, we are trying to build a comprehensive list that reflects the overall extent and reality of politically motivated arrests in the United States. We are not involved in direct advocacy. For political prisoners who have specific solidarity campaigns, we have tried to provide links. If there are no advocacy organizations linked, they may not exist or be wanted.”</p>\n<p>We are not attempting to maintain a complete list of all U.S. political prisoners. Instead, our list is of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">U.S. political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire</a> (PP/POEs). There are, for instance, animal rights activists whom we do not include. A person arrested for direct action against the inhumane conditions suffered under the conditions of factory farming, or to liberate animals from pens where there is no freedom of movement, is not included, unless there is some element directly related to the struggle against the underpinnings of Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696,538&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?w=792&ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=768%2C593&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=150%2C116&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696%2C538&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Home | Jericho Movement\" width=\"516\" height=\"399\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/home-or-jericho-movement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=792%2C612&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,612\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"home-or-jericho-movement\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=300%2C232&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=696%2C538&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">thejerichomovement.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Even under socialism, under nations in resistance to Empire, sometimes even under locally autonomous communities, there are animals kept and exploited under conditions that can only be described as cruel. But one cannot simply blame Empire for this, even when and if it exacerbates the problem.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we define political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire? Our August 5, 2020 report on political prisoners states:</p>\n<p>“Our definition of political prisoners refers to people who are incarcerated for alleged crimes related to resistance and liberation from repression. We believe that these cases should not be treated as isolated, ‘common’ crimes, but [cases that] require a political solution. In many cases, those in jail are there because of false allegations or because they were framed and railroaded through the courts. Our list is not only of political prisoners, but also of what we term “prisoners of Empire.” By that, we mean people who are jailed because of activities that constitute a direct challenge to the national and international dominance of U.S., NATO, and transnational capitalist imperialism.”</p>\n<p>We also note in our listing that,</p>\n<p>“…political prisoners […] require a political solution […] Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply ‘common crimes.’ Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute an endorsement of the tactics or immediate goals of every individual. We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so can be, itself, a crime against the people. In many cases, those arrested have been set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights. More often than not, they have received harsher sentences than usual because of the political nature of their activities.”</p>\n<p>Although the origins of our PP/POEs list date back to 2013, this is only the second comprehensive analysis we’ve published. The first analysis was in response to the 2020 uprising sparked by the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd. We admit that what we have could be significantly augmented.</p>\n<p>We need another major and exhaustive review of the definitions, criteria, and categories we employ. Towards that end, we’ve established a committee that will spend the next year revising all aspects of the list. This is an ongoing process, and if you have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to send your suggestions to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"692308040c1a29282f2e2347061b0e47\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p>One must also look at the back stories behind the numbers and trends. For instance, in 2018, we listed 50 political prisoners. After several minor revisions in the interim, in which the total was steady, we published a major update in August of 2020, following the peak of the 2020 uprising. We found that after the 2020 uprising, the number of PPs/POE had risen by 12.28% to 57.</p>\n<p>As of the present moment, the number has diminished to a count of 55 U.S. PP/POEs, as of August 10, 2022. The decline in the overall number can be attributed to paroles, completed sentences, as well as deaths, of several PP/POEs. Especially, over the past two years, several Black PP/POEs arrested in crackdowns during the previous century have died in prison or been released after decades behind bars. These include the MOVE 9 and participants in historic Black liberation struggles, both armed and unarmed.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we found 38.60% of PPs/POE were Black, and just over 72% were people of color. Today, the percentage of Black PP/POEs has dropped to 34.55% (19), while the overall number of people of color who are PPs/POE has dropped to 69% (38). Of the other PP/POEs who are people of color, 10.9% (6) are Latino; 5.45% (3) are North “American” Indigenous; 3.64% (2) are Asian-American (non-Arab, Middle Eastern, or Central Asian); and 16.36% (9) are Arab, Middle Eastern, African Muslim, or Central Asian (one PP/POE is of Pakistani heritage, and one PP/POE is included under both Latino and Arab, ME, etc.-heritage categories).</p>\n<p>As for the last category, we have included these together because we’ve found it difficult to find statistics related to these specific ethnic groups. Instead, we find the closest readily available statistics have to do with Muslims in prison—and Muslim is not an ethnicity and can include people from all over the world, including those who are not necessarily people of color.</p>\n<p>Although Muslim or perceived-as-Muslim peoples are not ethnicities, they are discriminated against as if they were, targeted as a class because of their actual or perceived religious identification. Similarly, prison population statistics regularly confuse the count of Latino prisoners by counting most of them simply as “white.”</p>\n<p>To understand the racism revealed in these percentages, we must compare them to the demographic percentages of the US population as a whole. Respectively, we find that the U.S. general population is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/VET605220#VET605220\">13.6% Black, 18.9% Latino, 1.3% Indigenous</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/\">1.1% “Muslim.”</a></p>\n<p>The racist application of the “criminal justice” system is a feature of the entire system, not just of political imprisonment, which itself reflects a larger reality. For instance, we find that Black persons are incarcerated at a rate <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/jail-inmates-2020-statistical-tables\">3.5 times higher than that of Whites</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696,357&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?w=779&ssl=1 779w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=300%2C154&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=768%2C394&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=150%2C77&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696%2C357&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Progression from slavery to mass incarceration in US history\" width=\"612\" height=\"314\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=779%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"779,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=300%2C154&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=696%2C357&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2019/08/slavery-to-mass-incarceration\">benjerry.com</a></span></p>\n<p>We need to place the differences and the total number of PP/POEs within context. Among the U.S. PP/POEs, it is significant that just over 14.55% (8) of the total are those incarcerated for their activities during the 2020 Uprising. There are also still two PP/POEs that remain in jail for activities related to the Ferguson uprising in 2014, following the extrajudicial killing of Michael Brown. If we add those together, we find that 18.18% of U.S. PPs/POE have been jailed in relation to charges stemming from the birth and continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>How do we determine who and how many are PPs/POE because of anti-racist struggle? We count 22 of 55 PPs/POE, or 40%, arrested for domestic anti-racist actions. As an international solidarity organization, AFGJ is keenly aware that U.S. foreign policies and international relations are extensions of the same policies, attitudes, and actions that drive domestic racism. U.S. wars, sanctions, blockades, and Prison Imperialism are overwhelmingly wielded against nations with a large majority of people of color, countries of the Global South. We find that 11 PPs/POE are in jail for actions of international solidarity with specific nations targeted by Empire (as Noam Chomsky defines it, “an integrated policy of U.S. military and economic supremacy”).</p>\n<p>Another 8 are people involved in activities of self-determination, liberation, and defense of their territories from occupation, war, sanctions, and blockades.</p>\n<p>Among them are Simon Trinidad from Colombia, Ivan Vargas from Colombia, Alex Saab from Venezuela, the Virgin Island Three, Mun Chol, Myong, and Leonard Peltier (in defense of the Lakota nation in occupied South Dakota). Together, these represent 34.55% (19) of those engaged in struggle directly against the international application of U.S. racist and political repression. When we combine those arrested for domestic and international resistance to U.S. racism, we find that 42 of 55 PPs/POE, 76.36%, are incarcerated for acts of anti-racist resistance.</p>\n<p>In other words, more than three quarters of US/POEs are in jail for activities that can be described as anti-racist.</p>\n<p>We also count 5.54% (three) PP/POEs jailed for eco-defense. 7.27% (four) were arrested for activities generally or directly opposed to U.S. militarism and wars. 7.27% (the Cleveland Four) are in prison for generalized resistance to the U.S. political system and global capitalism. 3.64% (two) women are in jail for defending themselves from their abusers or rapists.</p>\n<p>As for the last category, the reality is that there are hundreds if not thousands we might include in that category. We need to pose several questions and investigations to determine who and how many of these there are and who, if not all, could be considered Prisoners of Empire. We ask the reader to be patient with us as we delve into this complex and challenging area of research for next year’s report.</p>\n<p>For now, we include Maddesyn George and Fran Thompson as emblematic cases for which we know there is a much higher total.</p>\n<p>We also note that there is overlap in some of these categories. For instance, Fran Thompson is included as a woman arrested for self-defense and an eco-defender, exacerbating her prosecution and sentencing. There are other cases where people are counted in more than one category.</p>\n<p>At the 2013 Tear Down the Walls conference in Tucson, Arizona, Margaret Prescod of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women’s Strike</a> argued that all those interned under the inherently racist and classist U.S. model of mass incarceration are political prisoners. That may not be our definition, but who can honestly claim she was wrong?</p>\n<p>In our list of classes of political imprisonment, we include those held in immigrant detention centers and those still held in occupied Cuba at the Guantánamo prison. But they are not counted among the 55 PPs/POE that we document.</p>\n<p>We do know this—even if we added the 36 inmates in Guantánamo, the thousands held in immigrant detention centers, the many women jailed for defending themselves against their rapists and abusers, and, therefore, in resistance to the patriarchal underpinnings of the Empire, these inclusions would only underscore what we already know: political imprisonment in the U.S. is a tool of racist as well as other easily identified forms of repression both at home and abroad, and all of these cases require political solutions, not individualized and decontextualized punishment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, systemic change is needed, which is another way of saying revolution.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

It is aimed disproportionately at people of color, as well as others engaged in anti-racist struggle. Whether in the fight against racism at home or against racist foreign policies, wars, occupation and colonialism, the overarching purpose of political imprisonment is to intimidate and try to crush militant forms of anti-racist struggle.</em></p>\n<p>By treating U.S. political prisoners as “common criminals,” the criminal justice system individualizes each case as if they are somehow separate from their social contexts. This ignores root causes and impedes the development of political solutions to the underlying issues for which people have been arrested.</p>\n<p>Readers can discern for themselves what is revealed in the findings presented here, and in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">US Political Prisoner list</a> this article analyzes. The large number of people of color and others involved in the anti-racist struggle arrested for their activities is sadly predictable. Our entire history and existing political and economic institutions are founded and advanced squarely on the foundations of racism.</p>\n<p>The problem is the entire U.S. social, political and economic apparatus. It’s the system that must change. Only when that happens will political prisoners find justice and true liberation in the U.S. We fight for the liberation of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal. But as wonderful as winning freedom for individuals may be, without a political solution, little is accomplished regarding the causes for which these prisoners have sacrificed their freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=432,288&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?w=432&ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"A poster with a group of people\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence\" width=\"524\" height=\"349\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"432,288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-political-prisoners-in-usa\">syracuseculturalworkers.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Not all U.S. political prisoners are in jail for explicitly anti-racist struggles. There are those in prison for opposing the whole fabric of militarism and war, women who have defended their bodies from abuse, striking blows against patriarchy, and eco-defenders.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the racism that permeates U.S. political imprisonment does not diminish the validity of the struggles for which they were arrested. Without exception, racism and anti-racism is a factor in every facet of U.S. popular movements. For instance, all anti-war and anti-imperialist struggle has a fundamentally anti-racist aspect. The one existing imperial power in the world today is the U.S./NATO Empire, an Empire centered among mostly White nations, in service to global capitalism and western geopolitical hegemony. That Empire is the primary global purveyor of the exploitation and dispossession of Black, Indigenous, and other colonized peoples in the nations of the Global South.</p>\n<p>We further recognize that we can and must look to anti-racist struggles, especially Black and Indigenous liberation, for guidance, lessons, and leadership, regardless the area of activity. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/racism-liberation-and-us-political-prisoners\">Alliance for Global Justice analysis published August 5, 2020</a> (which this paper updates), explains that,</p>\n<p>“…We are convinced that African people, including the African diaspora, play a leading role in all revolutionary and transformational struggles. African and Indigenous peoples have been specially targeted for repression and exploitation from the very beginning days of the global spread of capitalism. Today, in the U.S., the movement for the rights and self-determination of Black people has, above all else, shown that it is not a temporary struggle but that it has staying power.</p>\n<p>There is a thread that connects the struggles of the very first enslaved people through the historic Civil Rights Movement to the… Black Lives Matter uprisings today. The struggle for Black liberation in the U.S. is huge, mature yet young: multigenerational, experienced, politically savvy, and enduring. The successes of Black liberation struggles have always, in every instance, opened the way for other struggles. The struggles against slavery and for Black voting rights led directly to the women’s suffrage movement. The Civil Rights Movement was a foundation for an endless list of struggles, including anti-war, anti-poverty, women’s rights, Latin American and Asian liberation movements, disability rights, gay rights, and more. (Indigenous defense of the land and its people is, of course, the oldest movement in resistance to Empire in the Americas.) Thus, we can say that the prominence of African heritage political prisoners in the U.S. is a situation that concerns all of us.”</p>\n<p>AFGJ has maintained a list of U.S. Political Prisoners since 2013, when Stan Smith of the Chicago Committee to Free the [Cuban] Five put that list together for the first time, counting 38 U.S. Political Prisoners. Due to a lack of capacity at the time, we did not undertake an update again until 2018, when we were able to hire Nasim Chatha to help us organize a new comprehensive and updated list. Nasim had been our intern in 2012 and had written some of our pioneering work on the related theme of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/prison-imperialism\">Prison Imperialism</a>. (Prison Imperialism focuses on the export of the US mass incarceration model to other countries.)</p>\n<p>Ours is not the only political prisoner list, and we have always consulted the work of others while augmenting those with our research. We have especially relied heavily on the advice and feedback of Claude Marks from the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freedomarchives.org/\">Freedom Archives</a> and have regularly referenced the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">Jericho Movement</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nukeresister.org/\">Nuclear Resister</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://earthfirstjournal.news/\">Earth First!,</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.abcf.net/\">Anarchist Black Cross</a>.</p>\n<p>How we define who is a “political prisoner” is a classification always open to debate. We note that some organizations, such as the Jericho Movement, do not list people as political prisoners unless they have asked or agreed to be so listed. As we noted in our 2020 report,</p>\n<p>“There is a concern that prisoners may experience further targeting and harassment as a result of attention brought by well-meaning supporters. We very much respect that. For our purpose, we are trying to build a comprehensive list that reflects the overall extent and reality of politically motivated arrests in the United States. We are not involved in direct advocacy. For political prisoners who have specific solidarity campaigns, we have tried to provide links. If there are no advocacy organizations linked, they may not exist or be wanted.”</p>\n<p>We are not attempting to maintain a complete list of all U.S. political prisoners. Instead, our list is of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">U.S. political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire</a> (PP/POEs). There are, for instance, animal rights activists whom we do not include. A person arrested for direct action against the inhumane conditions suffered under the conditions of factory farming, or to liberate animals from pens where there is no freedom of movement, is not included, unless there is some element directly related to the struggle against the underpinnings of Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696,538&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?w=792&ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=768%2C593&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=150%2C116&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696%2C538&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Home | Jericho Movement\" width=\"516\" height=\"399\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/home-or-jericho-movement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=792%2C612&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,612\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"home-or-jericho-movement\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=300%2C232&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=696%2C538&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">thejerichomovement.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Even under socialism, under nations in resistance to Empire, sometimes even under locally autonomous communities, there are animals kept and exploited under conditions that can only be described as cruel. But one cannot simply blame Empire for this, even when and if it exacerbates the problem.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we define political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire? Our August 5, 2020 report on political prisoners states:</p>\n<p>“Our definition of political prisoners refers to people who are incarcerated for alleged crimes related to resistance and liberation from repression. We believe that these cases should not be treated as isolated, ‘common’ crimes, but [cases that] require a political solution. In many cases, those in jail are there because of false allegations or because they were framed and railroaded through the courts. Our list is not only of political prisoners, but also of what we term “prisoners of Empire.” By that, we mean people who are jailed because of activities that constitute a direct challenge to the national and international dominance of U.S., NATO, and transnational capitalist imperialism.”</p>\n<p>We also note in our listing that,</p>\n<p>“…political prisoners […] require a political solution […] Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply ‘common crimes.’ Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute an endorsement of the tactics or immediate goals of every individual. We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so can be, itself, a crime against the people. In many cases, those arrested have been set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights. More often than not, they have received harsher sentences than usual because of the political nature of their activities.”</p>\n<p>Although the origins of our PP/POEs list date back to 2013, this is only the second comprehensive analysis we’ve published. The first analysis was in response to the 2020 uprising sparked by the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd. We admit that what we have could be significantly augmented.</p>\n<p>We need another major and exhaustive review of the definitions, criteria, and categories we employ. Towards that end, we’ve established a committee that will spend the next year revising all aspects of the list. This is an ongoing process, and if you have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to send your suggestions to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"7b311a161e083b3a3d3c315514091c55\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p>One must also look at the back stories behind the numbers and trends. For instance, in 2018, we listed 50 political prisoners. After several minor revisions in the interim, in which the total was steady, we published a major update in August of 2020, following the peak of the 2020 uprising. We found that after the 2020 uprising, the number of PPs/POE had risen by 12.28% to 57.</p>\n<p>As of the present moment, the number has diminished to a count of 55 U.S. PP/POEs, as of August 10, 2022. The decline in the overall number can be attributed to paroles, completed sentences, as well as deaths, of several PP/POEs. Especially, over the past two years, several Black PP/POEs arrested in crackdowns during the previous century have died in prison or been released after decades behind bars. These include the MOVE 9 and participants in historic Black liberation struggles, both armed and unarmed.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we found 38.60% of PPs/POE were Black, and just over 72% were people of color. Today, the percentage of Black PP/POEs has dropped to 34.55% (19), while the overall number of people of color who are PPs/POE has dropped to 69% (38). Of the other PP/POEs who are people of color, 10.9% (6) are Latino; 5.45% (3) are North “American” Indigenous; 3.64% (2) are Asian-American (non-Arab, Middle Eastern, or Central Asian); and 16.36% (9) are Arab, Middle Eastern, African Muslim, or Central Asian (one PP/POE is of Pakistani heritage, and one PP/POE is included under both Latino and Arab, ME, etc.-heritage categories).</p>\n<p>As for the last category, we have included these together because we’ve found it difficult to find statistics related to these specific ethnic groups. Instead, we find the closest readily available statistics have to do with Muslims in prison—and Muslim is not an ethnicity and can include people from all over the world, including those who are not necessarily people of color.</p>\n<p>Although Muslim or perceived-as-Muslim peoples are not ethnicities, they are discriminated against as if they were, targeted as a class because of their actual or perceived religious identification. Similarly, prison population statistics regularly confuse the count of Latino prisoners by counting most of them simply as “white.”</p>\n<p>To understand the racism revealed in these percentages, we must compare them to the demographic percentages of the US population as a whole. Respectively, we find that the U.S. general population is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/VET605220#VET605220\">13.6% Black, 18.9% Latino, 1.3% Indigenous</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/\">1.1% “Muslim.”</a></p>\n<p>The racist application of the “criminal justice” system is a feature of the entire system, not just of political imprisonment, which itself reflects a larger reality. For instance, we find that Black persons are incarcerated at a rate <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/jail-inmates-2020-statistical-tables\">3.5 times higher than that of Whites</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696,357&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?w=779&ssl=1 779w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=300%2C154&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=768%2C394&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=150%2C77&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696%2C357&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Progression from slavery to mass incarceration in US history\" width=\"612\" height=\"314\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=779%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"779,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=300%2C154&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=696%2C357&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2019/08/slavery-to-mass-incarceration\">benjerry.com</a></span></p>\n<p>We need to place the differences and the total number of PP/POEs within context. Among the U.S. PP/POEs, it is significant that just over 14.55% (8) of the total are those incarcerated for their activities during the 2020 Uprising. There are also still two PP/POEs that remain in jail for activities related to the Ferguson uprising in 2014, following the extrajudicial killing of Michael Brown. If we add those together, we find that 18.18% of U.S. PPs/POE have been jailed in relation to charges stemming from the birth and continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>How do we determine who and how many are PPs/POE because of anti-racist struggle? We count 22 of 55 PPs/POE, or 40%, arrested for domestic anti-racist actions. As an international solidarity organization, AFGJ is keenly aware that U.S. foreign policies and international relations are extensions of the same policies, attitudes, and actions that drive domestic racism. U.S. wars, sanctions, blockades, and Prison Imperialism are overwhelmingly wielded against nations with a large majority of people of color, countries of the Global South. We find that 11 PPs/POE are in jail for actions of international solidarity with specific nations targeted by Empire (as Noam Chomsky defines it, “an integrated policy of U.S. military and economic supremacy”).</p>\n<p>Another 8 are people involved in activities of self-determination, liberation, and defense of their territories from occupation, war, sanctions, and blockades.</p>\n<p>Among them are Simon Trinidad from Colombia, Ivan Vargas from Colombia, Alex Saab from Venezuela, the Virgin Island Three, Mun Chol, Myong, and Leonard Peltier (in defense of the Lakota nation in occupied South Dakota). Together, these represent 34.55% (19) of those engaged in struggle directly against the international application of U.S. racist and political repression. When we combine those arrested for domestic and international resistance to U.S. racism, we find that 42 of 55 PPs/POE, 76.36%, are incarcerated for acts of anti-racist resistance.</p>\n<p>In other words, more than three quarters of US/POEs are in jail for activities that can be described as anti-racist.</p>\n<p>We also count 5.54% (three) PP/POEs jailed for eco-defense. 7.27% (four) were arrested for activities generally or directly opposed to U.S. militarism and wars. 7.27% (the Cleveland Four) are in prison for generalized resistance to the U.S. political system and global capitalism. 3.64% (two) women are in jail for defending themselves from their abusers or rapists.</p>\n<p>As for the last category, the reality is that there are hundreds if not thousands we might include in that category. We need to pose several questions and investigations to determine who and how many of these there are and who, if not all, could be considered Prisoners of Empire. We ask the reader to be patient with us as we delve into this complex and challenging area of research for next year’s report.</p>\n<p>For now, we include Maddesyn George and Fran Thompson as emblematic cases for which we know there is a much higher total.</p>\n<p>We also note that there is overlap in some of these categories. For instance, Fran Thompson is included as a woman arrested for self-defense and an eco-defender, exacerbating her prosecution and sentencing. There are other cases where people are counted in more than one category.</p>\n<p>At the 2013 Tear Down the Walls conference in Tucson, Arizona, Margaret Prescod of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women’s Strike</a> argued that all those interned under the inherently racist and classist U.S. model of mass incarceration are political prisoners. That may not be our definition, but who can honestly claim she was wrong?</p>\n<p>In our list of classes of political imprisonment, we include those held in immigrant detention centers and those still held in occupied Cuba at the Guantánamo prison. But they are not counted among the 55 PPs/POE that we document.</p>\n<p>We do know this—even if we added the 36 inmates in Guantánamo, the thousands held in immigrant detention centers, the many women jailed for defending themselves against their rapists and abusers, and, therefore, in resistance to the patriarchal underpinnings of the Empire, these inclusions would only underscore what we already know: political imprisonment in the U.S. is a tool of racist as well as other easily identified forms of repression both at home and abroad, and all of these cases require political solutions, not individualized and decontextualized punishment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, systemic change is needed, which is another way of saying revolution.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Newt Gingrich visited Taiwan as House speaker in 1997, but he also stopped in China as part of his Asia tour, and US-China relations were much better than they are today. Pelosi’s visit also followed a pattern of increasingly frequent congressional delegations to the island.</p>\n<p>China’s military is also much more advanced today than it was in the 1990s. In the weeks leading up to Pelosi’s visit, China made it clear that it would view her trip as a provocation and warned that it would respond strongly. After the visit, China launched its largest-ever military exercises around Taiwan, simulated blockading the island, and fired missiles over Taiwan for the first time.</p>\n<p>Campbell also revealed that the US plans to increase trade relations with Taiwan, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.antiwar.com/2022/06/02/beijing-calls-on-us-to-stop-trade-talks-with-taiwan/\">another thing Beijing has warned against</a>. “We’re developing an ambitious roadmap for trade negotiations, which we intend to announce in the coming days,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campbell is the co-founder of the hawkish Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank and worked in the State Department during the Obama administration, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.antiwar.com/2021/01/13/architect-of-obamas-asia-pivot-to-head-bidens-indo-pacific-policy/\">where he led the policy known as the “pivot” to Asia.</a> Last year, Campbell set the tone for the Biden administration’s China policy by saying<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.antiwar.com/2021/05/26/bidens-top-asia-official-says-us-engagement-with-china-is-over/\"> the era of engagement with Beijing was over</a> and that the two countries’ relationship will now be defined by competition.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

It is now forcing them to reunite.</em></p>\n<p>Israel clearly intended to provoke a wave of missile strikes with the arrest of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-forces-arrest-senior-islamic-jihad-leader-raid-kills-palestinian-youth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bassam al-Saadi</a>, a senior member of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Palestinian</a> Islamic Jihad group (PIJ). For three days, the PIJ did not react. Saadi had been arrested seven times before and even leaked footage of him being dragged by soldiers did not ignite passions. There were no protests in the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Israel then launched its attack on Friday afternoon, killing <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-israel-launches-air-strikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taiseer al-Jabari</a>, the commander of the northern division of al-Quds Brigades (Saraya al-Quds), the military wing of the PIJ, along with five-year-old <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-five-year-old-palestinian-killed-family-mourn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alaa Qaddoum</a>, a 23-year-old woman, and seven other Palestinian men.</p>\n<p>By the standards of this long and bitter conflict, Israel’s attack on Gaza was unprovoked. There is no evidence to support the contention that Jabari was preparing an attack on Israeli tanks.</p>\n<p>Only three hours after the strikes on Gaza did the PIJ unleash a rocket barrage, but Hamas’s much larger rocket force remained in its silos.</p>\n<p>All of the targets of this campaign are local commanders and relative unknowns, even to Ran Kochav, the spokesperson for the Israeli army <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-logic-behind-attack-anyone-guess-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">who forgot Jabari’s name </a>on live television on Saturday.</p>\n<p>But if the campaign to defang the West Bank is clear, it is equally the case that such an operation would provoke the very uprising it is designed to stem. An armed uprising in the West Bank is no longer a matter of if, only when. This is not just a consequence of the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, whose writ no longer runs in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/israel-palestine-jenin-armed-resistance-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jenin</a>, or indeed <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/west-bank-resistance-nablus-mourns-dead-fighters-wave-grows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nablus</a>. Both cities have formed their own brigades.</p>\n<h2><strong>A leadership deficit</strong></h2>\n<p>The formation of new armed cells in territory which has largely eschewed armed resistance since 2007 reflects not only the collapse of the PA, but a leadership deficit within all Palestinian factions, PIJ and Hamas included.</p>\n<p>The cells themselves may be “inspired” by the Islamic Jihad movement but their members come from all groups, including Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Put simply, the West Bank is bristling with guns, most of which can be acquired easily on the Israeli market. A new generation of Palestinians is trading in their cars, careers and, ultimately, their own lives for them.</p>\n<p>This decision has little to do with the weight of history. It has more to do with the burden of the present.</p>\n<p>[embedded content]</p>\n<p>If recognising Israel does not work; if Israel is disinterested in talks that lead to a Palestinian state; if every time Israeli forces attack, the outside <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-attack-world-reactions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">world commends</a> it for doing so; if vigilante gangs of settlers destroy your olive trees and your houses under the armed protection of Israeli soldiers; if the law that applies to those gangs is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2019/01/chapter-3-israeli-settlements-and-international-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">civilian</a>, but the law applying to you, who are unarmed, is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/12/17/born-without-civil-rights/israels-use-draconian-military-orders-repress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">military</a>; if your own leaders are corrupt, and refuse to hold elections for decades for fear of the popular vote: what else is there left for you to do? Surrender? Leave for London?</p>\n<p>Israel is under a profound delusion if it thinks that Palestinians will just melt away. This is the last thing on this generation’s mind. They will stand and fight. It’s not flight they are thinking of, but liberation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Global abandonment</strong></h2>\n<p>Palestinians are as globally connected as any other generation of youths around the world. What exactly is the message world leaders are giving them in their fact-free reactions to the latest bombardments?</p>\n<p>US <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/07/statement-by-president-biden-on-the-ceasefire-in-gaza/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reacted</a> as follows:</p>\n<p>“My support for Israel’s security is long-standing and unwavering – including its right to defend itself against attacks.</p>\n<p>“Over these recent days, Israel has defended its people from indiscriminate rocket attacks launched by the terrorist group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the United States is proud of our support for Israel’s Iron-Dome, which intercepted hundreds of rockets and saved countless lives. I commend Prime Minister Yair Lapid and his government’s steady leadership throughout the crisis.”</p>\n<p>The statement, which is worth reading in full, had no expression of concern about Israel shooting first. Lapid’s actions were commendable.</p>\n<p>Or what about Britain’s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/pm-hopeful-liz-truss-stands-israel-over-gaza-assault\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prime minister to be</a>, <strong>Liz Truss</strong>? As these events were unfolding, Truss addressed <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/pm-hopeful-liz-truss-stands-israel-over-gaza-assault\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conservative Friends of Israel</a> with these words:</p>\n<p>“The UK stands by Israel and its right to defend itself.” In her letter to the group, she added: “We condemn terrorist groups firing at civilians and violence which has resulted in casualties on both sides.”</p>\n<p>To rub salt into the wound, Truss promised to review the location of Britain’s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.jpost.com/international/article-714112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">embassy</a>, which is currently in Tel Aviv – an act which would consign what small role the UK had as a peacemaker or mediator in this conflict to the ashes. There is no domestic pressure for her to do this.</p>\n<p>The EU <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/gaza-statement-spokesperson-latest-developments_en?s=200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acknowledged</a> that the escalation had already led to “a number of casualties” but did not say who they were and which side caused them. France <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/news/2022/article/situation-in-gaza-and-israel-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“deplored”</a> the Palestinian civilian casualties, but condemned “the firing of rockets into Israeli territory and reiterates its unconditional commitment to the security of Israel”.</p>\n<p>Only the UN and the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney broke ranks – by inches, not feet. Ireland said it was “deeply concerned” by the impact of Israeli strikes on civilians.</p>\n<p>What message do these statements send to the families of the 45 Palestinians who have been killed in these attacks, 16 of them children? What message goes through to the hundreds injured?</p>\n<p>In this case, Israel clearly fired first not because a Palestinian militant group had reacted. But because it did not react. That is something of a first in this conflict.</p>\n<p>And it is applauded for doing so by the very same leaders who are <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ukraine-russia-funding-weapons-budget-military-aid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">arming Ukrainian</a> resistance fighters against Russian occupiers.</p>\n<h2><strong>A dangerous message</strong></h2>\n<p>There can be no clearer demonstration of the hollowness of western values than in their persistent, cynical and criminally responsible failure to bring Israel to book for its actions.</p>\n<p>This is a dangerous message to be sending both sides in the conflict, not least Israel itself.</p>\n<p>Lapid is unlikely to lead public opinion in Israel. Israel’s next generation of soldiers are not following him, rather the likes of the Kahanist<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-ben-gvir-itamar-jewish-supremacist-exploiting-attacks-fan-hate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, who took part in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-storm-al-aqsa-mosque-gaza-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storming</a> of the Al-Aqsa Mosque along with his supporters.</p>\n<p>If Benjamin Netanyahu succeeds in forming the next government later this year, the extreme right – and from a group once classed by the US and Israel as terrorists – could well be in his cabinet.</p>\n<p>By giving Lapid the greenest of green lights to kill Palestinians at will, western leaders are sending an even more dangerous message to the next generation of Israeli leaders who are openly talking of killing Arabs come what may. They openly threaten Palestinians with another Nakba.</p>\n<p>The latest target of Israel’s operation in the West Bank is described as Israel’s most wanted man in Nablus. But <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2022/08/israel-kills-3-resistance-fighters-in-nablus-one-teen-in-hebron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ibrahim al-Nabulsi was only 19 years old</a>. Before the final firefight of his life, Nabulsi made an audio recording that went <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tamermisshal/status/1556892014217658375?s=12&t=tEWyC2SbGAKlsP3-DGILsA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">viral</a>: “Preserve the homeland after me, and my commandment is for no one to leave gunpowder. I am besieged, and I am going to be martyred,” he said.</p>\n<p>Huge crowds attended his funeral, and those of Islam Sabbouh and 16-year-old Hussein Taha, who died in the same Israeli raid.</p>\n<p>The relief for Israel in his death will be strictly temporary. The obvious fact is that the more Palestinians Israel kills the more they provide a recruiting platform for fighters to replace them.</p>\n<p>Elaine Abu-Shaweesh is all of five or six years old. She was injured in bombings in Rafah on Saturday. Hani Alshaer, a journalist from Gaza, caught her on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cg76YW1phNV/?igshid=NmZiMzY2Mjc=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> with a bloody bandage on her head, and saying: “Israel is not a state, and they are under, under, under my feet. And they are on the ground and are trash and they are not. They are bombing kids and maybe right now they have destroyed our house, because last time they did, last war.”</p>\n<p>No one taught this little girl what to say. But come what may she will grow up to resist what is happening all around her. This is Israel’s work. It is also the world’s responsibility.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

The economists write that the reserves are crucial for Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), as the central bank is called, to function. And, without an operational central bank, the Afghan economy is not able to work properly, with many unable to receive salaries and the government unable to perform basic monetary duties and limited in paying for imports.</em></p>\n<p>“As economists — and, among us, former central bankers — we are deeply concerned by the compounding economic and humanitarian catastrophes unfolding in Afghanistan, and, in particular, by the role of US policy in driving them,” the letter states. “We write today to urge you to take immediate action to confront this crisis, above all by allowing the central bank of Afghanistan, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) to reclaim its international reserves.”</p>\n<p>Signers to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://epsusa.org/s/2022-08-10-Economists-Letter-Afghanistan.pdf\">the letter</a> include the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, Jayati Ghosh, Linda Bilmes; Sir Richard Jolly of the University of Sussex; Dean Baker, Eileen Appelbaum, and Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research; and Heidi Shierholtz, Jeff Faux, John Schmitt, and Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute, among many others.</p>\n<p>Andrés Arauz, formerly general director for the central bank in Ecuador, also signed the letter. Arauz recently<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/afghanistan-hunger-crisis-foreign-reserves-central-bank-us-biden/\"> wrote</a> from his experience as a central banker to explain why the reserves are vital to the Afghan central bank’s functioning.</p>\n<p>“Without access to its foreign reserves, the central bank of Afghanistan cannot carry out its normal, essential functions,” the letter states. “Without a functioning central bank, the economy of Afghanistan has, predictably, collapsed. The people of Afghanistan have been made to suffer doubly for a government they did not choose. In order to mitigate the humanitarian crisis and set the Afghan economy on a path toward recovery, we urge you to allow DAB to reclaim its international reserves.”</p>\n<p>Previously, the<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-01-26/secretary-generals-remarks-the-security-council-afghanistan-delivered\"> UN Secretary-General</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/04/afghanistan-un-experts-call-us-government-unblock-foreign-assets-central\"> leading UN human rights experts</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/586618-dozens-of-democrats-call-on-biden/\"> US lawmakers</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/06/06/afghanistan-funds-famine-crisis-911-families/\"> families of the victims of the September 11 attacks</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AfgWomAdvGrp/status/1492981028700442630?s=20&t=Nm5H-yhV_aZTuAaMja1RQw\"> Afghan women’s</a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WILPFAFGGROUP/photos/a.160593204623141/936638563685264/?type=3&theater\"> groups</a> and<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/05/famine-afghanistan-joe-biden-reparations\"> feminist leaders</a>, leading<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cepr.net/press-release/human-rights-watch-humanitarian-groups-at-senate-call-for-change-in-us-policy-in-afghanistan/\"> human rights organizations</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.afsc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Afghanistan%20Asset%20Freeze%20CSO%20Letter%20.pdf\"> civil society organizations</a>, and others have called for the release of the Afghanistan Central Bank’s assets.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Seeing how the Foundation promotes synthetic foods as an equitable answer, the end results on public health are bound to be the same</span></em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>In a recent interview with Roman Balmakov from “Facts Matter,”<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref1\">1</span></sup> a podcast by The Epoch Times, I discuss how American medicine was reshaped and holistic medicine sidelined by the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, starting in 1910. Before that time, natural medicine — using herbs, homeopathic remedies and general nutrition from food were very popular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/public/2022/August/trends-and-disparities-in-cardiometabolic-health.jpg\" alt=\"trends and disparities in cardiometabolic health\" width=\"592\" height=\"325\" data-mlazyload-src=\"https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/public/2022/August/trends-and-disparities-in-cardiometabolic-health.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>I believe it’s fairly easy to see that the transition from holistic medicine, which treats the cause, to synthetic drugs that only treat symptoms, has been a driving factor behind the rise in metabolic diseases. But before I get into the history I want to share an incredible study published last month that shows 14 out 15 people in the United States are metabolically unfit. This shocking analysis was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</p>\n<p>I am currently writing a new book, and the first chapter details how Rockefeller captured the U.S. medical system through a clever campaign that had his foundation strategically invest $150 million from 1920 to 1930 in medical schools and hospitals. While this may not sound like much today, adjusting for inflation that is between $4 and 5 billion dollars today.</p>\n<p>This investment secured his ability to control the entire medical school curriculum. After 1910 all natural medical therapies were eliminated and replaced with teaching about drugs. Many may not realize that most drugs are derived from petrochemicals<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref2\">2</span></sup> and oil was what Rockefeller was known for.</p>\n<p>Understanding how medicine was corrupted in the first place can help us understand current-day events as well. In many ways, it’s a repeat of the basic process — identify a problem or shortcoming (whether true or fabricated), pronounce a solution, then tear down the old system and replace it with a new one.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Intentional Suppression of Health</strong></h2>\n<p>Statistics reveal 14 out of 15 American adults are metabolically unhealthy, which is a staggering realization. As I explain in the interview, I’ve spent the last 25 years educating people about the foundations of good health, and warning against that which undermine it, which includes environmental, dietary and pharmaceutical toxins.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been disparaged as a “top misinformation spreader” about COVID, the attacks against me started long before the pandemic, so this is nothing new for me. The fact of the matter is that holistic health and nutrition have been the top threats to allopathic medicine ever since its inception, 112 years ago.</p>\n<p>They’ve been suppressing knowledge about nutrition and natural health ever since they successfully banished these concepts from the medical schools. What’s new is that we now have technologies that greatly facilitate the suppression and censorship of information on the one hand, and allow Big Pharma to blanket the information space with its propaganda on the other.</p>\n<p>The end result is an echo chamber with no diversity of opinion. This is dangerous in any circumstance, but in particular when it comes to health. These technological advancements have also facilitated what professor Matthias Desmet refers to as “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/the-psychology-of-totalitarianism#details\">mass formation hypnosis</a>,” a psychological condition required for totalitarianism to truly take hold.</p>\n<p>Google is a major player in this social engineering project; 93% of online searches in the entire world are done using Google. But this doesn’t include the dozens of other search engines that use Google’s application programming interface (API) to access the results, which means that number is likely north of 95 to 96%. Indeed, a 2022 report showed that 94% of all mobile and tablet searches are using Google.<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref3\">3</span></sup></p>\n<p>That number is beyond shocking. Virtually anyone using the internet is relying on Google’s search engine. Please understand that all the information on censored sites still exist but if you don’t have an index or key to locate it, it is the same as if it never existed. Google has very cleverly silently implemented the 21st century version of the burning of the Library of Alexandria.</p>\n<p>Until 2016, it was relatively easy to find information online. Very little was censored. But, over time, and especially over the past six years or so, Google started tweaking algorithms to suppress certain kinds of information that are in competition with Big Pharma, Big Food and other globalist interests.</p>\n<p>Today, that information restriction has reached a zenith. It can be very difficult to get to certain kinds of information, and sometimes you have to bypass labels warning you that you’re about to read something that has been “debunked” and could harm you if followed, and redirectional messages telling you where to go and what to read instead.</p>\n<h2><strong>How the Medical System Was Hijacked</strong></h2>\n<p>As mentioned, Standard Oil mogul John D. Rockefeller was instrumental in corrupting the medical system, turning it from a focus on health to a focus on treating symptoms with petrochemical-derived pharmaceuticals, thereby ensuring that people remain sick — sometimes for life.</p>\n<p>John’s father was William Avery Rockefeller, an authentic “snake oil salesman” who impersonated physicians and conned people into buying his useless “Rock Oil” tonic for cancer — a mixture of laxative and petroleum. Avery once admitted he would cheat his children every chance he got, in order to “make ‘em sharp.”<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref4\">4</span></sup> Evidently, John D. learned the lessons of duplicity and fraud well.</p>\n<p>In 1901 — after dismantling the public transportation system in the U.S. and taking over the public education system — Rockefeller set his sights on the medical industry. He founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and appointed Dr. Simon Flexner, a professor of experimental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania, to head it up.</p>\n<p>Flexner’s brother, Abraham, was commissioned by Rockefeller and Henry Pritchett, then-president of the Carnegie Foundation,<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref5\">5</span></sup> to write a report on the state of the American medical education system. One of the goals of this study, which became known as The Flexner Report,<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref6\">6</span></sup> was to improve the credibility of the medical profession.</p>\n<p>The now infamous term “trust the science” that Fauci and others famously promoted has its roots in this report, which was published in 1910, as it sought to impress the importance of scientific medicine. It’s really impossible to overstate the impact the Flexner report had on medicine, as it led to a complete and radical overhaul.</p>\n<p>Virtually every natural medical therapy was criminalized and about half of all medical schools were forced to shut down. Natural medicine practitioners were put out of business and replaced with doctors who practiced scientific medicine. Natural remedies and ancient effective cures were dismissed as quackery.</p>\n<p>The only medicines deemed reputable were patentable synthetic drugs, invented in the oil cartel’s own research centers. The new system also put into place barriers for Blacks and women, making it very difficult for them to get into medical school. Similar changes took place in hospitals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Rockefeller Yesterday and Today</strong></h2>\n<p>Through the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Flexner report, extravagant donations to strategic partners and investments in the pharmaceutical industry, Rockefeller gained unprecedented control over the entire medical system, from education and science to hospitals and the drug companies themselves.</p>\n<p>John D. died in 1937 (actually about a mile from where I currently live), but his legacy lives on. To this day, the Rockefeller family owns about 50% of all drug companies, and The Rockefeller Foundation has played a central role in the global cabal’s effort to impose worldwide totalitarianism.</p>\n<aside>The Rockefeller Foundation is now leading the charge toward a new food system centered around synthetic and lab grown foods, which will have the same effects on health as the late John D. Rockefeller’s ‘new and improved’ allopathic medical system.</aside>\n<p>For example, the Rockefeller Foundation was part of Event 201,<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref7\">7</span></sup> in which the authoritarian response to COVID was laid out, and in July 2020, it published “Reset the Table: Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food System,”<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref8\">8</span></sup> which calls for a restructuring of the entire food system to make it more “fair and equitable.”</p>\n<p>According to the Foundation, the pandemic revealed deep problems in the U.S. food system that need to be “reset,” much in the same way that the Flexner report found problems in the medical system that needed to be fixed by changing it from the ground up.</p>\n<p>So, the Rockefeller Foundation is now leading the charge toward a new food system centered around synthetic and lab-grown foods, which will have the same effects on health as the late John D.’s “new and improved” allopathic medical system.</p>\n<h2><strong>They’ve Declared Their Plan for a Food Crisis</strong></h2>\n<p>As I mention in the interview, the globalist cabal, which includes The Rockefeller Foundation, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and many other entities and individuals, are not necessarily shy about telling us their plans.</p>\n<p>It’s detailed in publicly available reports, in interviews, mainstream media articles and during the annual meeting in Davos. So, if you’re observant, and believe what they’re actually saying, you can know what’s coming. Right now, we’re repeatedly told that the food system is not working, climate change is destroying food production and that to survive, we need to get used to eating insects and drinking reclaimed sewage.</p>\n<p>Gates is calling on the Western world to abandon real meat and transition to lab-grown meat which he, of course, is invested in. The Netherlands and Canada are now imposing nitrogen restrictions that will result in farmers being put out of business, and food distribution centers are mysteriously burning down around the world.</p>\n<p>All the signs for a manufactured food crisis are here. I was a Boy Scout as a youth, and their motto, “Be Prepared,” has served me well. And, certainly, if there ever was a time to get prepared, it’s now.</p>\n<p>They’re dismantling the food system in order to replace it with patented foods, in the same way Rockefeller replaced natural herbs and nutrition with patentable synthetic chemicals a century ago. So, if you can, you’d be wise to stock up on food to last three to six months, or more.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Global Genocide?</strong></h2>\n<p>On top of the intentional destruction of our food supply to justify the “build back better” agenda, which is basically code for the implementation of worldwide tyranny, we’re also facing a worldwide agenda that appears intent on taking as many lives as possible in coming years.</p>\n<p>And that includes children. In late June 2022, the United States became the first country in the world to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID jabs for toddlers as young as 6 months. The Food and Drug Administration issued the EUA June 17,<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref9\">9</span></sup> and the very next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended all toddlers get the shot as soon as possible.<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref10\">10</span></sup></p>\n<p>The sad reality is that our regulatory authorities are an absolute sham. They want you to believe there are agencies looking out for your best interest, but they’re actually fronts for the drug industry. Shockingly, they’re not even above sacrificing children in their efforts to generate maximum profits for their masters pulling the strings.</p>\n<p>As I’ve described in other articles, the apparent reason for why they’re doing this is because the COVID jab makers want the jab to be put on the childhood vaccination schedule. When that happens, they’ll have permanent immunity against lawsuits for any injuries and deaths that happen and will not have to rely on the EUA any longer.</p>\n<p>This is the same kind of liability shield they have under EUA, but to breach the gap from EUA liability shield to permanent liability shield, they need to get it onto the childhood vaccination schedule. The EUA for young children and toddlers was a necessary step toward that. Time will tell how many children end up injured or killed by this decision.</p>\n<p>If the adverse event profile is anything like that of adults, we’ll be looking at tens of thousands of dead children within a year or two. Fortunately, so far, only 2% of young children in the U.S. have received the jab. So, even many parents who gladly got the shot themselves now realize that there’s something wrong here.</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA and CDC Are Corrupt Beyond Repair</strong></h2>\n<p>In my view, giving the COVID jab to children is the most egregious and outrageous decision ever reached in American medicine. It’s just beyond shocking. But it’s not surprising.</p>\n<p>In fact, it was anticipated, for the simple fact that these agencies have been thoroughly corrupted and had, all throughout the COVID pandemic, demonstrated that that corruption. Bioethics are nonexistent. Human morals are out the window.</p>\n<p>All that matters, it seems, is the reign of Big Pharma’s latest innovation, this gene transfer technology, which the transhumanist cabal intends to play with over time to usher in their nonhuman utopia. They want humans merged with machines.</p>\n<p>They want our brains hooked up to the cloud so our thoughts can be monitored and, undoubtedly, “corrected” from an external source. The Great Reset is not only a reset of our financial system and our food system; it’s the reinvention of the human species.</p>\n<h2><strong>Evidence of Fraud</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, as I mention in the interview, one of the things that gives me hope is that we’re now seeing clear evidence of fraud, which is the only thing that might break the iron clad liability shield these companies have been given.</p>\n<p>In September 2021, a group called Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FDA to obtain the documentation used to approve Comirnaty, including safety and effectiveness data, adverse reaction reports and lists of active and inactive ingredients.</p>\n<p>When, after a month, the FDA still had not responded to the FOIA request, the PHMPT sued.<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref11\">11</span></sup> The FDA and Pfizer asked the court to grant them, first for 55 years and then 75 years, to release it all, but they were overruled. As a result, we’re getting around 55,000 pages or so per month. You can find them all on PHMPT.org.<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref12\">12</span></sup></p>\n<p>A tranche of Pfizer documents released in March 2022 included a whopping nine pages of recorded side effects — 158,000 in all! They knew the jab caused heart problems, myocarditis, stroke, blood clots, neurological problems — you name it, it’s there. Yet they didn’t tell the public, and neither did the FDA.</p>\n<h2><strong>Murder for Profit</strong></h2>\n<p>This is in some ways similar to the case of Vioxx. Merck knew the drug was causing lethal heart problems but suppressed the information for years — for financial reasons. Vioxx was a blockbuster drug, pulling in $2.5 billion a year.<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref13\">13</span></sup> By the time the FDA took the drug off the market, it had already killed at least 60,000.</p>\n<p>The COVID jabs, meanwhile, are the biggest blockbusters in medical history. In 2021, Pfizer made $36.7 billion from its shot, Moderna made $17.7 billion. Combined, they project $51 billion in sales for 2022.<sup><span data-hash=\"#ednref14\">14</span></sup></p>\n<p>Merck was willing to sacrifice 60,000 lives for an annual profit of $2.5 billion, which is downright paltry in comparison to the COVID jabs. Is it any surprise then that the accepted number of injuries and deaths from the COVID jabs appear to be unlimited? In short, these self-serving, profit-at-any-cost decisions are nothing new. It’s just on a scale we’ve never seen before.</p>\n<p>Pfizer far exceeds Merck’s crimes and profits as they forecast $32 billion in revenue for their COVID jab in this year alone and another $22 billion for oral COVID 19 treatment Paxlovid. And, this year, the company expects to rake in more than $50 billion in global revenue from just those two medications to treat COVID 19. But, get this, their total revenue for 2022 will likely be over $100 billion!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our justice system is nearly as perverted as our regulatory system, but if we were somehow to get an impartial court, and Pfizer were to be convicted of fraud, they would lose all their liability protection and could be held financially liable for every injury and death from their COVID jab, the damages for which would probably run in the trillions of dollars.</p>\n<h2><strong>Join the Great Rejection</strong></h2>\n<p>In the meantime, I believe we’re in for hard times. Government will likely continue pushing for more mRNA jabs, the WHO will continue its power grab to control health decisions worldwide, food shortages will likely become reality, the censoring of truth will continue and people we know and love who took the jabs may suffer and die.</p>\n<p>It could continue getting worse for two or three years, maybe longer. So, prepare for all of it, mentally, emotionally, physically and materially. As intent as the global cabal is on a Great Reset, we need to be just as intent on a Great Rejection of their plans.</p>\n<p>Many systems do need to be dismantled and rebuilt, especially our regulatory, financial, educational and medical systems, but they need to be rebuilt by us, the citizens of each nation, not the technocratic, transhumanist billionaires who believe the right to rule is theirs alone.</p>\n<p>As for our so-called health agencies, they’ve demolished every ounce of trust there ever was, and I suspect the only way the American people will ever accept advice from them again is if there’s a complete reboot. Not a single administrator or adviser from the old guard can be left. Not a single process can be left unrevised. Missions need to be revamped and oaths to protect public health need to be written and sworn.</p>\n<p>All of this will take time and effort, but it can be done. So, I encourage you to search your heart to determine what role you may be able and willing to play once the antihuman globalists are knocked off their pedestal and the true rebuilding begins.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

These include the threat of NATO embracing Ukraine and of the military alliance moving closer to the Russian border: [2]</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We have run out of patience…The West has been driven by hubris and has exacerbated tensions in violation of its obligations and common sense.” [3]</p></blockquote>\n<p>Additionally,<strong> Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei</strong> <strong>Ryabkov</strong> had pointed out that he could “neither confirm nor exclude” the prospect of dispatching military assets to Venezuela and Cuba if the U.S. and its allies did not refrain from further building its own fortifications ever closer to the Russian border![4]</p>\n<p>From the stand-point of the U.S. and its allies, this incident is largely instigated by Russian soldiers massing tens of thousands of troops at the border with Ukraine – an ominous sign that after <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-russian-president-putin-took-crimea-from-ukraine\">“annexing” Ukraine after the political changeover in 2014</a>, the plan was an illegal invasion of the country. A U.S. Bill, backed by Senate Democrats and the White House would impose sweeping sanctions on the Russian Government, military officials, key banking institutions and President Putin himself if the State engaged in hostilities toward Ukraine.[5]</p>\n<p>Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> said in reply that such a move would be “ comparable to a break in relations,” and that ties between the U.S. and Russia would completely unravel. [6]</p>\n<p>It was definitely Russia that declared that the Ukraine joining NATO would be a “red line” that would provoke severe consequences if crossed. After three decades of the hostile alliance sneaking closer and closer to the Great Bear, these words seem to be real, the likes of which we haven’t heard throughout the entire end of the Soviet Union. If the U.S. sticks to its rhetoric as well, are we then looking at a third world war? Possibly leading to nuclear annihilation!</p>\n<p>The threat at stake, possibly even on a par with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 seems very evident, although the consequences haven’t quite dawned on much of the West.

It took control of the remnants of the now decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant and has taken over the largest nuclear plant Zaporizhzhia supplying a fifth of the nation’s power needs. [2]</p>\n<p>The UN Refugee Agency reports that the operation generated one million refugees in seven days. UN High Commissioner for Refugees <strong>Filippo Grandi</strong> said that in almost forty years working on refugee emergencies, “rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.” [3]</p>\n<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> referred to Putin in his State of the Union Speech as “a Russian dictator, invading a foreign country.” He is “enforcing powerful economic sanctions” on the state and promises that “when the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.” [4]</p>\n<p>While the Russian invasion is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://indepthnews.net/index.php/opinion/5061-as-threats-of-war-loom-over-ukraine-the-illegality-of-nato-is-laid-bare\">arguably illegal</a>, the popular messaging about the war both in the corridors of power and in major media reports has been far too simplistic. Are we the ‘allies’ of Ukraine truly reacting to a move by Russia that Biden referred to as “unprovoked?” Was the messaging about Nazis in Ukraine and the tyranny of the Ukrainian government against the people of the Donbass just made up in order to brainwash his own citizens into going along with the crusade of war?</p>\n<p>It is said repeatedly that “in times of war, truth is the first casualty.” With the high stakes in this drama, the Global Research News Hour will attempt to find the context to the facts of the invasion of Ukraine that we have been allowed to verify, and put forward proposals that could relieve Ukraine of an escalating slaughter.</p>\n<p>In our first half hour,<strong> Dr Leon Tressell</strong> a writer and analyst based in the United Kingdom talks at length about the reality of the repression of people in the Eastern-most region of Ukraine by the Ukrainian government and the demonstrable reality of Nazis serve to provide more background of the motives of President Putin’s planning. In our second half hour, peace activist <strong>Bruce Gagnon</strong> talks about long-standing plans by the U.S. to “overextend” and “unbalance” Russia, justifying to some extent Russian feelings of being cornered. Finally, <strong>Tamara Lorincz</strong> as a member of the Voice of Women for Peace focused on the need for Canada to back out of NATO and promote certain moves to de-escalate the situation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dr Leon Tressell</strong> is a historian of geopolitics and writes for Southfront.org</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Bruce Gagnon</strong> is a long time peace activist and coordinates the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.space4peace.org/\">Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in Space</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>T</strong><strong>amara Lorincz</strong> is a member of Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, a PhD candidate, Balsillie School of International Affairs, Wilfrid Laurier University, and a fellow with the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute.</em></p>\n<p>For more information on the March 6 list of events promoting a <strong>World-wide Global Day of Action for </strong><strong> Peace in Ukraine </strong>check out the site <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://worldbeyondwar.org/events/\">https://worldbeyondwar.org/events/</a></p>\n<p><strong>(Global Research News Hour Episode 346)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LISTEN TO THE SHOW</strong><br></p>\n<p><strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://radio4all.net/responder.php/download/111829/123106/134571/?url=http://www.radio4all.net/files/scottprice666@hotmail.com/4319-1-GRNH_346_Mar_4.mp3\">Click to download the audio (MP3 format)</a></strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span><em>The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/theme/global-research-news-hour\">Global Research News Hour</a> airs every Friday at 1pm CT on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ckuw.ca/\">CKUW 95.9FM</a> out of the University of Winnipeg.

The couple have six children, including two adults.</p><p>Kasadah was attacked at about 11:45 a.m. at Nakabondo village, near Bukadde village, while fleeing for safety to Nawaningi village, Iganga District, she said.</p></blockquote><p>This man and his family converted to Christianity and he was attacked for it by Islamic radicals.</p><p>The attack was in line with Quran 5:33, which spells out the punishment for those who cause \"mischief\" against the Islamic god, a verse often applied to apostates (those that leave the faith).</p><blockquote readability=\"13\"><p>Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land.

The only thing worse than renouncing Islam is to blaspheme against the Islamic god or Mohammed, which warrants the death penalty. Islamic attacks such as the one carried out on French newspaper Charlie Hebdo in 2015 show the lengths to which Islamists will go to carry out this sentence.</p><p>The attackers also threatened the church that Kadash had started to attend as a way to send a message.</p><blockquote readability=\"12\"><p>After Kasadah and his family had attended church services for three weeks and missed mosque Friday prayers, sources said, their pastor received a message from one of Kasadah\'s brothers that read, \"It has come to our attention that Musa Kasadah and the family are attending your church. This should stop immediately, otherwise your church is at risk.\"</p></blockquote><p>The religion of peace!</p><blockquote readability=\"30\"><p>The pastor, whose name is with withheld for security reasons, arranged for the Kasadah family to be housed with a local Maumo official, she said. Area Muslims discovered their location after two weeks, and one of them showed up there ostensibly to obtain work on a sugarcane plantation as the family was preparing to leave on July 26, sources said.</p><p>In the course of talking with the homeowner, the Muslim learned that the Kasadah family was on their way to Iganga District, Naigaga said. The family had gone about 15 kilometers (nine miles) when four Muslim extremists in the middle of a road between sugarcane plantations stopped them, she said.</p><p>\"They began questioning my husband, saying, ‘You thought that we shall not get hold of you? We have been tracking you from the house of [the local official, unidentified for security reasons] to here, and today is your last day to be alive. Allah has given you into our hands,\'\" Naigaga said. \"They started beating my husband and then got hold of me and tied me up. <strong>They forced me to sing Christian songs as they began chopping off my husband\'s hand.\"</strong></p></blockquote><p>Yes, Kadash\'s wife was tied up and forced to sing while her husband\'s hand was chopped off.</p><p>In 2022.</p><p>This isn\'t even in an Islamic-majority country.</p><blockquote readability=\"9\"><p>Uganda\'s constitution and other laws provide for religious freedom, including the right to propagate one\'s faith and convert from one faith to another.
