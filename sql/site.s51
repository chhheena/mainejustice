allegation and investigation took part in last week&#8217;s unprecedented raid of his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>\n<p>&#8220;DEVELOPING: Sources say the FBI agents and officials who were involved in the raid on former President Trump’s home work in the same CounterIntelligence Division of the FBI that investigated Trump in the Russiagate hoax and are actively under criminal investigation by Special Counsel John Durham for potentially abusing their power investigating Trump in the Russian fraud and therefore have a potential conflict of interest and should have been RECUSED from participating in this supposed &#8216;espionage&#8217; investigation at Mar-a-Lago,&#8221; <a href=\"https://gettr.com/post/p1mdvss3354\">Sperry wrote in his post</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gettr.com/post/p1mgg74414b\">He then posted</a>: &#8220;BREAKING: Court records reveal that one of the FBI agents who signed the Mar-a-Lago search warrant also has been assigned to &#8216;the investigation of criminal activity in and around the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2001.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sperry, who was WorldNetDaily&#8217;s first investigative reporter and who uncovered one scandal after another during then-President Bill Clinton&#8217;s administration, <a href=\"https://gettr.com/post/p1mdt6365bc\">went on to mock</a> the Justice Department&#8217;s stated reason for the Trump raid: Alleged violations of the Espionage Act:</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Democrats are suddenly concerned about the security of nuclear secrets? Really? Recall how Dems and MSM didn&#8217;t give a rip about &#8220;national security&#8221; when President Clinton: &#8212; declassified tens of thousands of pages of secrets about our nuclear weapons program; &#8212; transferred dual-use missile and other technology to China; and, &#8212; kicked open the doors to Los Alamos and our other nuclear weapons labs to Chinese scientists. Beijing subsequently stole the designs to every nuclear warhead in the US arsenal, including MIRVs, according to the Cox Report, and now China can independently target Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Francisco with a single ICBM.</em></p>\n<p>As for The Mar-a-Lago raid, Sperry said it smacked of the deep state&#8217;s ongoing effort to &#8216;get&#8217; Trump.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is Russiagate 2.0. They were busted trying to frame Trump as a traitor previously, and now they&#8217;re launching a new witch hunt in a desperate attempt to suspend disbelief about their guilt in the last witch hunt. This new frame-up also serves as a way to dirty him up heading into 2024, seeing how their Jan. 6 pre-impeachment effort has failed,&#8221; <a href=\"https://gettr.com/post/p1mlbfp7470\">he wrote in a separate GETTR post</a>.</p>\n<p>Others are not only outraged by the raid but also concerned about it because they see the country heading in an authoritarian direction under the current regime.</p>\n<p>That includes former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who filled in for Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday evening and discussed the raid that was essentially ordered <a href=\"http://www.deepstate.news\">by “the uni-party” in D.C.</a></p>\n<p>“Now, whatever your views are on Donald Trump, there is no denying that the unprecedented raid on his Palm Beach home earlier this week has set our country on a dangerous new course, and there’s no turning back.

And all available evidence <a href=\"https://expose-news.com/2022/08/07/pfizer-docs-official-data-covid-vaccines-causing-depopulation/\" target=\"_blank\">points to</a> Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) &#8220;vaccines&#8221; as the culprit.</p>\n<p>Excess deaths, as they call them, continue to spike in nearly every industrialized country that pushed the shots on', 'their populations. It is happening in the United Kingdom, Nordic Europe and North America – all places where Operation Warp Speed mass vaccination took place.</p>\n<p>The numbers get a little hairy depending on which datasets you use as governments have been working overtime trying to conceal the truth. A deeper probe of the data, however, and it starts to show.</p>\n<p>Unvaccinated people, meanwhile, are staying alive and, in most cases, are thriving while their &#8220;fully vaccinated&#8221; counterparts continue to develop VAIDS (vaccine-induced AIDS) or drop dead from &#8220;sudden adult death syndrome,&#8221; also known as SADS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In every single month since the beginning of 2022, partly vaccinated and double vaccinated 18-39-year-olds have been more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds,&#8221; reports <i>Exposé News</i>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Triple vaccinated 18 to 39-year-olds however have had a mortality rate that has worsened by the month following the mass booster campaign that occurred in the UK in December 2021.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Babies everywhere are dying due to fallout from covid injections</h2>\n<p>Another trend occurring all around the world in the most fully jabbed countries is an excess of newborn baby deaths. For the second time in seven months back in March, dead newborns hit critical levels, the data shows.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>An astounding 4.6 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births was recorded in March, a 119 percent increase beyond expected levels. Back in September 2021, an even larger peak of 5.1 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births was seen.</p>\n<p>Public Health Scotland (PHS) launched an investigation that flew mostly under the radar. Its conclusion? Babies are dying due to &#8220;factors beyond random variation&#8221; – the injections were not mentioned.</p>\n<p>In Germany, Taiwan and elsewhere, birth rates have similarly been on a decline, either due to fully jabbed women not being able to get pregnant, or because babies die not long after being born.</p>\n<p>The so-called Pfizer documents address this, it turns out, mentioned deep within the data that upwards of 90 percent of covid-jabbed pregnant women end up losing their babies. (Related: Pfizer was <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-19-pfizer-documents-fda-adverse-events-unrelated-vaccine.html\" target=\"_blank\">recently caught</a> lying about jab-related adverse events.)</p>\n<p>Were it not for a court order, by the way, these and other critical revelations in the Pfizer documents never would have seen the light of day.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) further shows that post-covid injection miscarriages are at least 1,517 percent higher than post-flu shot miscarriages.</p>\n<p>As of this past April, some 4,113 unborn babies have died, that we know of, due to complications associated with Fauci Flu shots. Of these, 3,209 were specifically attributed to Pfizer&#8217;s mRNA (messenger RNA) injection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CDC has admitted that just 1 to 10% of adverse reactions are actually reported to VAERS therefore the true figure could be many times worse,&#8221; <i>Exposé News</i> explains.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But to put these numbers into perspective, there were only 2,239 reported foetal deaths to VAERS in the 30 years prior to the emergency use authorisation of the Covid-19 injections in December of 2020.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, medicine regulators continue to peddle the lie that based on &#8220;animal studies,&#8221; there are no direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy caused by Chinese Virus shots.</p>\n<p>Then we have ovarian cancer, rates of which are rising dramatically due to Operation Warp Speed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Imagine the smug triple jabbed that abused the unjabbed the last two years now reading this article,&#8221; wrote a commenter. &#8220;Talk about having to eat some humble pie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The latest news about Chinese Virus injections can be found at <a href=\"http://chemicalviolence.com\" target=\"_blank\">ChemicalViolence.com</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://expose-news.com/2022/08/07/pfizer-docs-official-data-covid-vaccines-causing-depopulation/\" target=\"_blank\">Expose-News.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-19-pfizer-documents-fda-adverse-events-unrelated-vaccine.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-pfizer-documents-data-covid-jabs-mass-depopulation.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Pfizer documents and real-world data both show that covid jabs are already causing mass depopulation\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-pfizer-documents-data-covid-jabs-mass-depopulation.html&linkname=Pfizer%20documents%20and%20real-world%20data%20both%20show%20that%20covid%20jabs%20are%20already%20causing%20mass%20depopulation\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-pfizer-documents-data-covid-jabs-mass-depopulation.html&linkname=Pfizer%20documents%20and%20real-world%20data%20both%20show%20that%20covid%20jabs%20are%20already%20causing%20mass%20depopulation\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-pfizer-documents-data-covid-jabs-mass-depopulation.html&linkname=Pfizer%20documents%20and%20real-world%20data%20both%20show%20that%20covid%20jabs%20are%20already%20causing%20mass%20depopulation\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-pfizer-documents-data-covid-jabs-mass-depopulation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '107', '2022-08-15 10:58:38', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:02:06', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-15 19:01:54', '2032-08-12 19:01:59', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '8', '', '', '1', '1', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Ron DeSantis, who continues to be mentioned as a long-term successor to former President Donald Trump, has taken action against a far-left state attorney whose campaign was financed by progressive billionaire George Soros.</p>\n<p>In an announcement on Thursday, DeSantis said he sent state law enforcement officers to remove State Attorney Andrew Warren', 'of the 13th Judicial Circuit from office for his &#8220;militant agenda&#8221; and refusal to enforce duly-passed laws he disagrees with.</p>\n<p>“State Attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda,” <a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/desantis-17-65224/\">DeSantis noted in a statement</a>. “It is my duty to hold Florida’s elected officials to the highest standards for the people of Florida. I have the utmost trust that Judge Susan Lopez will lead the office through this transition and faithfully uphold the rule of law.”</p>\n<p>According to his order: “As of the signing of this Executive Order, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, assisted by other law enforcement agencies as necessary, is requested to: (i) assist in the immediate transition of Andrew Warren from the Office of the State Attorney for the 13th Judicial Circuit of Florida, with access only to retrieve his personal belongings; and (ii) ensure that no files, papers, documents, notes, records, computers, or removable storage media are removed from the Office of the State Attorney for the 13th Judicial Circuit of Florida by Andrew Warren or any of his staff.”</p>\n<p>Warren was removed following an assessment of state attorneys by DeSantis&#8217; office, which found that in June the DA vowed <a href=\"http://www.abortions.news\">not to charge abortion patients</a> or their physicians who illegally perform abortions after the state&#8217;s 15-week ban.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>“We had the individual here from Hillsborough County say and signed letters that there are certain laws he just won’t enforce and won’t prosecute,” DeSantis told Fox News exclusively following a press conference announcing the suspension.</p>\n<p>“States attorneys that put their ideology over the rule of law are not satisfying their oath of office,” said DeSantis, himself a Harvard-education lawyer and Yale graduate who served as a judge advocate in the U.S. Navy and an assistant U.S. Attorney.</p>\n<p>In a tweet last month, Warren wrote: “The 15-week ban is unconstitutional on its face. Tallahassee knew it when it passed the bill hoping judges will ignore the privacy right in FL Constitution.”</p>\n<p>“I put my hand on the Bible and swore to defend the US &amp; Florida Constitutions. Florida’s Constitution has a privacy right that clearly covers abortion.

Investigators detected a higher-than-normal rate of adverse events in pets, including fever, pain, allergies and shock symptoms. Three pets were reportedly hospitalized after vaccination. So far, no animal deaths have been reported. The agency has verified ten adverse events per 100,000 vaccinations and wants to investigate both the importer and the manufacturer for errors related to shipment, contamination and product defect. Meanwhile, Israel continues to ignore hundreds of thousands of citizens who have been either injured or killed by COVID vaccines.</p>\n<h2>Israeli government taking animal vaccine injuries seriously, while ignoring hundreds of thousands of injured humans</h2>\n<p>Israel’s MOA issued a statement, calling for greater vaccine safety for animals: &#8220;The Ministry of Agriculture continues to monitor the reports, and is in contact with the importer and the global manufacturer. At the same time, the veterinary services at the Ministry of Agriculture are in contact with the authorized veterinarians and veterinary clinics.”</p>\n<p>“We know of three cases that required hospitalization and several dozen reports of local symptoms, who were immediately treated with antihistamines and released,&#8221; Dr. Hilik Marom reported.</p>\n<p>The Israeli government’s sudden interest in vaccine safety for animals comes at a time when hundreds of thousands of people are reporting injuries and deaths from the COVID jabs. The Israeli government is currently ignoring all pharmacovigilance data for the disastrous COVID vaccine, pretending that hundreds of thousands of medical issues are just imaginary, made-up conspiracy theories. However, when it comes to the rabies vaccine, a few vaccine-injured animals are a serious issue.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-09-israeli-data-25-spike-emergency-heart-problems-fully-vaccinated.html\">A shocking study out of Israel</a> recorded a 25 percent increase in cardiac events among young Israeli men (16-39 years old), post-vaccination. The study, which was peer reviewed by MIT researchers, found out that the uptick in cardiac events “seems to track closely the administration of 2nd dose vaccines.” The cardiac events were not related to covid-19 infection either. The rate of cardiac events was compared to the rate of cardiac events in 2019 and 2020. The year 2020 was when young people were branded as “super spreaders” and told to stay home, lest they die from COVID in droves. It turns out that excess deaths in young people were much higher after they were forced to vaccinate. It turns out that labeling young people as “super spreaders” and locking them down is a malicious false guilt tactic to isolate them, drive them to depression, drug use and suicide, while compelling their participation in deadly, heart-damaging experiments.</p>\n<p>The MOA ignored the report and mocked it as “misinformation.” This has been the sordid trend for most governments, as they continue on in a state of denial and delusion, mocking the very people who have been injured or killed by the COVID vaccine and all the related abuse pushed forth by governments. Israel explicitly colluded with Pfizer to oppress the Israeli population with vaccine passports, lockdowns, isolation and segregation, forcing inoculations onto the people as if they were a bunch of beagles caught up in <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-02-beagle-freedom-project-calls-out-dr-anthony-fauci-torture-criminal.html\">Fauci’s unethical experiments</a>.</p>\n<h2>Independent committee detects excess death increase of 15% with COVID vaccine, dwarfing pandemic mortality rates</h2>\n<p>Back in May 2021, the Israeli People&#8217;s Committee compiled a <a href=\"https://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dpbhnvgov/content/Boards/BOH/Meetings/2021/PC%20255b.pdf\">report of adverse events related to the covid vaccine</a>. This independent group includes physicians, lawyers, scientists and researchers from a wide range of academic disciplines. This group is not afraid to speak up on what they are seeing.</p>\n<p>After Israel rolled out the COVID vaccine program, the excess mortality data for January through March 2021 (14,398 deaths) dwarfed that of 2020 (12,575 deaths). The year 2020 was when the population was supposed to be dying in droves due to a pandemic. Instead, there was a 15 percent increase in excess mortality after the COVID vaccines were unleashed!</p>\n<p>After the early vaccine rollout, the Committee looked at 2,346 reports of <a href=\"http://vaccinedamage.news\">vaccine injury</a>, which included 330 death reports. Most of the deaths were related to sudden adult death syndrome, heart attacks, strokes and other sudden cardiac events. A host of other issues were also reported, ranging from Bell’s palsy, autoimmune flare ups, blood clots, eye disorders, pneumonia, rashes, neurological impairment, miscarriages and other serous inflammatory disorders and organ problems. Sadly enough, the Israeli government ignored the initial safety signals and launched vaccine passports to increase compliance with the deadly experiment.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://americasfrontlinenews.com/post/israel-government-investigating-rabies-vaccine-for-animals-after-10-adverse-events\">AmericasFrontlineNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-09-israeli-data-25-spike-emergency-heart-problems-fully-vaccinated.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-02-beagle-freedom-project-calls-out-dr-anthony-fauci-torture-criminal.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dpbhnvgov/content/Boards/BOH/Meetings/2021/PC%20255b.pdf\">DPNV.ph.gov</a> [PDF]</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-israel-wants-to-halt-rabies-vaccine-for-animals-adverse-events.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Israel wants to HALT rabies vaccine for animals after just 10 adverse events, but won’t stop covid vaccines for humans after hundreds of thousands of injuries and deaths\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-israel-wants-to-halt-rabies-vaccine-for-animals-adverse-events.html&linkname=Israel%20wants%20to%20HALT%20rabies%20vaccine%20for%20animals%20after%20just%2010%20adverse%20events%2C%20but%20won%E2%80%99t%20stop%20covid%20vaccines%20for%20humans%20after%20hundreds%20of%20thousands%20of%20injuries%20and%20deaths\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-israel-wants-to-halt-rabies-vaccine-for-animals-adverse-events.html&linkname=Israel%20wants%20to%20HALT%20rabies%20vaccine%20for%20animals%20after%20just%2010%20adverse%20events%2C%20but%20won%E2%80%99t%20stop%20covid%20vaccines%20for%20humans%20after%20hundreds%20of%20thousands%20of%20injuries%20and%20deaths\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-israel-wants-to-halt-rabies-vaccine-for-animals-adverse-events.html&linkname=Israel%20wants%20to%20HALT%20rabies%20vaccine%20for%20animals%20after%20just%2010%20adverse%20events%2C%20but%20won%E2%80%99t%20stop%20covid%20vaccines%20for%20humans%20after%20hundreds%20of%20thousands%20of%20injuries%20and%20deaths\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-israel-wants-to-halt-rabies-vaccine-for-animals-adverse-events.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '110', '2022-08-15 10:50:42', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:14:03', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-15 19:01:54', '2032-08-12 19:01:59', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '6', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Individuals who are not “freshly vaccinated” within the past three months are subject to restrictions throughout German society. Every time a person complies with a new booster jab, they are awarded their “freedoms” back. This new system is being rolled out under German’s “Infection Protection Act.”</p>\n<h2>Vaccine Passport tyranny intensifies in Germany as well conditioned citizens become full-on slaves</h2>\n<p>The new vaccine passport app is dubbed the Corona-Warn-App (CWA). It assigns a specific color to individuals who have complied with the latest round of booster jabs. Individuals who do not show this color on their app will be threatened with mask mandates, testing requirements, and isolation, among other restrictive discriminatory acts that the German government concocts at any given moment.</p>\n<p>Those who are not “freshly boosted” with COVID jabs are assigned a color based on their unworthy vaccination status. The CCP-style vaccine passport system assigns multiple tiers of “rights” based on a person’s compliance with the current medical dictatorship. Citizen slaves who have survived multiple rounds of COVID jabs must still wear masks, must still show proof of a negative COVID test, and take further orders from the government if they are not “freshly vaccinated” in the past three months. In some instances, the app accepts a negative COVID test in place of a recent booster shot, granting the color a person needs in order to forgo mask mandates and isolation orders. Berliner Zeitung said the new vaccine passport app would “give different rights in the future” depending on the latest ‘public health guidance.’</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>(Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-20-germanys-birth-rate-falls-11percent-first-quarter-2022.html\">Germany&#8217;s birth rate improbably falls by 11% in the first quarter of 2022</a>).</p>\n<h2>Vaccine passports are the proving ground for denouncing one’s faith and declaring obedience to evil, false authorities</h2>\n<p>Germany’s app update is similar to China’s color-coded vaccine passport system. A green light permits citizen-slaves to move about freely. The yellow code denies them access to society, ordering the slave citizen to stay home for seven days. The red code is issued to lock slave citizens down for two weeks at a time. Lauterbach said Germany will change the rules and close the mask exemption if too many freshly vaccinated people “take advantage” of the color assigned to them.</p>\n<p>The COVID jabs were never immunizations, to begin with. Individuals without discernment are learning the hard way, about what is really taking place globally. COVID jabs destroy the immune system and cause inflammation to the body’s vital organ systems. They are being used as a tool of deception to destroy human health and enslave populations. It’s <a href=\"http://mindcontrol.news\">mind control</a>. It’s about testing people’s integrity and faith. Vaccine passport apps are just the proving grounds for more psychological control and spiritual oppression.</p>\n<p>Countries are beginning to <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/taiwan-combines-vaccine-passport-with-digital-id-number/\">rollout digital IDs</a> and surveillance devices such as wristbands and ankle bracelets. This totalitarian system is ultimately going to demand compliance with even more sinister and controlling beliefs, which will require further bodily obedience, biological surveillance, social credit scores, and perpetual kneeling to false, demonic authorities. In the end, this system is about denouncing one’s faith and devoting one’s life to a deceptive, abusive one-world government. It’s a Godless, mark-of-the-beast system of psychological terror and obedience to mass murder.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/germany-vaccine-passport-color-codes/\">ReclaimtheNet.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-20-germanys-birth-rate-falls-11percent-first-quarter-2022.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/taiwan-combines-vaccine-passport-with-digital-id-number/\">ReclaimtheNet.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-germanys-vaccine-passport-system-gets-upgrade-restricts-freedoms.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Germany’s vaccine passport system restricts freedoms based on color-coded tiers, vaccine booster status\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-germanys-vaccine-passport-system-gets-upgrade-restricts-freedoms.html&linkname=Germany%E2%80%99s%20vaccine%20passport%20system%20restricts%20freedoms%20based%20on%20color-coded%20tiers%2C%20vaccine%20booster%20status\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-germanys-vaccine-passport-system-gets-upgrade-restricts-freedoms.html&linkname=Germany%E2%80%99s%20vaccine%20passport%20system%20restricts%20freedoms%20based%20on%20color-coded%20tiers%2C%20vaccine%20booster%20status\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-germanys-vaccine-passport-system-gets-upgrade-restricts-freedoms.html&linkname=Germany%E2%80%99s%20vaccine%20passport%20system%20restricts%20freedoms%20based%20on%20color-coded%20tiers%2C%20vaccine%20booster%20status\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-germanys-vaccine-passport-system-gets-upgrade-restricts-freedoms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '111', '2022-08-15 10:49:41', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:06:15', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-15 19:01:54', '2032-08-12 19:01:59', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '5', '', '', '1', '2', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

But according to the <em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em> (CDC), there is <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-cdc-claims-link-between-heart-inflammation-and-covid-19-vaccines-wasnt-known-for-most-of-2021_4638716.html\" target=\"_blank\">no known link</a> between these health conditions', 'and the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) &#8220;vaccines.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request calling for CDC reports about the post-injection risk of heart inflammation, the <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/052190_cdc_corruption_private_corporation_vaccine_industry.html\" target=\"_blank\">private corporation posing as a public health agency</a> pleaded ignorance about the matter, claiming it had no idea that Fauci Flu shots could damage the human heart.</p>\n<p>The CDC team that responded to the FOIA request said it is relying on data from the government-run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is co-managed by both the CDC and the <em>Food and Drug Administration</em> (FDA). They used the passive reporting system to look at jab-related injuries reported between April 2, 2021 and Oct. 2, 2021.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases performed a search of our records that failed to reveal any documents pertaining to your request,&#8221; Roger Andoh, a CDC records officer, told the<i> Epoch Times</i>, adding that &#8220;an association between myocarditis and mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was not known at that time.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>CDC head denies link between COVID injections and heart inflammation</h2>\n<p>Israeli authorities and the United States military were the first to report publicly about COVID jabs causing heart inflammation. They did this in April 2021, long before the CDC bothered to even acknowledge any such link.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Rochelle Walensky, the CDC head whose husband has <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-11-cdc-director-husband-took-millions-grants-pharmaceuticals.html\" target=\"_blank\">raked in millions</a> from corrupt government &#8220;grants,&#8221; claimed that after looking into the matter, no safety signal was found linking the shots to either myocarditis or pericarditis.</p>\n<p>It took until late June of this year for the CDC to finally admit that the available data does, in fact, &#8220;suggest an association with immunization.&#8221; By the time August arrived, the CDC actually started using the word &#8220;harm&#8221; to describe the situation.</p>\n<p>We know for a fact that Walensky and the rest of her kind at the CDC have been lying to the American public all this time. They knew all along that the shots were deadly but played dumb about it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Either the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing at CDC, or federal health officials are disseminating misinformation about what they knew about myocarditis following mRNA COVID vaccines and when they knew it,&#8221; said Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC).</p>\n<p>According to Fisher, the CDC&#8217;s claim that it did not know of any such link between the shots and heart inflammation &#8220;is provably false.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) directly addressed the FOIA response from the CDC, explaining that it &#8220;raises even more questions about the agency&#8217;s honesty, transparency and use, or lack thereof, of its safety surveillance systems, such as VAERS, to detect COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have sent two letters to the CDC about the agency&#8217;s inability to find records demonstrating its use of the vaccine surveillance systems,&#8221; he added in a statement. &#8220;To date, the CDC has failed to respond to my letters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the CDC told the <i>Times</i> in an email that this was all just a big <i>oopsie</i>, and that the CDC just needs to issue a &#8220;correction&#8221; concerning the matter and all will be well.</p>\n<p>That so-called correction will do absolutely nothing to reverse all the injuries and deaths that occurred, but this is how matters are almost always handled when the government commits crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>The latest news coverage about Chinese Virus injections and the prolific damage they are causing to human health can be found at <a href=\"http://chemicalviolence.com\" target=\"_blank\">ChemicalViolence.com</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-cdc-claims-link-between-heart-inflammation-and-covid-19-vaccines-wasnt-known-for-most-of-2021_4638716.html\" target=\"_blank\">TheEpochTimes.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/052190_cdc_corruption_private_corporation_vaccine_industry.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com 1</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-11-cdc-director-husband-took-millions-grants-pharmaceuticals.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com 2</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-cdc-pleads-ignorance-covid-jabs-heart-inflammation.html\" data-a2a-title=\"CDC pleads ignorance about link between COVID jabs and heart inflammation\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-cdc-pleads-ignorance-covid-jabs-heart-inflammation.html&linkname=CDC%20pleads%20ignorance%20about%20link%20between%20COVID%20jabs%20and%20heart%20inflammation\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-cdc-pleads-ignorance-covid-jabs-heart-inflammation.html&linkname=CDC%20pleads%20ignorance%20about%20link%20between%20COVID%20jabs%20and%20heart%20inflammation\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-cdc-pleads-ignorance-covid-jabs-heart-inflammation.html&linkname=CDC%20pleads%20ignorance%20about%20link%20between%20COVID%20jabs%20and%20heart%20inflammation\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-cdc-pleads-ignorance-covid-jabs-heart-inflammation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '107', '2022-08-15 10:48:53', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:02:06', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-15 19:01:54', '2032-08-12 19:01:59', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '4', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Kinney III notes that the &#8220;agency previously engaged in ‘covert efforts to influence social policy and political action’ and at times used methods ‘reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian regimes,\'&#8221; as noted in an April 1976  Senate report called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94755_II.pdf\">Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The report is the work of the so-called &#8220;Church Committee,&#8221; which was chaired by Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho). The report details corruption and covert operations including the use of propaganda by the FBI and the broader U.S. intelligence community in order to effect certain political outcomes (sound familiar?).</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Committee&#8217;s findings and conclusions concerning abuses in intelligence activity and weaknesses in the system of accountability and control are amply documented. I believe they make a compelling case for substantial reform,&#8221; Church wrote in a report summary. &#8220;The recommendations section of this volume sets forth in detail the Committee&#8217;s proposals for reforms necessary to protect the right of Americans. The facts revealed by the Committee&#8217;s inquiry into the development of domestic intelligence activity are outlined in the balance of the volume.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other language that is completely foreign to the Democratic Party today as well as far too many Republicans, Church continued:</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p><em>I would add one principal comment on the results of the Committee&#8217;s inquiry: The root cause of the excesses which our record amply demonstrates has been failure to apply the wisdom of the constitutional system of checks and balances to intelligence activities. Our experience as a nation has taught us that we must place our trust in laws, and not solely in men. The founding fathers foresaw excess as the inevitable consequence of granting any part of government unchecked power. This has been demonstrated in the intelligence field where, too often, constitutional principles were subordinated to a pragmatic course of permitting desired ends to dictate and justify improper means.</em></p>\n<p>In short, Church and his committee, then, uncovered the same kind of FBI and intelligence community abuses that are still so prevalent today, despite the fact that the Church Committee&#8217;s report formed the base of a major intelligence community reform bill still present (but little used) today known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA &#8212; a law that also established a secretive FISA court to hear classified evidence from intelligence agencies seeking electronic and other types of surveillance warrants on foreign entities.</p>\n<p>As we learned through revelations from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 and again when Donald Trump revealed the Obama sycophants had &#8220;wiretapped&#8221; his New York Trump Tower offices, the law doesn&#8217;t work when it is ignored or goes unenforced by men and women who could not care less about trusting in the law.</p>\n<p>Worse, we have come to realize this as well: Today&#8217;s intelligence community has grown so powerful and has so much &#8216;dirt&#8217; on so many lawmakers, oversight efforts like that of the Church Committee are impossible today. Far too few members of Congress appear to be &#8216;clean&#8217; enough to hold the intelligence community (which has failed the country so miserably and so often, as the 9/11 attacks proved) accountable for anything, much less cut its funding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The U.S. Senate report is from 1976; however, while it cannot be completely detailed in this article, there is actually reason to believe that the corruption has increased rather than decreased since 1976. Thus, the examples provided in the report may not be the worst of the worst,&#8221; Kinny writes.</p>\n<p>He is correct, of course: Including <a href=\"http://www.propaganda.news\">the spread of propaganda</a> through friendly media outlets, which is what the IC did to Trump for four years, <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2020-10-16-gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-false-flag-operation-hatched-by-fbi.html\">the FBI has become an entrapment agency</a> while also fomenting false flags like the U.S. Capitol Building &#8216;riot&#8217; to take down political enemies.</p>\n<p>The system our founders developed and bequeathed us is superior, but it depends on honorable men and women applying the law and adhering to the Constitution.

thanks to commodities traders in countries like Switzerland, Singapore and Dubai, where they serve as middlemen for countries that are snapping up heavily discounted Russian crude.</p>\n<p>Even as Joe Biden and idiot Democrats reversed U.S. energy independence achieved by the real president, Donald Trump, the vast majority of the world continues to power their economies on cheap, plentiful fossil fuels, and at negligible &#8216;harm&#8217; to the planet.</p>\n<p>As such, Russia&#8217;s vast energy sector is thriving while countries in Europe that have sanctioned Russian energy are looking at running short of supplies during the fast-approaching and very cold winter, thanks also in large part to foolish overreliance on inefficient &#8220;green&#8221; energy that cannot replace reliable fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the first 100 days of the war, Russia has managed to rake in close to $100 billion in oil sales alone and in fact, higher crude and fuel prices caused by the West &#8220;have allowed Russian oil and gas revenues to climb even after the sanctions forced export volumes to dip,&#8221; <em>OilPrice.com</em> reports.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ultimately, there is no shortage of willing buyers lining up for cheap Russian Urals, nor is there a dearth of middlemen connecting them with Russian energy companies,&#8221; the site&#8217;s report continued.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lurking behind the scenes are Switzerland&#8217;s giant trading houses Vitol, Glencore and Gunvor as well as Singapore&#8217;s Trafigura, all of which have continued lifting large volumes of Russian crude and products, including diesel, amid wide-ranging Western Sanctions on Russia,&#8221; the report adds.</p>\n<p>While Vitol officials have pledged to stop purchasing Russian oil by year&#8217;s end, that is still months away and that pledge could change depending on market conditions. And while Trafigura vowed to cease purchases of crude oil from Russia&#8217;s state-owned Rosneft by mid-May, the trader is still free to purchase Russian crude from other suppliers. And Glencore officials said they would not make any &#8220;new&#8221; trading deals with Moscow, but so far the trader hasn&#8217;t had any issues maintaining current deals.</p>\n<p>At the same time, India and China &#8212; both economies of which are reliant on fossil fuels as they grow and mature &#8212; are also making up for most of Russia&#8217;s lost energy markets.</p>\n<p>New Dehli has significantly increased its purchases of Russian crude, <em>OilPrice.com</em> noted:</p>\n<p><em>India has never been a big buyer of Russian crude despite having to import 80% of its needs. In a typical year, India imports just 2-5% of its crude from Russia, roughly the same proportion as the United States did before it announced a 100% ban on Russian energy commodities. Indeed, India imported only 12 million barrels of Russian crude in 2021, with the majority of its oil sourced from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Nigeria.</em></p>\n<p><em>But back in May, reports emerged of a &#8220;significant uptick&#8221; in Russian oil deliveries bound for India.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.news18.com/news/business/india-spends-5-1-billion-to-import-oil-gas-coal-from-russia-in-3-months-report-5502295.html\">According to a <em>Bloomberg</em> report</a>, India spent some $5.1 billion on Russian oil, gas and coal in the first three months following Moscow&#8217;s invasion, an amount that exceeds five times the value of just a year ago, though China, by far, is the largest buyer of Russian oil.</p>\n<p>It about money, really: International energy monitors have noted that Russia is selling crude at major discounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, the Government of India&#8217;s motivations are economic, not political. India will always look for a deal in their oil import strategy. It&#8217;s hard not to take a 20% discount on crude when you import 80-85% of your oil, particularly on the heels of the pandemic and global growth slowdown,&#8221; Samir N. Kapadia, head of trade at government relations consulting firm Vogel Group, told <em>CNBC</em>, according to <em>OilPrice.com</em>.</p>\n<p>Democrats and our dementia president, whose administration is being run by Barack Obama, are purposely tanking our fossil fuel industry because they know our economy will follow.

After helping to found the rightwing website Breitbart News, he led Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and transitioned to his chief strategist at the White House,&#8221; one of the regime&#8217;s media lapdogs, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-found-guilty-of-obstructing-jan-6-probe\"><em>The Daily Beast</em>, &#8216;reported.&#8217;</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;But it was his role in remaining a close Trump ally that made him a target of the Jan. 6 Committee, particularly because he allegedly helped craft the “Green Bay Sweep” plan alongside since-indicted former White House adviser Peter Navarro. That plan involved pressuring Republican lawmakers to slow down the certification of the electoral college vote in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election,&#8221; the &#8216;report&#8217; continued.</p>\n<p>After the guilty verdict on two counts, Bannon remained defiant. &#8220;I stand with Trump and the Constitution, and I will never back down,&#8221; <a href=\"https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/jury-finds-bannon-guilty-contempt-congress-charges?utm_source=tr&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=trjtn\">he told reporters afterward, outside of the courthouse</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Each count carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of 1 year in prison, so Bannon could go away for as little as 60 days when he is sentenced Oct. 31 or as long as two years &#8212; but it would be safer to bet on the latter sentence since Bannon was already pardoned by Trump for a scam that he wasn&#8217;t really involved in regarding a section of border wall construction.</p>\n<p>The defense did not call any witnesses, not even Bannon himself, but they did argue continually that Bannon was in the process of negotiating with the Jan. 6 committee about providing testimony when he was charged by Biden&#8217;s &#8216;Injustice Dept.&#8217; and hauled into court.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Their argument essentially focused on the dates of the subpoenas and whether they had been finalized,&#8221; <em>Just the News</em> reported, adding: &#8220;However, in closing arguments, they argued Bannon has been denied his constitutional rights in the trial by not being allowed to call to the witness stand House Democrats connected to the committee, including Chairman Bennie Thompson,&#8221; a Mississippi Democrat.</p>\n<p>The outlet went on to describe why the J6 Committee is nothing more than a sham engaged in partisan revenge:</p>\n<p><em>In a departure from House norms, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last year rejected two of the five House Republican picks for the panel, prompting House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) to pull all five of his party&#8217;s choices from the committee. Pelosi then handpicked two anti-Trump Republicans to join the seven Democrats on the committee.</em></p>\n<p>So again, this has never been about seeking &#8216;justice&#8217; for the breach of the U.S. Capitol, it&#8217;s been about political payback for four years of Trump &#8212; which Democrats and RINOs really blame on his voters.</p>\n<p>And to that point, the &#8216;breach&#8217; itself was a false flag operation, as one expert who was on the scene that day has observed. J. Michael Waller, who was at the Capitol that day, <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-21-fbi-finds-zero-evidence-trump-allies-incited-jan-6-breach.html#\">wrote about what he saw</a> in a piece for The Federalist a week after the breach:</p>\n\n<em><strong>Plainclothes militants</strong>. Militant, aggressive men in Donald Trump and MAGA gear at a front police line at the base of the temporary presidential inaugural platform;</em>\n<em><strong>Agents-provocateurs</strong>. Scattered groups of men exhorting the marchers to gather closely and tightly toward the center of the outside of the Capitol building and prevent them from leaving;</em>\n<em><strong>Fake Trump protesters</strong>.

Inflation is skyrocketing while our rogue government prints money by the trillions, that all seems to disappear before even being utilized for what it&#8217;s supposed to fix or &#8220;build back.&#8221; This whole country will be a &#8220;dead body&#8221; that resembles a third world apocalyptic hell-hole, if the &#8220;bleeding&#8221; isn&#8217;t stopped, and soon. The &#8220;Inflation Reduction Act&#8221; allocates nearly a trillion dollars to making the already-way-too-big federal government bigger, and all at the American tax-payers&#8217; expense.</p>\n<p>The scamdemic has all but bankrupted the entire middle class, and the money &#8220;doctors&#8221; want to pretend they&#8217;re going to slow the bleeding, while we&#8217;re all still bleeding out. What good does that do? What if a surgeon told you that at the hospital, while you&#8217;re losing quarts of blood; &#8220;Hey, good news patient, we&#8217;re going to slow the bleeding so you die a little bit slower.&#8221; &#8220;Why, thank you doctor.

The rest of the money goes to &#8220;taxpayer services&#8221; that help you register everything you owe online to make the &#8220;SS&#8221; collection team&#8217;s job easier.</p>\n<h2><strong>Americans will be squeezed to death by inflation, heavily-armed IRS SS Squads, and supply chain collapse that includes food and water</strong></h2>\n<p>The Democrats are blaming &#8220;pandemic-related office closures&#8221; that they planned themselves. And since when does anyone at the IRS ever pick up a phone anyhow? There are no humans there, just automated labyrinths that keep you frustrated, confused, and out of work, owing more money.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re also blaming all the stimulus checks for their backlog, but they issued those to keep people at home, not working, and how long and how many people does it take to process checks? Are we back in the 1980s, or is that just Biden&#8217;s brain?</p>\n<p>This is a ten-year plan for the IRS, but the money will be gone in no time, untraced, unaccounted for and nothing improved, you can bet your last block of gold on that.</p>\n<p>They say the IRS will now be able to &#8220;strategically target its improvements, year after year,&#8221; meaning target conservatives, non-profit organizations and anyone who defies the false-narratives regarding war, Russia, money-printing, clot shots and the scamdemic.</p>\n<p>Get ready for 87,000 NEW IRS <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-08-inflation-reduction-bill-to-unleash-tax-terrorism-upon-the-american-people.html\">agents to terrorize</a> all the Democrat&#8217;s political opponents.

Newt Gingrich visited Taiwan as House speaker in 1997, but he also stopped in China as part of his Asia tour, and US-China relations were much better than they are today. Pelosi’s visit also followed a pattern of increasingly frequent congressional delegations to the island.</p>\n<p>China’s military is also much more advanced today than it was in the 1990s. In the weeks leading up to Pelosi’s visit, China made it clear that it would view her trip as a provocation and warned that it would respond strongly. After the visit, China launched its largest-ever military exercises around Taiwan, simulated blockading the island, and fired missiles over Taiwan for the first time.</p>\n<p>Campbell also revealed that the US plans to increase trade relations with Taiwan, <a href=\"https://news.antiwar.com/2022/06/02/beijing-calls-on-us-to-stop-trade-talks-with-taiwan/\">another thing Beijing has warned against</a>. “We’re developing an ambitious roadmap for trade negotiations, which we intend to announce in the coming days,” he said.</p>\n<p>Campbell is the co-founder of the hawkish Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank and worked in the State Department during the Obama administration, <a href=\"https://news.antiwar.com/2021/01/13/architect-of-obamas-asia-pivot-to-head-bidens-indo-pacific-policy/\">where he led the policy known as the “pivot” to Asia.</a> Last year, Campbell set the tone for the Biden administration’s China policy by saying<a href=\"https://news.antiwar.com/2021/05/26/bidens-top-asia-official-says-us-engagement-with-china-is-over/\"> the era of engagement with Beijing was over</a> and that the two countries’ relationship will now be defined by competition.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

which it has been pursuing for decades &#8211; of dividing the Palestinians into different camps. It is now forcing them to reunite.</em></p>\n<p>Israel clearly intended to provoke a wave of missile strikes with the arrest of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-forces-arrest-senior-islamic-jihad-leader-raid-kills-palestinian-youth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bassam al-Saadi</a>, a senior member of the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Palestinian</a> Islamic Jihad group (PIJ). For three days, the PIJ did not react. Saadi had been arrested seven times before and even leaked footage of him being dragged by soldiers did not ignite passions. There were no protests in the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Israel then launched its attack on Friday afternoon, killing <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-israel-launches-air-strikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taiseer al-Jabari</a>, the commander of the northern division of al-Quds Brigades (Saraya al-Quds), the military wing of the PIJ, along with five-year-old <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-five-year-old-palestinian-killed-family-mourn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alaa Qaddoum</a>, a 23-year-old woman, and seven other Palestinian men.</p>\n<p>By the standards of this long and bitter conflict, Israel’s attack on Gaza was unprovoked. There is no evidence to support the contention that Jabari was preparing an attack on Israeli tanks.</p>\n<p>Only three hours after the strikes on Gaza did the PIJ unleash a rocket barrage, but Hamas&#8217;s much larger rocket force remained in its silos.</p>\n<p>All of the targets of this campaign are local commanders and relative unknowns, even to Ran Kochav, the spokesperson for the Israeli army <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-logic-behind-attack-anyone-guess-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">who forgot Jabari’s name </a>on live television on Saturday.</p>\n<p>But if the campaign to defang the West Bank is clear, it is equally the case that such an operation would provoke the very uprising it is designed to stem. An armed uprising in the West Bank is no longer a matter of if, only when. This is not just a consequence of the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, whose writ no longer runs in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/israel-palestine-jenin-armed-resistance-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jenin</a>, or indeed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/west-bank-resistance-nablus-mourns-dead-fighters-wave-grows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nablus</a>. Both cities have formed their own brigades.</p>\n<h2><strong>A leadership deficit</strong></h2>\n<p>The formation of new armed cells in territory which has largely eschewed armed resistance since 2007 reflects not only the collapse of the PA, but a leadership deficit within all Palestinian factions, PIJ and Hamas included.</p>\n<p>The cells themselves may be &#8220;inspired&#8221; by the Islamic Jihad movement but their members come from all groups, including Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Put simply, the West Bank is bristling with guns, most of which can be acquired easily on the Israeli market. A new generation of Palestinians is trading in their cars, careers and, ultimately, their own lives for them.</p>\n<p>This decision has little to do with the weight of history. It has more to do with the burden of the present.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>If recognising Israel does not work; if Israel is disinterested in talks that lead to a Palestinian state; if every time Israeli forces attack, the outside <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-gaza-attack-world-reactions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">world commends</a> it for doing so; if vigilante gangs of settlers destroy your olive trees and your houses under the armed protection of Israeli soldiers; if the law that applies to those gangs is <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2019/01/chapter-3-israeli-settlements-and-international-law/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">civilian</a>, but the law applying to you, who are unarmed, is <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/12/17/born-without-civil-rights/israels-use-draconian-military-orders-repress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">military</a>; if your own leaders are corrupt, and refuse to hold elections for decades for fear of the popular vote: what else is there left for you to do? Surrender? Leave for London?</p>\n<p>Israel is under a profound delusion if it thinks that Palestinians will just melt away. This is the last thing on this generation’s mind. They will stand and fight. It&#8217;s not flight they are thinking of, but liberation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Global abandonment</strong></h2>\n<p>Palestinians are as globally connected as any other generation of youths around the world. What exactly is the message world leaders are giving them in their fact-free reactions to the latest bombardments?</p>\n<p>US <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/07/statement-by-president-biden-on-the-ceasefire-in-gaza/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reacted</a> as follows:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;My support for Israel’s security is long-standing and unwavering &#8211; including its right to defend itself against attacks.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Over these recent days, Israel has defended its people from indiscriminate rocket attacks launched by the terrorist group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the United States is proud of our support for Israel’s Iron-Dome, which intercepted hundreds of rockets and saved countless lives. I commend Prime Minister Yair Lapid and his government’s steady leadership throughout the crisis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The statement, which is worth reading in full, had no expression of concern about Israel shooting first. Lapid’s actions were commendable.</p>\n<p>Or what about Britain’s <a href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/pm-hopeful-liz-truss-stands-israel-over-gaza-assault\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prime minister to be</a>, <strong>Liz Truss</strong>? As these events were unfolding, Truss addressed <a href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/pm-hopeful-liz-truss-stands-israel-over-gaza-assault\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conservative Friends of Israel</a> with these words:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;The UK stands by Israel and its right to defend itself.” In her letter to the group, she added: “We condemn terrorist groups firing at civilians and violence which has resulted in casualties on both sides.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To rub salt into the wound, Truss promised to review the location of Britain’s <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/international/article-714112\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">embassy</a>, which is currently in Tel Aviv &#8211; an act which would consign what small role the UK had as a peacemaker or mediator in this conflict to the ashes. There is no domestic pressure for her to do this.</p>\n<p>The EU <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/gaza-statement-spokesperson-latest-developments_en?s=200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acknowledged</a> that the escalation had already led to “a number of casualties” but did not say who they were and which side caused them. France <a href=\"https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/news/2022/article/situation-in-gaza-and-israel-statement-by-the-ministry-for-europe-and-foreign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;deplored&#8221;</a> the Palestinian civilian casualties, but condemned &#8220;the firing of rockets into Israeli territory and reiterates its unconditional commitment to the security of Israel&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Only the UN and the Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney broke ranks &#8211; by inches, not feet. Ireland said it was &#8220;deeply concerned&#8221; by the impact of Israeli strikes on civilians.</p>\n<p>What message do these statements send to the families of the 45 Palestinians who have been killed in these attacks, 16 of them children? What message goes through to the hundreds injured?</p>\n<p>In this case, Israel clearly fired first not because a Palestinian militant group had reacted. But because it did not react. That is something of a first in this conflict.</p>\n<p>And it is applauded for doing so by the very same leaders who are <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ukraine-russia-funding-weapons-budget-military-aid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">arming Ukrainian</a> resistance fighters against Russian occupiers.</p>\n<h2><strong>A dangerous message</strong></h2>\n<p>There can be no clearer demonstration of the hollowness of western values than in their persistent, cynical and criminally responsible failure to bring Israel to book for its actions.</p>\n<p>This is a dangerous message to be sending both sides in the conflict, not least Israel itself.</p>\n<p>Lapid is unlikely to lead public opinion in Israel. Israel’s next generation of soldiers are not following him, rather the likes of the Kahanist<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-ben-gvir-itamar-jewish-supremacist-exploiting-attacks-fan-hate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, who took part in the <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-storm-al-aqsa-mosque-gaza-bombing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storming</a> of the Al-Aqsa Mosque along with his supporters.</p>\n<p>If Benjamin Netanyahu succeeds in forming the next government later this year, the extreme right &#8211; and from a group once classed by the US and Israel as terrorists &#8211; could well be in his cabinet.</p>\n<p>By giving Lapid the greenest of green lights to kill Palestinians at will, western leaders are sending an even more dangerous message to the next generation of Israeli leaders who are openly talking of killing Arabs come what may. They openly threaten Palestinians with another Nakba.</p>\n<p>The latest target of Israel’s operation in the West Bank is described as Israel’s most wanted man in Nablus. But <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2022/08/israel-kills-3-resistance-fighters-in-nablus-one-teen-in-hebron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ibrahim al-Nabulsi was only 19 years old</a>. Before the final firefight of his life, Nabulsi made an audio recording that went <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tamermisshal/status/1556892014217658375?s=12&amp;t=tEWyC2SbGAKlsP3-DGILsA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">viral</a>: “Preserve the homeland after me, and my commandment is for no one to leave gunpowder. I am besieged, and I am going to be martyred,” he said.</p>\n<p>Huge crowds attended his funeral, and those of Islam Sabbouh and 16-year-old Hussein Taha, who died in the same Israeli raid.</p>\n<p>The relief for Israel in his death will be strictly temporary. The obvious fact is that the more Palestinians Israel kills the more they provide a recruiting platform for fighters to replace them.</p>\n<p>Elaine Abu-Shaweesh is all of five or six years old. She was injured in bombings in Rafah on Saturday. Hani Alshaer, a journalist from Gaza, caught her on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cg76YW1phNV/?igshid=NmZiMzY2Mjc%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> with a bloody bandage on her head, and saying: “Israel is not a state, and they are under, under, under my feet. And they are on the ground and are trash and they are not. They are bombing kids and maybe right now they have destroyed our house, because last time they did, last war.”</p>\n<p>No one taught this little girl what to say. But come what may she will grow up to resist what is happening all around her. This is Israel’s work. It is also the world’s responsibility.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The economists write that the reserves are crucial for Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), as the central bank is called, to function. And, without an operational central bank, the Afghan economy is not able to work properly, with many unable to receive salaries and the government unable to perform basic monetary duties and limited in paying for imports.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“As economists — and, among us, former central bankers — we are deeply concerned by the compounding economic and humanitarian catastrophes unfolding in Afghanistan, and, in particular, by the role of US policy in driving them,” the letter states. “We write today to urge you to take immediate action to confront this crisis, above all by allowing the central bank of Afghanistan, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) to reclaim its international reserves.”</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Signers to <a href=\"https://epsusa.org/s/2022-08-10-Economists-Letter-Afghanistan.pdf\">the letter</a> include the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, Jayati Ghosh, Linda Bilmes; Sir Richard Jolly of the University of Sussex; Dean Baker, Eileen Appelbaum, and Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research; and Heidi Shierholtz, Jeff Faux, John Schmitt, and Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute, among many others.</p>\n<p>Andrés Arauz, formerly general director for the central bank in Ecuador, also signed the letter. Arauz recently<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/afghanistan-hunger-crisis-foreign-reserves-central-bank-us-biden/\"> wrote</a> from his experience as a central banker to explain why the reserves are vital to the Afghan central bank’s functioning.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Without access to its foreign reserves, the central bank of Afghanistan cannot carry out its normal, essential functions,” the letter states. “Without a functioning central bank, the economy of Afghanistan has, predictably, collapsed. The people of Afghanistan have been made to suffer doubly for a government they did not choose. In order to mitigate the humanitarian crisis and set the Afghan economy on a path toward recovery, we urge you to allow DAB to reclaim its international reserves.”</p>\n<p>Previously, the<a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2022-01-26/secretary-generals-remarks-the-security-council-afghanistan-delivered\"> UN Secretary-General</a>,<a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/04/afghanistan-un-experts-call-us-government-unblock-foreign-assets-central\"> leading UN human rights experts</a>,<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/586618-dozens-of-democrats-call-on-biden/\"> US lawmakers</a>,<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/06/06/afghanistan-funds-famine-crisis-911-families/\"> families of the victims of the September 11 attacks</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AfgWomAdvGrp/status/1492981028700442630?s=20&amp;t=Nm5H-yhV_aZTuAaMja1RQw\"> Afghan women’s</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WILPFAFGGROUP/photos/a.160593204623141/936638563685264/?type=3&amp;theater\"> groups</a> and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/05/famine-afghanistan-joe-biden-reparations\"> feminist leaders</a>, leading<a href=\"https://cepr.net/press-release/human-rights-watch-humanitarian-groups-at-senate-call-for-change-in-us-policy-in-afghanistan/\"> human rights organizations</a>,<a href=\"https://www.afsc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Afghanistan%20Asset%20Freeze%20CSO%20Letter%20.pdf\"> civil society organizations</a>, and others have called for the release of the Afghanistan Central Bank’s assets.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Seeing how the Foundation promotes synthetic foods as an equitable answer, the end results on public health are bound to be the same</span></em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a recent interview with Roman Balmakov from “Facts Matter,”<sup><span id=\"edn1\" data-hash=\"#ednref1\">1</span></sup> a podcast by The Epoch Times, I discuss how American medicine was reshaped and holistic medicine sidelined by the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, starting in 1910. Before that time, natural medicine — using herbs, homeopathic remedies and general nutrition from food were very popular.</p>\n<p><img class=\"mlazyloaded aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/public/2022/August/trends-and-disparities-in-cardiometabolic-health.jpg\" alt=\"trends and disparities in cardiometabolic health\" width=\"592\" height=\"325\" data-mlazyload-src=\"https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/public/2022/August/trends-and-disparities-in-cardiometabolic-health.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I believe it’s fairly easy to see that the transition from holistic medicine, which treats the cause, to synthetic drugs that only treat symptoms, has been a driving factor behind the rise in metabolic diseases. But before I get into the history I want to share an incredible study published last month that shows 14 out 15 people in the United States are metabolically unfit. This shocking analysis was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</p>\n<p>I am currently writing a new book, and the first chapter details how Rockefeller captured the U.S. medical system through a clever campaign that had his foundation strategically invest $150 million from 1920 to 1930 in medical schools and hospitals. While this may not sound like much today, adjusting for inflation that is between $4 and 5 billion dollars today.</p>\n<p>This investment secured his ability to control the entire medical school curriculum. After 1910 all natural medical therapies were eliminated and replaced with teaching about drugs. Many may not realize that most drugs are derived from petrochemicals<sup><span id=\"edn2\" data-hash=\"#ednref2\">2</span></sup> and oil was what Rockefeller was known for.</p>\n<p>Understanding how medicine was corrupted in the first place can help us understand current-day events as well. In many ways, it’s a repeat of the basic process — identify a problem or shortcoming (whether true or fabricated), pronounce a solution, then tear down the old system and replace it with a new one.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Intentional Suppression of Health</strong></h2>\n<p>Statistics reveal 14 out of 15 American adults are metabolically unhealthy, which is a staggering realization. As I explain in the interview, I’ve spent the last 25 years educating people about the foundations of good health, and warning against that which undermine it, which includes environmental, dietary and pharmaceutical toxins.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been disparaged as a “top misinformation spreader” about COVID, the attacks against me started long before the pandemic, so this is nothing new for me. The fact of the matter is that holistic health and nutrition have been the top threats to allopathic medicine ever since its inception, 112 years ago.</p>\n<p>They’ve been suppressing knowledge about nutrition and natural health ever since they successfully banished these concepts from the medical schools. What’s new is that we now have technologies that greatly facilitate the suppression and censorship of information on the one hand, and allow Big Pharma to blanket the information space with its propaganda on the other.</p>\n<p>The end result is an echo chamber with no diversity of opinion. This is dangerous in any circumstance, but in particular when it comes to health. These technological advancements have also facilitated what professor Matthias Desmet refers to as “<a href=\"https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/the-psychology-of-totalitarianism#details\">mass formation hypnosis</a>,” a psychological condition required for totalitarianism to truly take hold.</p>\n<p>Google is a major player in this social engineering project; 93% of online searches in the entire world are done using Google. But this doesn’t include the dozens of other search engines that use Google’s application programming interface (API) to access the results, which means that number is likely north of 95 to 96%. Indeed, a 2022 report showed that 94% of all mobile and tablet searches are using Google.<sup><span id=\"edn3\" data-hash=\"#ednref3\">3</span></sup></p>\n<p>That number is beyond shocking. Virtually anyone using the internet is relying on Google’s search engine. Please understand that all the information on censored sites still exist but if you don’t have an index or key to locate it, it is the same as if it never existed. Google has very cleverly silently implemented the 21st century version of the burning of the Library of Alexandria.</p>\n<p>Until 2016, it was relatively easy to find information online. Very little was censored. But, over time, and especially over the past six years or so, Google started tweaking algorithms to suppress certain kinds of information that are in competition with Big Pharma, Big Food and other globalist interests.</p>\n<p>Today, that information restriction has reached a zenith. It can be very difficult to get to certain kinds of information, and sometimes you have to bypass labels warning you that you’re about to read something that has been “debunked” and could harm you if followed, and redirectional messages telling you where to go and what to read instead.</p>\n<h2><strong>How the Medical System Was Hijacked</strong></h2>\n<p>As mentioned, Standard Oil mogul John D. Rockefeller was instrumental in corrupting the medical system, turning it from a focus on health to a focus on treating symptoms with petrochemical-derived pharmaceuticals, thereby ensuring that people remain sick — sometimes for life.</p>\n<p>John’s father was William Avery Rockefeller, an authentic “snake oil salesman” who impersonated physicians and conned people into buying his useless “Rock Oil” tonic for cancer — a mixture of laxative and petroleum. Avery once admitted he would cheat his children every chance he got, in order to “make ‘em sharp.”<sup><span id=\"edn4\" data-hash=\"#ednref4\">4</span></sup> Evidently, John D. learned the lessons of duplicity and fraud well.</p>\n<p>In 1901 — after dismantling the public transportation system in the U.S. and taking over the public education system — Rockefeller set his sights on the medical industry. He founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and appointed Dr. Simon Flexner, a professor of experimental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania, to head it up.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Flexner’s brother, Abraham, was commissioned by Rockefeller and Henry Pritchett, then-president of the Carnegie Foundation,<sup><span id=\"edn5\" data-hash=\"#ednref5\">5</span></sup> to write a report on the state of the American medical education system. One of the goals of this study, which became known as The Flexner Report,<sup><span id=\"edn6\" data-hash=\"#ednref6\">6</span></sup> was to improve the credibility of the medical profession.</p>\n<p>The now infamous term “trust the science” that Fauci and others famously promoted has its roots in this report, which was published in 1910, as it sought to impress the importance of scientific medicine. It’s really impossible to overstate the impact the Flexner report had on medicine, as it led to a complete and radical overhaul.</p>\n<p>Virtually every natural medical therapy was criminalized and about half of all medical schools were forced to shut down. Natural medicine practitioners were put out of business and replaced with doctors who practiced scientific medicine. Natural remedies and ancient effective cures were dismissed as quackery.</p>\n<p>The only medicines deemed reputable were patentable synthetic drugs, invented in the oil cartel’s own research centers. The new system also put into place barriers for Blacks and women, making it very difficult for them to get into medical school. Similar changes took place in hospitals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Rockefeller Yesterday and Today</strong></h2>\n<p>Through the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the Flexner report, extravagant donations to strategic partners and investments in the pharmaceutical industry, Rockefeller gained unprecedented control over the entire medical system, from education and science to hospitals and the drug companies themselves.</p>\n<p>John D. died in 1937 (actually about a mile from where I currently live), but his legacy lives on. To this day, the Rockefeller family owns about 50% of all drug companies, and The Rockefeller Foundation has played a central role in the global cabal’s effort to impose worldwide totalitarianism.</p>\nThe Rockefeller Foundation is now leading the charge toward a new food system centered around synthetic and lab grown foods, which will have the same effects on health as the late John D. Rockefeller’s ‘new and improved’ allopathic medical system.\n<p>For example, the Rockefeller Foundation was part of Event 201,<sup><span id=\"edn7\" data-hash=\"#ednref7\">7</span></sup> in which the authoritarian response to COVID was laid out, and in July 2020, it published “Reset the Table: Meeting the Moment to Transform the U.S. Food System,”<sup><span id=\"edn8\" data-hash=\"#ednref8\">8</span></sup> which calls for a restructuring of the entire food system to make it more “fair and equitable.”</p>\n<p>According to the Foundation, the pandemic revealed deep problems in the U.S. food system that need to be “reset,” much in the same way that the Flexner report found problems in the medical system that needed to be fixed by changing it from the ground up.</p>\n<p>So, the Rockefeller Foundation is now leading the charge toward a new food system centered around synthetic and lab-grown foods, which will have the same effects on health as the late John D.’s “new and improved” allopathic medical system.</p>\n<h2><strong>They’ve Declared Their Plan for a Food Crisis</strong></h2>\n<p>As I mention in the interview, the globalist cabal, which includes The Rockefeller Foundation, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and many other entities and individuals, are not necessarily shy about telling us their plans.</p>\n<p>It’s detailed in publicly available reports, in interviews, mainstream media articles and during the annual meeting in Davos. So, if you’re observant, and believe what they’re actually saying, you can know what’s coming. Right now, we’re repeatedly told that the food system is not working, climate change is destroying food production and that to survive, we need to get used to eating insects and drinking reclaimed sewage.</p>\n<p>Gates is calling on the Western world to abandon real meat and transition to lab-grown meat which he, of course, is invested in. The Netherlands and Canada are now imposing nitrogen restrictions that will result in farmers being put out of business, and food distribution centers are mysteriously burning down around the world.</p>\n<p>All the signs for a manufactured food crisis are here. I was a Boy Scout as a youth, and their motto, “Be Prepared,” has served me well. And, certainly, if there ever was a time to get prepared, it’s now.</p>\n<p>They’re dismantling the food system in order to replace it with patented foods, in the same way Rockefeller replaced natural herbs and nutrition with patentable synthetic chemicals a century ago. So, if you can, you’d be wise to stock up on food to last three to six months, or more.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Global Genocide?</strong></h2>\n<p>On top of the intentional destruction of our food supply to justify the “build back better” agenda, which is basically code for the implementation of worldwide tyranny, we’re also facing a worldwide agenda that appears intent on taking as many lives as possible in coming years.</p>\n<p>And that includes children. In late June 2022, the United States became the first country in the world to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID jabs for toddlers as young as 6 months. The Food and Drug Administration issued the EUA June 17,<sup><span id=\"edn9\" data-hash=\"#ednref9\">9</span></sup> and the very next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended all toddlers get the shot as soon as possible.<sup><span id=\"edn10\" data-hash=\"#ednref10\">10</span></sup></p>\n<p>The sad reality is that our regulatory authorities are an absolute sham. They want you to believe there are agencies looking out for your best interest, but they’re actually fronts for the drug industry. Shockingly, they’re not even above sacrificing children in their efforts to generate maximum profits for their masters pulling the strings.</p>\n<p>As I’ve described in other articles, the apparent reason for why they’re doing this is because the COVID jab makers want the jab to be put on the childhood vaccination schedule. When that happens, they’ll have permanent immunity against lawsuits for any injuries and deaths that happen and will not have to rely on the EUA any longer.</p>\n<p>This is the same kind of liability shield they have under EUA, but to breach the gap from EUA liability shield to permanent liability shield, they need to get it onto the childhood vaccination schedule. The EUA for young children and toddlers was a necessary step toward that. Time will tell how many children end up injured or killed by this decision.</p>\n<p>If the adverse event profile is anything like that of adults, we’ll be looking at tens of thousands of dead children within a year or two. Fortunately, so far, only 2% of young children in the U.S. have received the jab. So, even many parents who gladly got the shot themselves now realize that there’s something wrong here.</p>\n<h2><strong>FDA and CDC Are Corrupt Beyond Repair</strong></h2>\n<p>In my view, giving the COVID jab to children is the most egregious and outrageous decision ever reached in American medicine. It’s just beyond shocking. But it’s not surprising.</p>\n<p>In fact, it was anticipated, for the simple fact that these agencies have been thoroughly corrupted and had, all throughout the COVID pandemic, demonstrated that that corruption. Bioethics are nonexistent. Human morals are out the window.</p>\n<p>All that matters, it seems, is the reign of Big Pharma’s latest innovation, this gene transfer technology, which the transhumanist cabal intends to play with over time to usher in their nonhuman utopia. They want humans merged with machines.</p>\n<p>They want our brains hooked up to the cloud so our thoughts can be monitored and, undoubtedly, “corrected” from an external source. The Great Reset is not only a reset of our financial system and our food system; it’s the reinvention of the human species.</p>\n<h2><strong>Evidence of Fraud</strong></h2>\n<p>Now, as I mention in the interview, one of the things that gives me hope is that we’re now seeing clear evidence of fraud, which is the only thing that might break the iron clad liability shield these companies have been given.</p>\n<p>In September 2021, a group called Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FDA to obtain the documentation used to approve Comirnaty, including safety and effectiveness data, adverse reaction reports and lists of active and inactive ingredients.</p>\n<p>When, after a month, the FDA still had not responded to the FOIA request, the PHMPT sued.<sup><span id=\"edn11\" data-hash=\"#ednref11\">11</span></sup> The FDA and Pfizer asked the court to grant them, first for 55 years and then 75 years, to release it all, but they were overruled. As a result, we’re getting around 55,000 pages or so per month. You can find them all on PHMPT.org.<sup><span id=\"edn12\" data-hash=\"#ednref12\">12</span></sup></p>\n<p>A tranche of Pfizer documents released in March 2022 included a whopping nine pages of recorded side effects — 158,000 in all! They knew the jab caused heart problems, myocarditis, stroke, blood clots, neurological problems — you name it, it’s there. Yet they didn’t tell the public, and neither did the FDA.</p>\n<h2><strong>Murder for Profit</strong></h2>\n<p>This is in some ways similar to the case of Vioxx. Merck knew the drug was causing lethal heart problems but suppressed the information for years — for financial reasons. Vioxx was a blockbuster drug, pulling in $2.5 billion a year.<sup><span id=\"edn13\" data-hash=\"#ednref13\">13</span></sup> By the time the FDA took the drug off the market, it had already killed at least 60,000.</p>\n<p>The COVID jabs, meanwhile, are the biggest blockbusters in medical history. In 2021, Pfizer made $36.7 billion from its shot, Moderna made $17.7 billion. Combined, they project $51 billion in sales for 2022.<sup><span id=\"edn14\" data-hash=\"#ednref14\">14</span></sup></p>\n<p>Merck was willing to sacrifice 60,000 lives for an annual profit of $2.5 billion, which is downright paltry in comparison to the COVID jabs. Is it any surprise then that the accepted number of injuries and deaths from the COVID jabs appear to be unlimited? In short, these self-serving, profit-at-any-cost decisions are nothing new. It’s just on a scale we’ve never seen before.</p>\n<p>Pfizer far exceeds Merck’s crimes and profits as they forecast $32 billion in revenue for their COVID jab in this year alone and another $22 billion for oral COVID 19 treatment Paxlovid. And, this year, the company expects to rake in more than $50 billion in global revenue from just those two medications to treat COVID 19. But, get this, their total revenue for 2022 will likely be over $100 billion!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our justice system is nearly as perverted as our regulatory system, but if we were somehow to get an impartial court, and Pfizer were to be convicted of fraud, they would lose all their liability protection and could be held financially liable for every injury and death from their COVID jab, the damages for which would probably run in the trillions of dollars.</p>\n<h2><strong>Join the Great Rejection</strong></h2>\n<p>In the meantime, I believe we’re in for hard times. Government will likely continue pushing for more mRNA jabs, the WHO will continue its power grab to control health decisions worldwide, food shortages will likely become reality, the censoring of truth will continue and people we know and love who took the jabs may suffer and die.</p>\n<p>It could continue getting worse for two or three years, maybe longer. So, prepare for all of it, mentally, emotionally, physically and materially. As intent as the global cabal is on a Great Reset, we need to be just as intent on a Great Rejection of their plans.</p>\n<p>Many systems do need to be dismantled and rebuilt, especially our regulatory, financial, educational and medical systems, but they need to be rebuilt by us, the citizens of each nation, not the technocratic, transhumanist billionaires who believe the right to rule is theirs alone.</p>\n<p>As for our so-called health agencies, they’ve demolished every ounce of trust there ever was, and I suspect the only way the American people will ever accept advice from them again is if there’s a complete reboot. Not a single administrator or adviser from the old guard can be left. Not a single process can be left unrevised. Missions need to be revamped and oaths to protect public health need to be written and sworn.</p>\n<p>All of this will take time and effort, but it can be done. So, I encourage you to search your heart to determine what role you may be able and willing to play once the antihuman globalists are knocked off their pedestal and the true rebuilding begins.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

These include the threat of NATO embracing Ukraine and of the military alliance moving closer to the Russian border: [2]</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We have run out of patience&#8230;The West has been driven by hubris and has exacerbated tensions in violation of its obligations and common sense.” [3]</p></blockquote>\n<p>Additionally,<strong> Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei</strong> <strong>Ryabkov</strong> had pointed out that he could “neither confirm nor exclude” the prospect of dispatching military assets to Venezuela and Cuba if the U.S. and its allies did not refrain from further building its own fortifications ever closer to the Russian border![4]</p>\n<p>From the stand-point of the U.S. and its allies, this incident is largely instigated by Russian soldiers massing tens of thousands of troops at the border with Ukraine – an ominous sign that after <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-russian-president-putin-took-crimea-from-ukraine\">“annexing” Ukraine after the political changeover in 2014</a>, the plan was an illegal invasion of the country. A U.S. Bill, backed by Senate Democrats and the White House would impose sweeping sanctions on the Russian Government, military officials, key banking institutions and President Putin himself if the State engaged in hostilities toward Ukraine.[5]</p>\n<p>Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> said in reply that such a move would be “ comparable to a break in relations,&#8221; and that ties between the U.S. and Russia would completely unravel. [6]</p>\n<p>It was definitely Russia that declared that the Ukraine joining NATO would be a “red line” that would provoke severe consequences if crossed. After three decades of the hostile alliance sneaking closer and closer to the Great Bear, these words seem to be real, the likes of which we haven’t heard throughout the entire end of the Soviet Union. If the U.S. sticks to its rhetoric as well, are we then looking at a third world war? Possibly leading to nuclear annihilation!</p>\n<p>The threat at stake, possibly even on a par with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 seems very evident, although the consequences haven’t quite dawned on much of the West. We will however make it a priority on this week’s episode of the Global Research News Hour.</p>\n<p>In our first half hour,<strong> Glenn Michalchuk</strong> of <a href=\"http://peacealliancewinnipeg.ca/\">Peace Alliance Winnipeg</a> drops by to articulate the demands of his and similar groups across the country relating to Canada’s role in restoration of peace. We also play part of an interview recorded last week with geopolitical analyst and investigative journalist<strong> Pepe Escobar</strong> about the direction this stand-off was headed and about the role of Kazakhstan as playing a sneaky behind the scenes role in the chaos. Finally in our second half hour we have a talk with the long time foreign correspondent in Russia<strong> John Helmer </strong>about the larger context and the factors giving Russia an edge.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Glenn Michalchuk </strong>is Chair of <a href=\"http://peacealliancewinnipeg.ca/\">Peace Alliance Winnipeg</a></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Pepe Escobar</strong> born in Brazil, is a correspondent and editor-at-large at Asia Times and columnist for Consortium News and Strategic Culture in Moscow. Since the mid-1980s he’s lived and worked as a foreign correspondent in London, Paris, Milan, Los Angeles, Singapore, Bangkok.  His most recent book is entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Raging-Twenties-Great-Politics-Techno-Feudalism/dp/1608882330\">Raging Twenties: Great Power Politics Meets Techno-Feudalism</a>. He is also a frequent contributor to Global Research.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>John Helmer</strong> is the longest continuously serving foreign correspondent based in Moscow, and directs his own independent bureau there. He has been a professor of political science, sociology and journalism, and has advised government heads in Greece, the United States and Asia.

It took control of the remnants of the now decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant and has taken over the largest nuclear plant Zaporizhzhia supplying a fifth of the nation’s power needs. [2]</p>\n<p>The UN Refugee Agency reports that the operation generated one million refugees in seven days. UN High Commissioner for Refugees <strong>Filippo Grandi</strong> said that in almost forty years working on refugee emergencies, “rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.” [3]</p>\n<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> referred to Putin in his State of the Union Speech as “a Russian dictator, invading a foreign country.” He is “enforcing powerful economic sanctions” on the state and promises that “when the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.” [4]</p>\n<p>While the Russian invasion is <a href=\"https://indepthnews.net/index.php/opinion/5061-as-threats-of-war-loom-over-ukraine-the-illegality-of-nato-is-laid-bare\">arguably illegal</a>, the popular messaging about the war both in the corridors of power and in major media reports has been far too simplistic. Are we the ‘allies’ of Ukraine truly reacting to a move by Russia that Biden referred to as “unprovoked?” Was the messaging about Nazis in Ukraine and the tyranny of the Ukrainian government against the people of the Donbass just made up in order to brainwash his own citizens into going along with the crusade of war?</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>It is said repeatedly that “in times of war, truth is the first casualty.” With the high stakes in this drama, the Global Research News Hour will attempt to find the context to the facts of the invasion of Ukraine that we have been allowed to verify, and put forward proposals that could relieve Ukraine of an escalating slaughter.</p>\n<p>In our first half hour,<strong> Dr Leon Tressell</strong> a writer and analyst based in the United Kingdom talks at length about the reality of the repression of people in the Eastern-most region of Ukraine by the Ukrainian government and the demonstrable reality of Nazis serve to provide more background of the motives of President Putin’s planning. In our second half hour, peace activist <strong>Bruce Gagnon</strong> talks about long-standing plans by the U.S. to “overextend” and “unbalance” Russia, justifying to some extent Russian feelings of being cornered. Finally, <strong>Tamara Lorincz</strong> as a member of the Voice of Women for Peace focused on the need for Canada to back out of NATO and promote certain moves to de-escalate the situation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dr Leon Tressell</strong> is a historian of geopolitics and writes for Southfront.org</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Bruce Gagnon</strong> is a long time peace activist and coordinates the <a href=\"http://www.space4peace.org/\">Global Network Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power in Space</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>T</strong><strong>amara Lorincz</strong> is a member of Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, a PhD candidate, Balsillie School of International Affairs, Wilfrid Laurier University, and a fellow with the Canadian Foreign Policy Institute.</em></p>\n<p>For more information on the March 6 list of events promoting a <strong>World-wide Global Day of Action for </strong><strong> Peace in Ukraine </strong>check out the site <a href=\"https://worldbeyondwar.org/events/\">https://worldbeyondwar.org/events/</a></p>\n<p><strong>(Global Research News Hour Episode 346)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>LISTEN TO THE SHOW</strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://radio4all.net/responder.php/download/111829/123106/134571/?url=http://www.radio4all.net/files/scottprice666@hotmail.com/4319-1-GRNH_346_Mar_4.mp3\">Click to download the audio (MP3 format)</a></strong></p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em>The <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/theme/global-research-news-hour\">Global Research News Hour</a> airs every Friday at 1pm CT on <a href=\"http://ckuw.ca/\">CKUW 95.9FM</a> out of the University of Winnipeg.
