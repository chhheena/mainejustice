All it takes is common sense, logic and reason, which he shows in spades. The most comprehensive independent researcher who ever lived, who the mainstream and alt news both dislike because they know he&#8217;s telling the truth. Everything is fake, including all the deaths. Start at 2013 and read all his papers in order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mileswmathis.com/writings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">http://mileswmathis.com/writings.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danny</p>\n\n\n\n<p>______________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Guest Posting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to write and/or publish an article on Operation Disclosure all you need to do is send your entry to&nbsp;UniversalOm432Hz@gmail.com&nbsp;applying these following rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The subject of your email entry should be: &#8220;Entry Post | (Title of your post) | Operation Disclosure&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-16\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n<div id=\"M747604ScriptRootC1200280\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Must be in text format<br>&#8211; Proper Grammar<br>&#8211; No foul language<br>&#8211; Your signature/name/username at the top<br>______________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Newsletter</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to receive the daily Operation Disclosure Newsletter, you can&nbsp;subscribe via the PayPal &#8220;Subscribe&#8221; button located on the site.<br>______________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our mission at Operation Disclosure is to bring you important news events and raw intel from various sources focused on exposing the Deep State/Cabal and their downfall.

Citing people briefed on the call, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-sought-to-send-message-to-biden-on-taiwan-now-is-no-time-for-a-crisis-11660240698?page=1\">Xi emphasized that both sides</a>Â must <strong>&#8220;maintain peace and security&#8221;</strong> while reiterating Beijing&#8217;s longstanding position on the Taiwan question.</p>\n<p>Of course, the call failed to prevent Pelosi&#8217;s visit to Taipei, which in turn sparked over a week of unprecedented People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) drills encircling the island, effectively erasing the median line which separates the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p>The WSJ details that &#8220;Mr. Xi decided to talk to Mr. Biden <strong>to minimize the risks of a conflict with the U.S.</strong>, according to the people familiar with the decision-making process.&#8221; The main public messaging from Xi and his foreign policy officials was to warn the US that it is &#8220;playing with fire&#8221; in stoking pro-independence feelings.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Beijing in the lead-up to the crisis thought a last-ditch personal appeal by Xi was worth it, even though &#8220;Chinaâs foreign-policy establishment has historically been careful about scheduling leader-to-leader engagements, <strong>concerned about a loss of face </strong>should the other side do something contrary to Beijingâs interests soon after the bilateral exchange.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WSJ report notes further that the ultra-provocative ballistic missile launch wherein 11 projectiles were fired into waters off Taiwan, some having even flown directly over the island, was just as much Xi showing strength to the domestic populace as it was a threatening message to Taiwan pro-independence forces.</p>\n<p>It remains according to theÂ <em>Journal</em>,Â that Xi in ordering such large-scale military exercises sought to warn of the high cost associated with any future trips to the self-ruled island by US officials, or even other <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-sought-to-send-message-to-biden-on-taiwan-now-is-no-time-for-a-crisis-11660240698\">world leaders</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Beijing worries that Mrs. Pelosiâs visit <strong>could trigger a &#8220;domino effect&#8221; of other world politicians traveling to Taipei, boosting its international standing and potentially encouraging a declaration of independence</strong>, according to the people with knowledge of Chinese thinking.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTVoice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GTVoice</a>: China can calmly decide how to punish Pelosi based on the investigation results, striking precise blows step by step and making Pelosi fully feel the lasting pain and loss of Chinese sanctions. <a href=\"https://t.co/yqjOGVuLuw\">https://t.co/yqjOGVuLuw</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Global Times (@globaltimesnews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1557754935181471744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 11, 2022</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The report also concludes that &#8220;Even though Beijingâs long-stated goal is to bring Taiwan under its rule, the people said, its focus for now remains preventing the self- governed island from moving toward formal independence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This week, Taiwan&#8217;s <strong>main opposition party Kuomintang began a controversial &#8220;fact-finding&#8221; trip to the mainland</strong>.Â KMT vice-chairman Andrew Hsia has described it <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3188392/taiwans-opposition-kuomintang-delegation-begins-trip-mainland\">as aiming to</a> <strong>boost cross-strait communication</strong>; however, it has limited influence in Taipei and the trip has been met with angry condemnation from rival Taiwan politicians.</p>\n<p>As &#8220;punishment&#8221;, so far the Chinese government has issued personal sanctions on Pelosi, and more importantly has canceled a series of bilateral talks ranging from energy to climate to military. The heretofore military-to-military dialogue was widely seen as of prime importance, with the risk now having grown of the potential for unintentional conflict or miscalculation as US warships continue patrolling waters near China.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, this about summarizes where things now stand&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The US âis vowing to continue sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait and to conduct air operations in the region in response to Chinese military drillsâ around Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Translation: The US will respond to Chinaâs response to US provocations by continuing to provoke China.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Stephen Gowans (@GowansStephen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GowansStephen/status/1557737413467709441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 11, 2022</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Emails obtained by U.S. Right to Know show the strategies they used over the next two and a half years.</em></p>\n<p>The emails are a rare window into the pesticide industryâs playbook for trying to keep a group of controversial pesticides on the American market. The industry group touted pesticide industry efforts to protect pollinators, collaborated closely with the Maryland Department of Agriculture, and tried to recruit a bee expert to testify on their behalf, among other efforts to defeat the bills.</p>\n<p>Neonicotinoids, or neonics, are the most <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-022-03267-5\">widely used insecticides in the world</a>. They are <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa1190\">toxic</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46554\">bees</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7069410/\">other pollinators</a>. The <a href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/plants/pesticides/approval-active-substances/renewal-approval/neonicotinoids_en\">European Union has banned several neonics</a> for outdoor use out of concern for pollinators. Over the winter of 2014 to 2015 when Maryland delegates drafted the first bill banning neonics, the stateâs beekeepers lost 45 percent of their honey bee colonies. Globally, wild and domestic pollinator <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-111847\">species are in decline</a>. There is a growing body of <a href=\"http://www.tfsp.info/assets/WIA_2015.pdf\">evidence </a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12459\">linking neonics to pollinator declines</a>.</p>\n<p>Although the Maryland Department of Agriculture has never attributed a bee kill to neonics, neonics have<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ee/article/50/5/1095/6305931\">caused</a><a href=\"https://www.cabi.org/isc/FullTextPDF/2011/20113401182.pdf\"> mass bee deaths</a><a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/reports-publications/pesticides-pest-management/fact-sheets-other-resources/neonicotinoid-pesticides-bee-health.html\"> in other places</a>. Studies have <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12459\">demonstrated</a> that neonics <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.13392\">at levels found in the environment</a> can impair bee brain cells, which makes them worse at navigating, foraging, and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28446783/\">flying</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sb-198-2016-final.pdf\">Maryland Pollinator Protection Act</a> was signed into law in May 2016, after a stronger bill died in committee in <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jan-30-2015-SB-163.pdf\">2015</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.mgaleg.maryland.gov/2014RS/bills/hb/hb1285f.pdf\">2014</a> version limited neonic purchases to certified pesticide applicators, but was withdrawn by its sponsor.</p>\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jan-30-2015-SB-163.pdf\">2015</a> and <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sb-198-2016-final.pdf\">2016</a> bills required labeling all neonic-treated seeds or plants sold in the state, and limited the sale of neonic insecticides to certified applicators (with exceptions for farmers and veterinarians), the <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sb-198-2016-final.pdf\">2016 bill</a> passed only after legislators removed the labeling requirement, exempted pet treatments, lice and bedbug treatments, and indoor pest control products, and exempted people working under the supervision of certified pesticide applicators and farmers.</p>\n<p>The law effectively banned neonic insecticide use except for certified pesticide applicators, farmers, and veterinarians, effective January 1, 2018. It imposed a $250 fine for first-time violations.</p>\n<p>Delegate Anne Healey and five cosponsors introduced the original bill, <a href=\"https://www.mgaleg.maryland.gov/2014RS/bills/hb/hb1285f.pdf\">HB 1285</a>, to the Maryland state house on Feb. 7, 2014. Five days later, on February 12, Lynne Hoot, who was then a lobbyist for CropLife America and the executive director of Maryland Grain Producers and Maryland Agricultural Associates, a consulting firm that lobbied and provided public relations for agricultural associations, <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Hoot-2.13.14-total.pdf\">emailed</a> a small group detailing âwhat I think we need to kill HB 1285.â</p>\n<p>Recipients included staff from neonic producers Bayer and Syngenta, <a href=\"https://ethics.maryland.gov/wp-content/uploads/filebase/lobbyists/lobbyists-listings/Nov-Emp14.pdf\">lobbyists</a> for CropLife America and the Maryland Farm Bureau, and staff from Maryland Department of Agriculture. Hoot, who said she was prompted to do so by Bayerâs Director of State Affairs Allen Ayers, offered to coordinate the âcirculation of supporting documentationâ to oppose the bill.</p>\n<h2><strong>The industry group outlines their key strategies</strong></h2>\n<p>Hoot <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Hoot-2.13.14-total.pdf\">asked the group</a> how similar bills in other states fared and what information was used to defeat them. She also suggested the group cite research that implicated non-pesticide causes of U.S. pollinator decline, and frame the issue as one for the Environmental Protection Agency, not individual states, to decide.</p>\n<p>âAnything we can showcase that EPA is on top of this will help us,â she wrote, before assigning â<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Hoot-2.13.14-total.pdf\">action items</a>â to the Maryland Department of Agriculture, CropLife America and others. Hoot also noted that some people in the nursery industry said they supported the bill, because it might bring them new business. âI did ask if they were OK with the precedent of the state legislature managing their business one product at a time, hopefully they will reconsider,â she wrote.</p>\n<p>There are few windows into the pesticide industryâs strategies to counter pollinator concerns, but many of the Maryland industry groupâs tactics are reflected in an internal <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6594019-CLA-Pollinator-Issue-Management-Plan.html\">2017</a> CropLife America memo published in <i>The Intercept</i>âs 2020 article <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/18/bees-insecticides-pesticides-neonicotinoids-bayer-monsanto-syngenta/\">The Pesticide Industryâs Playbook for Poisoning the Earth</a>. These strategies include building strong relationships with regulatory agencies, positioning the pesticide industry as a defender of bee health, and emphasizing non-pesticide factors like disease and varroa mites as the most significant causes of pollinator decline.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-17925 aligncenter\" src=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PPA-screenshot-1-300x40.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" srcset=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PPA-screenshot-1-300x40.jpeg 300w, https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PPA-screenshot-1.jpeg 681w\" alt=\"\" width=\"675\" height=\"90\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Excerpt from Hootâs âaction itemsâ in her February 2014 email. This point, which references the Maryland Green Industries Council (MAGIC) lobbying organization and the Maryland Association of Soil Conservation Districts (MASCD), discusses finding the best people to talk to legislators about the bill, and to âshow we careâ about pollinator habitat</span></p>\n<p>In the next two years, the industry groupâs <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/march-7-2015-strategy-and-mailing-list-with-all-the-names.pdf\">mailing list</a> swelled to include 32 representatives from pest and landscaping companies, nurseries, and farms, plus chemical giants Dow, Monsanto, DuPont, and GrowMark. Some were registered lobbyists, and several on the email list represented companies that manufactured neonics. Maryland Agricultural Associatesâ lobbyist Lindsay Dodd took over group facilitation from Hoot. (Dodd changed her last name to Thompson after the summer of 2015.)</p>\n<p>Dodd organized conference calls to strategize about who should testify to the stateâs General Assembly, what talking points to use, and what delegates to lobby at key points in the billsâ progression, according to the emails.</p>\n<h2><strong>Industry groups sought âindustry friendlyâ message from U. Maryland bee researcher</strong></h2>\n<p>On February 10, 2015, <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dively-recruitment.png\">a CropLife America representative said</a> he asked Bayer staff to recommend âany local bee expert that may be available to testify and be able to deliver an industry friendly message.â They suggested recently retired University of Maryland entomologist and bee expert Galen Dively.</p>\n<p>Although a Bayer representative <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dively-confirmation.pdf\">told the group</a> Dively was âwilling and available to help outâ later that day, Dively never testified, he confirmed to U.S. Right to Know.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>âAs I recall, the opportunity to testify did not come up,â Dively said. âThey probably sensed that I was not that negative on removing neonics from the homeowner uses. I would have been supportive of keeping neonic labeled uses for ag crops but that was not the main focus of this act.â</p>\n<h2><strong>Industryâs talking points</strong></h2>\n<p>On February 24, 2015, Dodd <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dodd-label-cost-2.24.15.jpeg\">circulated some revised talking points</a> for the upcoming house hearing. <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dodd-label-cost-2.24.15.jpeg\">These points</a> discussed the costs the state and its nursery industry would incur from labeling individual plants, determining whether plants from out-of-state were treated with neonics, testing plant material for neonics to enforce the law, and reduced sales due to a âwarning labelâ on a product.</p>\n<p>Dodd sent out <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/march-7-2015-strategy-and-mailing-list-with-all-the-names.pdf\">another round of testimony coaching</a> on March 7, 2015.</p>\n<p>âEach speaker will likely only have 2-3 minutes and we have a lot to cover. After feedback from the Senate hearing, I think we really need to hammer home the science and be more assertive in refuting the proponents claims,â Dodd wrote.</p>\n<p>In the email, Dodd outlined the âmain ideasâ for the industry group to present:</p>\n<p>â-The label language is completely false according to peer reviewed science.</p>\n<p>-Neonicotinoids are safe when used according to the labeled directions. These labels are legally binding and EPA has already updated them to further protect pollinators.</p>\n<p>-No peer reviewed, un-debunked, scientific study using realistic environmental doses has demonstrated lethal or sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on pollinators.â</p>\n<p>Anti-neonic advocates refuted these points in their testimony.</p>\n<p>âMajor knowledge gaps remain regarding the fate of neonics in the environment and their toxicity to non-target organisms,â University of Maryland Professor Carys Mitchelmore<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/carys-mitchelmore-testimony.pdf\"> testified in support of the bill</a> in 2015. âHowever, in the data that does exist, it is clear that the current use of neonicotinoids are likely to be impacting a broad range of non-target taxa, including pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates and hence threatens a range of ecosystem services.â</p>\n<p>Anti-neonic advocates also cited the<a href=\"http://www.tfsp.info/assets/WIA_2015.pdf\"> International Union for the Conservation of Natureâs Task Force on Systemic Pesticidesâ 2015 publication,</a> which reviewed more than 1,121 peer-reviewed studies and called for immediate restrictions on neonics. They also cited Marylandâs own<a href=\"https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/LegisLegal/2015-Pollinator-Health.pdf\"> Department of Legislative Services 2015 report</a> on the issue, which said âevidence shows that the application of pesticides, particularly insecticides, kills or weakens thousands of honey bee colonies in the United States each year.â</p>\n<h2><strong>Industry group assigns speakers to deliver talking points during testimony</strong></h2>\n<p>In the March emails, Dodd <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/march-7-2015-strategy-and-mailing-list-with-all-the-names.pdf\">included 18 âkey pointsâ</a> to make in testimony, including: âNeonicotinoids have never been determined to be the cause of a bee death reported to the Maryland Department of Agriculture.â</p>\n<p>The industry group tried to discredit scientific studies that concluded neonics endanger pollinators, and promoted others that found no sublethal effects. Other talking points touted EPA and Congressional Research Service publications that emphasized non-pesticide causes of pollinator decline. One said, âtalk about the positive things that industry is doing to understand and enhance pollinator health and habitat.â</p>\n<p>By March 9, 2015, the <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/march-7-2015-strategy-and-mailing-list-with-all-the-names.pdf\">group had assigned </a>speakers to deliver the eighteen âkey pointsâ during the house hearing. For example, Mark Schlosberg of the Maryland Association of Green Industries (MAGI) was assigned to deliver this: âNeonicotinoids are selective insecticides that do not target beneficial insects such as bees and earth worms.â Bayer scientists Iain Kelly and Becky Langer-Curry, meanwhile, were assigned to say that âmany neonicotinoid products actually help to enhance the health of bees by protecting their habitat and forage,â and speak on âthe general chemistry of neonicotinoids, their life-cycle and persistence. Why we started using neonics compared to other classes (without throwing currently registered products under the bus).â</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-17924 aligncenter\" src=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PPA-screenshot-2-300x51.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" srcset=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PPA-screenshot-2-300x51.jpeg 300w, https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PPA-screenshot-2.jpeg 732w\" alt=\"\" width=\"606\" height=\"103\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The talking points that Bayer Scientists Iain Kelly and Becky Langer-Curry were assigned to deliver at the hearing included testifying that neonics were better for pollinators than alternative pesticides, and âactually help to enhance the health of beesâ</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Maryland Department of Agriculture backs industry arguments</strong></h2>\n<p>Maryland Department of Agriculture staff were copied on the industry groupâs strategy emails. They periodically <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Holko-2.13.14.jpeg\">provided other industry members</a><a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Holko-2.12.15.jpeg\"> with information helpful</a> to the industry groupâs testimony.</p>\n<p>The MDA testified in person and in writing against various versions of the Pollinator Protection Act, citing a lack of department resources. For example, in their<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MDA-testimony-feb-17-2015.pdf\"> February 17, 2015 testimony</a>, the MDA estimated they would need $1 million per year to enforce the billâs neonic-treated plant labeling provision, which the bill did not provide.</p>\n<p>The MDA also echoed reasons that were also on the industry groupâs <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/march-7-2015-strategy-and-mailing-list-with-all-the-names.pdf\">list of talking points,</a> including that the bill was unlikely to help pollinators, and it was the wrong avenue for making change.</p>\n<p>âTo date, MDA has not documented any cases of neonicotinoid insecticides negatively impacting honeybees in Maryland,â they wrote.</p>\n<p>The state already inspected honey bee hives, and were making efforts to improve hive health through different avenues, they testified.</p>\n<p>âIt is our position that EPA has always taken the lead on pesticide registration and labeling issues,â <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MDA-testimony-feb-17-2015.pdf\">the MDA wrote</a>. âMDA also feels that these restrictions would create confusion in the distribution chain and market place.â</p>\n<p>In June 2014, <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Oct-1-2014.pdf\">Dodd asked MDA staff</a> if she could fill a vacancy on Marylandâs<a href=\"https://mda.maryland.gov/about_mda/Pages/Pesticide-Advisory-Committee.aspx\"> Pesticide Advisory Committee</a>, which advises the stateâs Secretary of Agriculture on pesticide issues. That October, <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Oct-1-2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MDA staff endorsed Dodd</a> and won her appointment.</p>\n<h2><strong>Environmentalists say MDA is too friendly with the pesticide industry</strong></h2>\n<p>Environmentalists say the emails show clear regulatory capture. âThe emails validate what we have seen in so many other instances, where it appears the MD Dept of Agriculture is the mouthpiece for the agro-chemical industry. Remember, this bill had nothing to do with agricultureâit applied to consumer products only. So why was MDA a key opponent in this?â Maryland Pesticide Education Network (MPEN) Coordinator Bonnie Raindrop wrote.</p>\n<p>âWhat is notable is that a lobbyist for the industry [Dodd] was the one leading the charge, actually preparing the strategy against the bill, and telling MDA what to say! This underscores the inappropriateness of allowing MDA to regulate thousands of highly toxic pesticides,â Raindrop wrote.</p>\n<p>âMDA has no expertise concerning the public health or environmental impacts of these toxics. Their focus is advancing industrial agriculture. These emails underscore that MDA is a highly industry-captured agency.â</p>\n<p>Raindrop and MPEN founder Ruth Berlin advocated for the various Pollinator Protection Act bills. They alerted key legislators to Marylandâs heavy pollinator losses and their related concerns about neonicotinoids, provided data, and lobbied for the bills.</p>\n<p>The billâs success in 2016 wasnât the end of MPENâs activity, either. Although the law took effect at the start of 2018, beekeeper allies reported that neonic products were still for sale to the general public in home and garden stores, Raindrop said. When MPEN volunteers checked, staff in about one in every three affected stores said they hadnât even heard about the law change.</p>\n<p>âThen we became aware that MDA was misinterpreting language in the law, which was intended to allow over 100 Restricted Use Product (RUP) retailers to sell neonic pesticides to certified applicators, to allow these RUP retailers to also sell banned consumer products to the public,â Raindrop wrote. âSo in 2021, we provided issue education to support passage of a bill that closed this loophole.â</p>\n<p>They succeeded in changing the law in 2021.</p>\n<p>The Maryland Department of Agriculture did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<h2><strong>The MDAâs actions were not illegal, but conflicted with some of the departmentâs duties</strong></h2>\n<p>It is generally not illegal for state departments to work with advocates, including paid lobbyists, to support or oppose legislation, government watchdog group Campaign Legal Centerâs Kedric Payne said.</p>\n<p>However, the MDA did not clearly disclose it was collaborating with the pesticide industry on its testimony, making it all the more influential, State Senator Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Baltimore counties) said. Lam sponsored the 2016 version of the Pollinator Protection Act.</p>\n<p>âI think it carries more weight,â he said, when a state department testifies, compared to an advocacy organization. âWe actually, as a legislature, prefer that departments weigh in on billsâ¦ because at the end of the day, theyâre the ones implementing it,â he said.</p>\n<p>However, the MDA testified during a time when it was unusual for state departments to do so, and their strong opposition could have led some legislators to believe that the MDA was providing good information, Lam said, âbut it was very clearly slanted and skewed.â</p>\n<p>âMost legislators donât have a background in science. They rely on other information to make decisions,â Lam said.</p>\n<p>That can come from other legislators, state department representatives, or outside lobbying organizations like the Farm Bureau.</p>\n<p>âThe challenge for a lot of my colleagues is that they may not fully recognize or graspâ¦ the more reliable sources of information,â he said. âIt is not hard to mislead, whether intentionally or unintentionally, fellow legislators, with information that may be skewed.â</p>\n<p>â[The MDA was] not only clearly opposed, but they were working behind the scenes to undermine it,â Lam said.</p>\n<p>The MDA met with legislators and fellow opponents, and âput out information that is marginally accurate but carries the weight of the department,â he said.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SB-198-hearing-1-30-18.png\">misleading poll the MDA presented to the senate</a> during <a href=\"https://mgahouse.maryland.gov/mga/play/4479e385-21b4-4f41-8c0f-8b050fcdcc82/?catalog/03e481c7-8a42-4438-a7da-93ff74bdaa4c&amp;playfrom=2861000\">SB 198</a><a href=\"https://mgahouse.maryland.gov/mga/play/aa3c3f30-2e27-4c9c-b4ce-88be5b1f9066/?catalog/03e481c7-8a42-4438-a7da-93ff74bdaa4c&amp;playfrom=6690000\"> testimony</a> in 2016 indicated that most pollinator stakeholders werenât overly concerned about pesticides â even though <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SB-198-hearing-1-33-07.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only 23 percent of those polled</a> represented beekeepers or conservation organizations.</p>\n<p>Lam said he thought the bill would have worked better if it had been enforced by the Maryland Department of the Environment, rather than the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p>âI am not a big fan of departments and agencies functioning as both the regulator and the advocate or cheerleader for an industry or sectorâ Lam said, due to the inherent conflicts of interest and the confusion it creates about a departmentâs role.</p>\n<p>âIn this instance they were very clearly a cheerleader for the farming industry and much less in their regulator role,â he said.</p>\n<h2><strong>Other state efforts to enact neonic laws are ongoing</strong></h2>\n<p>As of May 2020, the Maryland Pollinator Protection Act was one of six neonic-related state laws in the nation. Twenty-eight more were pending at that time, according to a <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MA-OAG-to-EPA-May-2020.pdf\">table included</a> in a <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/OAG-whole-letter-to-EPA.pdf\">joint letter</a> that nine state Attorneys General sent to EPA in response to EPAâs neonic registration reviews.</p>\n<p>Environmental lobbyist Chris Cowen has helped promote bills to regulate neonics in Minnesota, and said industry tactics are similar across the states.</p>\n<p>âBayer, Syngenta, all the big chemical companies along with the Farm Bureau, along with the big commodity organizations, along with ethanol, theyâre all together. Theyâre all together and they support each other,â he said.</p>\n<p>Itâs common for those companies and organizations to work together with a state department of agriculture, he said.</p>\n<p>âWhat these big companies are really good at doing are working behind the scenes.,â Cowen said.</p>\n<p>One thing that keeps Cowen motivated is that the general public and a good number of legislators support environmental legislation, he said.</p>\n<p>âIâve done a lot of door-knocking and talked to a lot of people, and the average person understands the importance. Clean water [and] healthy soil are what you need to have happy pollinators, and nobody is against that,â he said.</p>\n<p>Although Raindrop acknowledged it would have been better for pollinators if the neonic-treated plant labeling portion of the Maryland bill had also passed, she praised the bill that did pass as a âgroundbreaking winâ that would reduce neonic levels in residential landscapes and set a precedent for other states to pass similar legislation.</p>\n<p>âFederally and at the state and local levels, we see this incredibly well-financed industry spending a lot of money to defeat any and all pesticide protections. That requires continual efforts to move protections forward, sometimes incrementally,â she wrote.</p>\n<p>âIn the arena of pesticides, we are dealing with agencies at the federal and state levels that are industry-captured. And the pesticide industry spends millions to defeat all efforts to put common sense laws in place to protect public health and the environment.Â  Itâs a David vs. Goliath battle. But if the Davids are nimble, smart, and work together, sometimes us Davids win,â Raindrop wrote.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Since 2000, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which monitors cloud seeding operations in the United States, has recorded <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/can-cloud-seeding-help-quench-the-thirst-of-the-u.s.-west\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 50 projects</a>. These programs receive significant governmental funding. Utah, which has one of the largest cloud-seeding programs in the United States, spends up to <a href=\"https://water.utah.gov/cloudseeding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$700,000 annually</a>. (Bizarrely, given Utahâs robust cloud seeding programs, the acting director of the stateâs Department of Natural Resource recently seemed to pitch cloud seeding as a new thing to<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2022/08/04/cloud-seeding-could-bring-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> try to save the Great Salt Lake</a>.)

For example, each of the Western US states using cloud seeding to supplement natural snowpack has <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521003240?casa_token=EpFB5pGEY-cAAAAA:U1iO4JszrP_VAL3o6Mp2Q4fdKlwzht0Ogk8xzQrr8dglDa9Ed7iRnwq1FDZHjki4nNL3bMwpolM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulations</a> on the appropriate time to conduct cloud seeding, as well as limits on when seeding can be done. These limits are meant to ensure that cloud seeding doesnât cause flooding. However, broader governance systems designed to address potential risks posed by cloud seeding are not in place.</p>\n<p>Without significant engagement with potential risks and unintended consequences, cloud seeding is likely to lead to <a href=\"https://www.asocam.org/sites/default/files/publicaciones/files/c8404a470b4795993070a353b8e3d67d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maladaptation</a>, or âaction taken ostensibly to avoid or reduce vulnerability to climate change that impacts adversely on, or increases the vulnerability of other systems, sectors or social groups.â</p>\n<p><strong>âEmpty promises.â</strong> Cloud seeding is emblematic of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/28/opinion/sunday/silicon-valley-techno-optimism.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">techno-optimism</a>, or the belief that technological solutions and ingenuity can solve complex issuesâan attitude <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deeply embedded in American political culture</a>. Despite enthusiasm for cloud seeding, the evidence of its effectiveness is at best mixed. In the words of the World Meteorological Organization <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0160.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Expert Team on Weather Modification</a>, âsometimes desperate activities are based on empty promises rather than sound science.â</p>\n<p>In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences produced <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10829/critical-issues-in-weather-modification-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a study</a> reporting a high degree of uncertainty regarding the efficacy of cloud seeding. Since then, numerous studies have been conducted, but the evidence is still inconclusive. A recent synthesis by the World Meteorological Organization concluded that <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/100/8/bams-d-18-0160.1.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increased precipitation ranged between zero and 20 percent</a>, with the upper range representing conditions under which clouds were highly likely to form precipitation naturally. Particularly concerningly, it is widely acknowledged that <a href=\"https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/planned-weather-modification-through-cloud-seeding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cloud seeding is least likely to be effective during drought conditions</a>, as clouds do not have moisture to release, and yet operations often continue during droughts, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0270467620963708?casa_token=n3uUP77Ylz4AAAAA%3AGGWO-C_0H86PFbiJQkMZ5p7gWlBLX4mQtRpUHd61_Y0rwwWJnsx6mhlvanlY4dQTCjJsBdnQtQjuLQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suggesting that the programs serve more of a political purpose than a climactic or meteorological one.</a></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1917204117#sec-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new study</a> based on an experiment in Idaho known as SNOWIE provided more promising results, but the authors emphasize that it is primarily through the long-term build-up of snowpack that cloud seeding can contribute to water management, and it is unlikely to work as a short-term solution. As the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1716995115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">science of cloud seeding advances</a>, the potential to demonstratively increase precipitation grows, but narrow discussions of the potential efficacy of the technology mask broader conversations about its long-term effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Technological fixes can <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17565529.2019.1624495\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">obscure deeper structural drivers of vulnerability</a> like unsustainable water use and unequal distribution of access to water. Political and policy conversations about water use can conflict with <a href=\"https://open.oregonstate.education/environmentalpolitics/chapter/the-old-west/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strongly held values and beliefs</a>.

Cloud seeding condenses water that is already present in cloud formations. As such, some have argued that <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809513002408?casa_token=uOB8sUrAPMgAAAAA:ocCAZncXQUtuJg8n0m4KhTh7E_WA8hRZ7hXY-NHHj5fAGRenDBTc4QE6j6p5ys3iItTRFF4FFko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cloud seeding cannot impact hydrological cycles at a large scale</a>. But the American Meteorological Society acknowledges that while there is currently no evidence of downwind impacts, these cannot be ruled out, and that âactivities conducted for the benefit of some may have an undesirable impact on others.â</p>\n<p>Despite claims of only local impacts, cloud seeding is already being coordinated at a <a href=\"https://wyofile.com/officials-scrutinize-cloud-seeding-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regional scale across the Colorado River Basin</a>. If adopted widely, cloud seeding could be used politically to deprive certain regions of rainfall (for example as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/03/archives/rainmaking-is-used-as-weapon-by-us-cloudseeding-in-indochina-is.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weapon of war</a>), or to claim water that would otherwise be more widely distributed. These concerns are not hypothetical: in 2020 China announced its â<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/03/china-vows-to-boost-weather-modification-capabilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sky River Plan</a>â to divert water vapor from the Yangtze River basin to the Yellow River basin, a cloud seeding initiative that would cover an area half the size of India. This raises large governance questions about how to ethically divide water and who controls the sky. Without clear policies, including international policy to address transboundary cases, it is likely that the most powerful actors will benefit at the expense of others.</p>\n<p><strong>Certain uncertainties.</strong> Proponents claim that there is little to no evidence of environmental or health harms stemming from cloud seeding. However, silver iodide, the chemical most commonly used to seed clouds is known to be toxic and is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651316302342?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regulated under the Clean Water Act</a> as a hazardous substance. Some studies suggest that the amount of chemicals used is small and the silver iodide is not biochemically available, <a href=\"https://journalofweathermodification.org/index.php/JWM/article/view/178/224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rendering it ecologically harmless</a>. However, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651316302342?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">other studies</a> highlight the potential harms from bioaccumulation, particularly for aquatic life. They show that while overall levels of silver iodide are relatively low, they have exceeded health standards in areas with repeated exposure.</p>\n<p>Precipitation resulting from cloud seeding can also have unintended consequences. For example, a study in the United Arab Emirates demonstrated that cloud seeding operations led to an <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/23/3363\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increase in urban flooding</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125814710015847539\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deathly blizzard in China</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1219-rain-making-linked-to-killer-flood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">severe flooding in the United Kingdom</a> have also been linked to cloud seeding.</p>\n<p>More broadly, the uncertainties that are widely acknowledged in the science of cloud seeding mean that potential harms are not well-understood. The World Meteorological Organization adopted <a href=\"https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=3645\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guidelines</a> in 2017 advising members not to perform weather modification activities without considering the high levels of uncertainty in effectiveness and potential harms involved.</p>\n<p>Silver bullets are appealing because they present simple solutions to complex problems, but only by embracing complexity can leaders around the world ensure that cloud seeding doesnât do more harm than good.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

responsible for the theft of most of the countryâs oil.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âThe amount of oil production during the first half of 2022 amounted to some 14.5 million barrels, with an average daily production of 80.3 thousand barrels, of which 14.2 thousand are delivered daily to refineries,â the oil ministryâs statement said.</p>\n<p>The statement went on to say that âUS occupation forces and their mercenaries,â referring to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), âsteal up to 66,000 barrels every single day from the fields occupied in the eastern region,â amounting to around 83 percent of Syriaâs daily oil production.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>According to the ministryâs data, the Syrian oil sector has incurred losses nearing âabout 105 billion dollars since the beginning of the war until the middle of this yearâ as a result of the US oil theft campaign.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the statement added that alongside the financial losses incurred by the oil sector were âlosses of life, including 235 martyrs, 46 injured and 112 kidnapped.â</p>\n<p>On 10 August, footage filmed by a Russian attack helicopter was released on social media, showing a convoy of trucks operated by the US military, smuggling stolen oil destined for Iraq, out of Raqqah.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\"

the US army, which currently occupies northeast Syria, has been consistently <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/Article/news/4895\">looting</a> the countryâs oil and smuggling it into their bases in Iraq through the illegal Al-Waleed border crossing.</p>\n<p>Local sources in Syriaâs Hasakah governorate reported on 6 August that the US army <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/Article/news/13955\">looted</a> and smuggled dozens of oil tankers out of the country, making it the <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/Article/News/13762\">second</a> stolen oil shipment by the US that week.</p>\n<p>Nearly 200 tanker trucks filled with looted oil were smuggled out of Syria by US troops in July alone, as Washington has intensified its practice of stealing Syrian resources to sell abroad.</p>\n<p>On 19 July, Russian <strong>President Vladimir Putin</strong> <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/Article/news/13275\">called</a> on the US government to stop its consistent looting of Syriaâs natural resources.</p>\n<p>The US military is also responsible for <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/Article/news/11996\">plundering</a> the countryâs wheat, exacerbating an acute <a href=\"https://thecradle.co/Article/News/13355\">food crisis</a>Â that is plaguing Syria and the rest of West Asia.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share

The first one, Ludi Shengtai Xitong Tanjiance (TECIS â Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite), was launched at 03:08 UTC on board a Chang Zheng 4B rocket, better known as the Long March 4B, one of China&#8217;s premier launch platforms. Less than 24 hours later, a second flight of the Chinese Reusable Experimental Spacecraft was launched on a Long March/Chang Zheng 2F.</em></p>\n<p>However, the exact timing of the second launch was not specified. According to various US sources, the Reusable Experimental Spacecraft is a supposed spaceplane, reportedly similar to the design and concept of the Boeing X-37 spaceplane in use by the United States Space Force. No further details were given about the Chinese spacecraft, but <a href=\"https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2022/08/china-double-header/\">NASA Space Flight claims</a> this is the Reusable Experimental Spacecraft&#8217;s second spaceflight.</p>\n<p>The first one was launched in September 2020, with a longer ongoing test series out of space being conducted since at least the early 2010s. Chinese officials state that &#8220;the spaceplane will be used for peaceful purposes&#8221; in space, specifically for &#8220;pilot reuse and on-orbit tech validation&#8221;. The reusable spacecraft will land at an unspecified later date in China. One of the sites presumed to be the landing spot is Lop Nur, with recent satellite imagery showing what appears to be the preparation of the runway for this purpose. At the time of the launch, no NOTAMs (Notice to Air Missions, a notice containing information essential to flight personnel) have been published in preparation for a return and landing.</p>\n<p>The Reusable Experimental Spacecraft is said to possibly originate from the earlier secretive Shenlong project, which was first mentioned in reports back in 2005. The Shenlong itself has <a href=\"http://paper.wenweipo.com/2007/12/11/CH0712110034.htm\">seldom been mentioned or shown since its original reveal in 2007</a>. No exact parameters such as weight, size or other details about the potential payload for the space vehicle have been reported either. As previously mentioned, the launch was conducted on a Chang Zheng/Long March 2F rocket.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>The launch vehicle itself is mostly known for its role as the primary platform for launching the Shenzhou spacecraft, the design of which resembles the layout of the legendary Russian Soyuz spacecraft, although the Chinese space vehicle is somewhat larger. The Chang Zheng/Long March 2F is also known for launching taikonauts (Chinese space program term for cosmonauts/astronauts) to the Tiangong Space Station, China&#8217;s homegrown space platform orbiting in LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) between 340 and 450 km above the Earth&#8217;s surface.</p>\n<p>The Reusable Experimental Spacecraft itself is known to have its own propulsion, much like the Russian 1980s Buran spaceplane, however, it is not entirely clear what kind of thrust it uses and how the spacecraft can raise its orbit. According to NASA Space Flight, for this launch, the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China was used. It was opened in 1999 with its first launch, the Shenzhou 1 mission, and since then has been the place to launch the Shenzhou program and Chinaâs crewed spaceflights. It can launch rockets from the CZ-4 and CZ-11 families. Both launches have been completed without complications and the launched spacecraft have reached the planned orbital altitude.</p>\n<p>Although the spacecraft involved in this launch might indeed have primarily peaceful purposes in mind, the very fact that both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/nato-identifies-space-as-next-operational-domain\">US and NATO increasingly define space as a &#8220;war-fighting domain&#8221;</a> has pushed China and Russia to ramp up their space programs, which will invariably involve the militaries of both (Eur)Asian giants. The Chinese project itself is very likely a response to the US Space Force X-37B pilotless spaceplane. Initially a NASA project during the late 1990s, X-37 was officially transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004. Until 2019, the spacecraft was operated by US Air Force Space Command, after which it was transferred to the newly formed Space Force, a new branch of the US military, which indicates that Washington DC was planning to expand the conflict zone to space.</p>\n<p>The X-37B has made six spaceflights since 2010. The spacecraft likely serves several purposes, including being an in-orbit test platform for developing advanced space-based surveillance sensors, particularly for tracking hypersonic weapons, in which the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-06/hypersonic-missile-delay-puts-u-s-further-behind-russia-china\">US lags significantly behind both Russia and China</a>. The US Space Force acknowledges ownership of at least two X-37B space vehicles. The spaceplane&#8217;s latest flight, launched in May 2020, has seen the X-37B set new records for spaceflight duration, with the current mission now in orbit for 815 days and counting. US military sources claim that the shorter duration of the Chinese spaceplane&#8217;s first flight may indicate that it has a special role in testing hypersonic technologies or other activities related to a high-velocity atmospheric reentry.</p>\n<p>Although the Pentagon officials keep refusing to provide a detailed public account of its mission and activities, the X-37B is clearly seen as a threat by both Moscow and Beijing, as neither of the superpowers can afford to speculate on US intentions. The very fact that the spacecraft is operated by the US military is a clear indicator that this stance is not without merit. Russia is even <a href=\"https://infobrics.org/post/36268\">building land-based laser weapons to counter US space threats</a> and is also <a href=\"https://eurasiantimes.com/hunting-us-spy-satellite-russias-new-inspector-satellite/?amp\">launching its own spacecraft to track US space assets</a> in order to deter the belligerent thalassocracy. As the <a href=\"https://infobrics.org/post/35593/\">United States keeps falling behind strategically</a>, it aims to expand the conflict zone beyond Earth.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Drug Administration on Tuesday expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine to allow for an alternative method of injection and for âhigh-riskâ children under 18 to get the vaccine.</em></p>\n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply\">expanded</a> the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine to allow for an alternative method of injection the agency said would help conserve low supplies.</p>\n<p>The expanded EUA also allows the vaccine to be used in children under age 18 who are at âhigh riskâ of infection.</p>\n<p>Prior to issuing the expanded EUA, the FDA confirmed that ânumerousâ children were granted access to the vaccine on a âcase-by-case basisâ through a special permission process â even though the vaccine was not approved or authorized for emergency use in that age group â <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/monkeypox-vaccine-kids-case-case-basis-fda/story?id=87924596\">ABC News reported</a> on Aug. 4.</p>\n<p>News of the potential dose-sparing recommendations prompted some congressional staff â including from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services â to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/08/monkeypox-dose-sparing-00050375\">question federal health officials</a> about whether using the alternative injection method could affect the efficacy of the shot.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âThey seemed to have no good answers for us, other than denying that it would impact things,â an individual who attended a briefing on the matter told Politico. âBut they didnât present any data.â</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/09/fda-expands-monkeypox-vaccine-authorization-to-increase-dose-supply-five-fold.html\">According to CNBC</a>, monkeypox is rarely fatal and no deaths have been reported in the U.S. However, some patients need to be hospitalized to manage lesions, which can be painful.</p>\n<p>Under the expanded EUA, healthcare providers can administer Bavarian Nordicâs Jynneos vaccine through <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-authorizes-bavarian-nordics-jynneos-emergency-use-against-monkeypox-2022-08-09/\">intradermal injection</a> â meaning between layers of the skin rather than below the skin â instead of subcutaneously, or beneath the skin.</p>\n<p>The change in injection method will <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-authorizes-bavarian-nordics-jynneos-emergency-use-against-monkeypox-2022-08-09/\">increase available doses</a> fivefold â from 441,000 to more than <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/monkeypox-vaccine-intradermal/index.html\">2.2 million</a> â as intradermal injection uses only a fraction of the dose but provides the same protection, health officials said at a White House briefing.</p>\n<p>The FDA said it <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply\">determined</a> the âknown and potential benefitsâ of the monkeypox vaccine âoutweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized uses.â</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>FDA Commissioner <strong>Dr. Robert Califf</strong> said in a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply\">press release</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âIn recent weeks the monkeypox virus has continued to spread at a rate that has made it clear our current vaccine supply will not meet the current demand. The FDA quickly explored other scientifically appropriate options to facilitate access to the vaccine for all impacted individuals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âBy increasing the number of available doses, more individuals who want to be vaccinated against monkeypox will now have the opportunity to do so.â</p>\n<p>Jynneos was <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/jynneos\">approved</a> in 2019 for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox in high-risk adults 18 and older. The approval specified that the vaccine was to be administered subcutaneously, in two doses 28 days apart.</p>\n<p>Using the intradermal method, the vaccine still will need to be administered in two doses, four weeks apart, the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply\">FDA said</a>.</p>\n<p>Children under 18 who are at high risk of monkeypox infection can receive the vaccine by subcutaneous injection, as it is easier to administer and there is not as much data available on the use of the vaccine in this age group.</p>\n<p>The move to allow monkeypox vaccination in children under 18 is based on findings from the vaccineâs use in adults and on data on pediatric smallpox vaccination, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/monkeypox-vaccine-intradermal/index.html\">CNN reported</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the CDC, Jynneos is approved to be <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/pdf/standing-orders-for-administering-vaccine.pdf\">administered subcutaneously</a> into the fatty tissue over the triceps area in the upper arm.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/smallpox-vaccine.html\">vaccine is administered</a> as a âlive Vaccinia virus preparation that is inoculated into the skin by pricking the skin surface.â</p>\n<p>Although the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is conducting a dose-sparing study of the Jynneos vaccine using intradermal injection, it could take months to complete, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/08/monkeypox-dose-sparing-00050375\">Politico reported</a>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/monkeypox-update-fda-authorizes-emergency-use-jynneos-vaccine-increase-vaccine-supply\">based its authorization</a> to allow the vaccine to be administered intradermally on data from a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15008762?via%3Dihub\">study</a> of Jynneos in 524 participants, which âfound a similar immune response when the vaccine was given intradermally in doses one-fifth the size of those given subcutaneously.â</p>\n<p>Only the abstract is publicly accessible, and it is unclear from the abstract whether researchers assessed a smallpox antigen from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/index.html#:~:text=Before%20smallpox%20was%20eradicated%2C%20it,a%20distinctive%2C%20progressive%20skin%20rash.\">variola virus</a> or an antigen from a monkeypox virus.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-grants-full-approval-pfizer-comirnaty-vaccine-adolescents/\">The Defender reported</a>, even the FDA acknowledged <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-grants-full-approval-pfizer-comirnaty-vaccine-adolescents/\">neutralizing antibodies</a> do not correlate with protection, nor does protection against one pathogen <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-do-vaccines-work\">necessarily correlate</a> to protection against another.</p>\n<p>âThere is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/health/monkeypox-vaccine-intradermal/index.html\">no traditional assessment</a> of this vaccine â¦ because there werenât smallpox cases, and the monkeypox outbreaks before this were not large enough to really do a clinical trial,â Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDAâs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>âWe want to collect outcome data, as we do with all vaccines,â Marks said. âAnd Iâd also point out that the NIH [National Institutes of Health] will be mounting a clinical trial and is working through the logistics of that now.â</p>\n<h2><strong>CDC guidance âdiscourages variations from the recommended route, site, volume, or number of doses of any vaccineâ</strong></h2>\n<p>On a call with reporters, Califf said the âoverall safety and efficacy profile [of Jynneos] will not be sacrificedâ with a dose-sparing approach, which <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Real-Anthony-Fauci-Democracy-Childrens/dp/1510766804/ref=sr_1_1\">Dr. Anthony Fauci</a></strong>, chief medical advisor to President Biden, touted as a âpromising solution to the vaccine shortage.â</p>\n<p>According to the CDCâs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html\">best practice guidance</a> for the administration of a vaccine is normally âderived from data from clinical trials, practical experience, normal intervals of health care visits and theoretical considerations.â</p>\n<p>The committee âdiscourages variations from the recommended route, site, volume, or number of doses of any vaccineâ as âvariation from the recommended route and site can result in inadequate protection.â</p>\n<p>The CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html\">website</a> lists numerous examples where the method of administering a vaccine alters <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/immunogenicity\">immunogenicity</a> â the ability of a foreign substance, such as an antigen, to provoke an immune response in the human body.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/14760584.2015.1081067\">paper</a> published in 2015, in the Expert Review of Vaccines assessed the effect of vaccine administration modality on immunogenicity and efficacy.</p>\n<p>The authors found the âroute of delivery can affect the vaccine localization that may influence the priming of immune cells as well as consequential local and systemic immune responses.â</p>\n<p>They went on to say that âthe choice of one strategy over the other depends on the type of vaccine and protective immunity needed to conquer the disease based on the route of infection and transmission.â</p>\n<p>The FDAâs decision to authorize a new route of administration for Jynneos comes less than a week after the Biden administration <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/monkeypox-health-emergency-fda-kids-vaccines/\">declared monkeypox</a> a public health emergency, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization\">allowing</a>Â government health agencies to authorize unapproved medical products or uses of approved medical products to fight the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Many strongly believed that the scourge of narcotics addiction was part and parcel of the governmentâs COINTELPRO project. He was the co-founder and co-director of the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of North America (BAAANA).</p>\n<p>After the rebellions which swept the U.S. during the mid-to-late 1960s spawning the emergence of the organizations such as the Black Panther Party (BPP) and the Republic of New Africa (RNA), the FBI under the direction of the Justice Department along with local and state police departments embarked upon a series of tactics with the strategic goals of neutralizing and liquidating the leadership of revolutionary formations. Although the bulk of documented COINTELPRO operations were launched against the BPP and similar tendencies, the entire African American movement for Civil Rights, Black Power and Socialism fell victim to the machinations of the FBI as well as other spying and destabilizing apparatuses including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Military Intelligence Corps.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of organizers operating in communities throughout the U.S. were arrested, framed and railroaded into prisons. The BPP reported in 1970 that over a period of two years, 28 members of their organization had been killed as a direct result of police and FBI machinations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/nationwide-campaign-seeks-compassionate-release-dr-mutulu-shakur/5789650/detroit-meeting-to-win-compassionate-release-for-dr-mutulu-shakur-aug-5-2022\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5789659\"><img class=\" wp-image-5789659 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Detroit-meeting-to-win-compassionate-release-for-Dr.-Mutulu-Shakur-Aug.-5-2022.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"544\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Detroit-meeting-to-win-compassionate-release-for-Dr.-Mutulu-Shakur-Aug.-5-2022.jpg 960w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Detroit-meeting-to-win-compassionate-release-for-Dr.-Mutulu-Shakur-Aug.-5-2022-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Detroit-meeting-to-win-compassionate-release-for-Dr.-Mutulu-Shakur-Aug.-5-2022-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Detroit-meeting-to-win-compassionate-release-for-Dr.-Mutulu-Shakur-Aug.-5-2022-400x300.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Detroit meeting to win compassionate release for Dr. Mutulu Shakur, Aug. 5, 2022 (Source: Abayomi Azikiwe)</span></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>In March of 1968, the Republic of New Africa was formed in Detroit at the then 20 Grand Club, one of the most popular gathering places on the cityâs westside during the 1950s and 1960s. Initially, the organization brought together a broad spectrum of activists from across the U.S.</p>\n<p>The RNA demanded the creation of a Black Nation encompassing five states in the southern U.S.: Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. The idea was based upon several legal and political arguments which advanced the notion that people of African descent were due reparations for their enslavement and subsequent oppression and exploitation which did not end with the conclusion of the Civil War and the enactment of several constitutional amendments and Civil Rights Acts during the 1860s and 1870s.</p>\n<p>The acquisition of a land mass along with an independent government would serve to compensate and liberate the African American people, labelled âNew Africansâ by the RNA and its subsequent mass organizations. After the formal founding of the RNA, leaders of the organization delivered a document to the U.S. State Department declaring their independence and demanding land to establish a separate Black nation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/republic-new-africa-1968/\">One source wrote</a> on the history of the RNA saying:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âTwo brothers, Milton and Richard Henry, who were associates of Malcolm X, formed an organization called the Malcolm X Society, which was devoted to the creation of an independent Black nation within the United States. Milton and Richard subsequently changed their names to Gaidi Obadele and Imari Abubakari Obadele, respectively. The brothers organized a meeting of 500 Black nationalists in Detroit, Michigan in 1968.Â  Exiled former North Carolina NAACP leader Robert Williams was chosen as the first President of the Republic of New Africa. The group wrote a declaration of independence and established the Republic of New Africa. The group anticipated that the U.S. would reject their demands and made plans for armed resistance and a prolonged guerrilla war.â</p>\n<h2><strong>Mutulu Shakur and the Black Liberation Movement</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr. Shakur has stated in an interview that he was present in Detroit during the first anniversary of the RNA in late March of 1969. A gathering was held at the nationally known New Bethel Baptist Church, pastored at the time by the Rev. C.L. Franklin, the father of legendary vocalists and composers Aretha, Erma and Carolyn Franklin, on March 29 of that year.</p>\n<p>A clash outside the church when the meeting was concluding between two rookie white Detroit police officers and security personnel for the RNA resulted in the death of one officer and the critical wounding of another. Within minutes dozens of police officers invaded the church firing randomly despite the fact that people were still inside the building. Nearly 150 people inside and outside the church were arrested as suspects in the shooting of the police officers.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, then Recorderâs Court Judge George Crockett Jr. accompanied by Rev. Franklin and former State Representative James Del Rio arrived at the detention facilities. Judge Crockett immediately set up court proceedings where those arrested without probable cause were released. The incident fueled the already tense racial situation in Detroit which had been the scene of the largest urban rebellion during late July of 1967.</p>\n<p>Judge Crockett was subjected to an attempted impeachment led by the notorious Detroit Police Officers Association (DPOA) and its supporters in the white community and the corporate press. However, Crockett remained in office while three people who were charged in the shooting were never convicted.</p>\n<p>There were several other armed confrontations involving the RNA, the Black Panther Party and its military wing, the Black Liberation Army (BLA) between 1967 and the early 1980s. Dr. Shakur, a target of the COINTELPRO operations of the federal government, was eventually forced underground while working as an acupuncturist in New York City in 1980.</p>\n<p>He was eventually captured by the FBI in 1986 and prosecuted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1970. The FBI tagged Dr. Shakur as the âringleaderâ of an alliance encompassing the BLA, RNA, the Weather Underground and the May 19 Communist Organization. Due to the political atmosphere in existence in the U.S. during the years of the administration of President Ronald Reagan, he as well as several of his comrades were unable to receive fair trials within the legal system.</p>\n<h2><strong>Nationwide Campaign Demands His Release on Compassionate Grounds</strong></h2>\n<p>Although there was no DNA or independent credible eyewitness evidence linking Dr. Shakur to any of the armed confrontations with law-enforcement agencies, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison in 1988. Under the previous federal sentencing guidelines, he should have been eligible for parole in 2016. All of the other activists captured and charged in the events involving the liberation of BLA member Assata Shakur in 1979, the Brinks robbery in upstate New York in 1981, among other confrontations, have already been released from prison. Only Dr. Shakur remains in federal prison despite his terminal health condition at the age of 72.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mutulushakur.com/\">According to a website</a> advocating for his compassionate release:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âDr. Shakur received his ninth parole denial in January 2021. After being diagnosed with life-threatening bone cancer yet denied compassionate release, his lawsuit against the U.S. Parole Commission and the Bureau of Prisons for unjust denials was expeditedâ¦. The acts of which Dr. Shakur was convicted some thirty years ago were committed in the context of a movement seeking equal opportunities for Black people who, it is widely conceded, were suffering catastrophically from disenfranchisement, segregation, poverty and exclusion from many of the fundamental necessities that make life worth livingâ¦. Dr. Shakur has accepted full responsibility for the acts that resulted in his conviction and for many years has expressed the deepest remorse for those who were killed and their families pleading that there is no justification for the loss of life for the victims. For over twenty-five years, Dr. Shakur has been a leading voice in the Black community calling for peace, reconciliation and healing for the countless lives lost in pursuit of basic justice and human rights.â</p>\n<p>Organizers are continuing their work aimed at winning compassionate release. Appeals are being made to U.S. Congressional lawmakers and President Joe Biden. An educational campaign is underway to inform the public about the plight of Dr. Shakur and the need for his immediate release. Anyone interested in getting involved with these efforts can log on <a href=\"https://mutulushakur.com/\">here</a>Â in order to sign the petition and obtain detailed information on his medical and legal status.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

On the day his company issued its press release on the proposed vaccine trials, he sold 62% of his stock in Pfizer, making millions profit in the deal. <strong>He made the sell order in a special option in August so it would not appear as âinsider sellingâ</strong>, however he also timed it just after the US elections and the mainstream media illegitimately declared Joe Biden President-elect. It seems from appearances that Bourla had a pretty clear conflict of interest in the timing of his press release on the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pfizer-ceo-sold-stock-day-covid-19-vaccine-results-unveiled-2020-11-1029790705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same day</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Bourla lied and denied to the Press that his company had received any funds from the Trump Administration to develop the vaccine when it came out they contracted in summer to deliver 100 million doses to the US Government. Further adding to the suspect actions of Pfizer was the fact the company first informed the team of<strong> Joe biden</strong> rather than the relevant US government agencies.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">But this is far from the only thing alarming about the much-hyped Pfizer announcement. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">The German Partner</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Pfizer, famous for its Viagra and other drugs, has partnered with a small Mainz, Germany company, <strong>BioNTech</strong>, which has developed the radical mRNA technique used to produce the new corona vaccine. BioNTech was only founded in 2008. BioNTech signed an agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in September, 2019, just before announcement in Wuhan China of the Novel Coronavirus and just before BioNTech made its stock market debut. The agreement involved cooperation on developing new mRNA techniques to treat cancer and HIV. Curiously that press release, âThe Gates Foundation sees BioNTech potential to âdramatically reduce global HIV and tuberculosisââ 05. September 2019, has now been deleted.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BioNTech also has an agreement with one of the largest drug producers in China, <strong>Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd</strong> (âFosun Pharmaâ) to develop a version of its mRNA vaccine for novel coronavirus for the Chinese market. <strong>Ai-Min Hui,</strong> President of Global R&amp;D of Fosun Pharma said in an August statement, âDosing the first Chinese subject with BNT162b1 marks a milestone of the global co-development program in China. We are closely working with BioNTech and regulatory authorities to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BNT162b1 and other mRNA <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/05/2073035/0/en/BioNTech-and-Fosun-Pharma-Announce-Start-of-Clinical-Trial-of-mRNA-based-COVID-19-Vaccine-Candidate-in-China.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vaccine candidates</a>â¦â</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">T<strong>his means that the same German biotech company is behind the covid vaccines being rushed out in China as well as the USA and EU.</strong> The vaccine is being rushed through to eventual approval in an alarmingly short time. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Both US and EU authorities and presumably also Chinese, waived the standard animal tests using ferrets or mice and have gone straight to human âguinea pigs.â Human tests began in late July and early August. Three months is unheard of for testing a new vaccine. Several years is the norm. Because of the degree of global panic engendered by WHO over the coronavirus, caution is thrown to the wind. Vaccine makers all have legal indemnity, meaning they canât be sued if people die or are maimed from the new vaccine. But the most alarming fact about the new Pfizer-BioNTech gene edited vaccine is that the gene edited mRNA for human vaccine application has never before been approved. Notably, two year peer reviewed tests with mice fed genetically modified corn sprayed with Monsanto glyphosate-rich Roundup first showed cancer tumors after nine months as well as liver and other organ damage. Earlier Monsanto company tests ended at three months and <a href=\"https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">claimed no harm</a>.Â </span><span lang=\"en-US\">A similar situation exists with the gene edited mRNA vaccines that are being rushed out after less than 90 days human tests.</span></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><strong>â<span lang=\"en-US\">Explicitly experimentalâ</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Dr. Michael Yeadon</strong> replied in a recent public social media comment to a colleague in the UK; Â âAll vaccines against the SARS-COV-2 virus are by definition novel. No candidate vaccine has beenâ¦ in development for more than a few months.â Yeadon then went on to declare, </span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">âIf any such vaccine is approved for use under any circumstances that are not EXPLICITLY experimental, I believe that recipients are being misled to a criminal extent. This is because there are precisely zero human volunteers forâ¦whom there could possibly be more than a few months past-dose safety <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1302725167588798467.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">information</a>.â</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Yeadon is well qualified to make the critique. As he notes in the comment, âI have a degree in Biochemistry &amp; Toxicology &amp; a research based PhD in pharmacology. I have spent 32 years working in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, mostly in new medicines for disorders of lung &amp; skin. I was a VP at Pfizer &amp; CEOâ¦. of a biotech I founded (Ziarco â acquired by Novartis). Iâm <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1302725167588798467.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">knowledgeable</a>Â about new medicine R&amp;D.â </span><span lang=\"en-US\">He was formerly with Pfizer at a very senior level. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Human guinea pigs?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is experimental and far from guaranteed safe, despite the fact that Pfizer, the EU and the notorious Dr Tony Fauci seem ready to roll it out even before year end to hundreds of millions of humans. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The experimental technology is based on a rather new gene manipulation known as gene editing. In a major article in the 2018 New York Council on Foreign Relations magazine, </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Foreign Affairs</span><span lang=\"en-US\">, Bill Gates effusively promoted the novel gene editing CRISPR technology as being able to âtransform global development.â He noted that his Gates Foundation had been financing gene editing developments for vaccines and other <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-04-10/gene-editing-good?cid=nlc-fa_fatoday-20180601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">applications for a decade</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">But is the technology for breaking and splicing of human genes so absolutely safe that it is worth risking on a novel experimental vaccine never before used on humans? Contrary to what Bill Gates claims, the scientific answer is no, it is not proven so safe. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In a peer reviewed article in the October, 2020 journal </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Trends in Genetics</span><span lang=\"en-US\">, the authors conclude that âthe range of possible molecular events resulting from genome editing has been underestimated and the technology remains unpredictable on, and away from, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016895252030247X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target locus</a>.â</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Dr. Romeo Quijano</strong>, retired professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the College of Medicine, University of the Philippines Manila, noted some of the dangers of the experimental gene editing when applied to human vaccines. Quijano warns of, </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"en-US\">âthe danger that the vaccine might actually âenhanceâ the pathogenicity of the virus, or make it more aggressive possibly due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), as what happened with previous studies on test vaccines in animals. If that should happen in a major human trial the outcome could be disastrous. This serious adverse effect may not even be detected by a clinical trial especially in highly biased clinical trials laden with conflicts of interest involving vaccine companies. Even when a serious adverse event is detected, this is usually swept under the rug.â</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"> He cites the case of another Gates mRNA vaccine candidate, Moderna, where âthree of the 15 human experimental subjects in the high dose group suffered serious and medically significant symptoms. Moderna, however, concluded that the vaccine was âgenerally safe and well tolerated,â which the corporate-dominated media dutifully reported, covering-up the <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2020/08/21/hazards-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">real danger</a>â¦â</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">He notes, </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"en-US\">âExogenous mRNA is inherently immune-stimulatory, and this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It may provide adjuvant activity and it may inhibit antigen expression and negatively affect the immune response. The paradoxical effects of innate immune sensing on different formats of mRNA vaccines are incompletely understood.â Quijano adds, âA mRNA-based vaccine could also induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunityâ¦ and may promote blood coagulation and pathological <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2020/08/21/hazards-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thrombus formation</a>.â</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Quijano writes in the extensively documented article, </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span lang=\"en-US\">âamong other dangers, the virus-vectored vaccines could undergo recombination with naturally occurring viruses and produce hybrid viruses that could have undesirable properties affecting transmission or virulence. Theâ¦possible outcomes of recombination are practically impossible to quantify accurately given existing tools and knowledge. The risks, however, are real, as exemplified by the emergence of mutant types of viruses, enhanced pathogenicity and unexpected serious adverse events (including death) following haphazard mass vaccination campaigns and previous failed attempts to develop chimeric vaccines using <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2020/08/21/hazards-of-the-covid-19-vaccine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genetic engineering technology</a>.â</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\"><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr..jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-5599627\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr..jpg 590w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr.-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr.-400x266.jpg 400w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Robert-Kennedy-Jr.-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\"></a>Bill Gates, the mRNA vaccine makers including Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and their close allies such as<strong> Dr. Tony Fauci</strong> of the NIAID are clearly playing fast and loose with human lives in their rush to get these experimental vaccines into our bodies. Notably, the same Dr. Fauci and his NIAID owns the patent on a vaccine for dengue fever known as Dengvaxia, marketed by Sanofi-Pasteur and promoted as an âessentialâ vaccine by Tedrosâ WHO since 2016. <strong>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</strong>Â (right) noted that Fauci and NIAID âknew from the clinical trials that there was a problem with paradoxical immune response,â but they gave it to several hundred thousand Filipino kids anyway. It was estimated that as many as 600 vaccinated children died before the government stopped the <a href=\"https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/05/joseph-mercola/the-well-known-hazards-of-coronavirus-vaccines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vaccinations</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Clearly the well-established Precautionary Principleâif in serious doubt, donâtâ is being ignored by Fauci, Pfizer/BioNTech and others in rushing to approve the new mRNA vaccine for coronavirus. Messenger RNA technology has yet to produce an approved medicine, let alone a vaccine.</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

That interpretation of events has since been vindicated in hindsight by Shermanâs latest statement, which also follows New Zealandâs participation in the US-led âPartners in the Blue Pacificâ (PBP) bloc for containing China in the South Pacific. That newly established structure is basically <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2022-06-26/-Partners-in-the-Blue-Pacific-is-really-just-AUKUS-Plus-1baYFphsQbS/index.html\">AUKUS+</a> since it includes the first-mentionedâs three members alongside Japan and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>This observation as well as Shermanâs statement of intent very strongly suggests that New Zealand will probably be the next member of AUKUS.</p>\n<p>It also extends credence to the prediction that Japan will likely follow in its footsteps too, thus leading to the northern and southern expansions of the so-called âAsian NATOâ.</p>\n<p>Other prospective members include the USâ Philippine mutual defense partners who Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently pledged to â<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/06/asia/us-defend-philippines-south-china-sea-blinken-hnk-intl/index.html\">defend</a>â from China in the South China Sea during his trip to Manilla last weekend. As for South Korea, despite its new conservative leadershipâs philo-Americanism, it remains unclear whether Seoul will formally or even only informally join AUKUS+.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>In any case, this blocâs likely expansion to New Zealand in the coming future confirms prior criticisms from multipolar countries that itâs a regional variant of NATO intended to contain China just like its inspiration attempts to do to Russia. The larger pattern at play is that the US is seeking to replicate the structural model that it employed in the Old Cold War in Europe against the erstwhile USSR in the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220730193808/https:/oneworld.press/?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;id=2628\">New Cold War</a> against China after having recently rejuvenated NATO following Moscowâs <a href=\"https://russiancouncil.ru/en/analytics-and-comments/columns/military-and-security/why-did-u-s-prioritize-containing-russia-over-china/\">special</a> <a href=\"https://astutenews.com/2022/03/russia-is-waging-an-existential-struggle-in-defense-of-its-independence-sovereignty/\">military</a> <a href=\"http://zububrothers.com/2022/05/16/15-explanations-for-the-slow-but-steady-pace-of-russias-special-military-operation/\">operation</a> in Ukraine that none other than Washington itself <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/the-kremlin-spokesman-is-correct\">provoked</a>. The discussion about New Zealandâs prospective membership in AUKUS is also coming at a unique time for the USâ âPivot to Asiaâ.</p>\n<p>US Speaker Nancy Pelosi just stirred up trouble with the Peopleâs Republic through her latest trip to Taiwan, which was arguably intended to artificially manufacture the pretext for resuming the prioritization of her declining unipolar hegemonâs anti-Chinese containment policy. As the author <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/whyd-china-let-pelosi-land-on-taiwan\">analyzed last week</a>, the unexpected timing of this development after so many observers thought that it wouldnât take place again until sometime (perhaps far) later in the future due to the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220628000554/https:/oneworld.press/?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;id=2783\">US-led NATO proxy war on Russia through Ukraine</a> is occurring precisely because that aforementioned proxy war has failed to achieve its grand strategic goals.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg dealt a major soft power blow to the US by <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/bloombergs-acknowledgement-of-russian\">acknowledging</a> Russiaâs strategic gains in Africa and <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/bloomberg-shouldnt-be-shocked-that\">admitting</a> that only half of the G20 complied with Americaâs demands for them to sanction Moscow, which proves that itâs <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/lavrovs-latest-tour-proved-that-russia\">far from isolated</a>. Other Mainstream Media (MSM) outlets also recently released damning reports that decisively shifted the official narrative about the Ukrainian Conflict and what itâs supposedly achieved vis a vis Russia. <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/pro-kiev-trolls-are-triggered-by\">Amnesty International</a> proved that Kiev is illegally militarizing residential areas and thus exploiting civilians there as human shields while <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/cbs-news-warned-that-western-weapons\">CBS News</a> warned that Western weapons sent to Kiev might end up in terroristsâ hands.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/the-guardians-report-about-the-mozart\">The Guardian</a>, meanwhile, criticized the extremely low level of military training that Kievâs forces have received up until this point. That was then followed by <a href=\"https://korybko.substack.com/p/cnn-just-admitted-that-the-global\">CNN</a>admitting that the global food crisis isnât entirely due to the Ukrainian Conflict unlike what was previously claimed by US officials. Norwegian academic Glenn Diesen also picked up on the MSMâs signals to ask in his latest article, â<a href=\"https://www.rt.com/russia/560533-zelensky-ukraine-kiev-us/\">As the tide turns in Ukraine, is the US preparing to throw Zelensky under the bus?</a>â Regardless of how long it takes for that prospective scenario to play out, it certainly seems like the writing is already on the wall, to which end it naturally follows that the US is actively preparing to resume its âPivot to Asiaâ to contain China.</p>\n<p>These background dynamics help make better sense of the timing of Shermanâs statement related to New Zealandâs possible membership in AUKUS. The geostrategic pieces are all falling into place one after another to create the compelling impression that the US-led NATO proxy war on Russia through Ukraine has failed to achieve the grand strategic goals that were expected of it, which is why Washington is now willing to speed up the inevitable resumption of its âPivot to Asiaâ in response instead of waiting at least several years like many observers expected. Expressing public interest in formally expanding AUKUS is most likely meant to signal to the Asia-Pacific that the aforementioned assessment is indeed accurate.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll of course take time for the US to reorient its grand strategic focus back to that region after abruptly prioritizing the containment of Russia upon provoking its special military operation in Ukraine, but there shouldnât be any doubt that everything is moving in this direction. AUKUS might also not expand right away, whether through New Zealand becoming its next member or whoever else, but that too appears to be a fait accompli considering the larger trends at play. While this insight bodes negatively for China, it nevertheless suggests to Russia that some relief from the unprecedented US-led Western containment campaign might eventually be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The news initially sparked widespread media attention, but in the end it came and went with relatively little fanfare, especially for the death of a long-time American enemy with a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286\">$25 million bounty</a> on his head.</em></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most telling aspect of the announcement (and the discourse that followed) was what was left unsaid. Despite the fact that Biden ran for president in part on restoring the ârules-based international order,â he made no effort to justify the attack under international law, and most news coverage has failed to even touch on the issue.</p>\r\n<p>On the surface, the strike left relatively little to complain about. It was remarkably precise, killing only Zawahiri, and, for many analysts, it <a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/08/01/al-zawahiri-killing-shows-over-the-horizon-counterterrorism-can-work/\">proved</a> that Americaâs withdrawal from Afghanistan would not hinder its ability to conduct precise counter terror missions.</p>\r\n<p>But experts say the killing lacks legal justification and shows that Biden has bought into one of the most pernicious ideas driving the past two decades of U.S. policy: Washington can and should use force wherever it sees fit, even if that means twisting international law beyond recognition. This is in many ways the underlying logic for Americaâs globe-spanning military presence, according to experts who spoke with Responsible Statecraft. Worse, it erodes international law, allowing other states to justify all sorts of questionable actions outside their borders.</p>\r\n<p>As Russiaâs illegal war on Ukraine enters its sixth month, international law has seldom been more important, according to Craig Martin, a professor at Washburn University.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âWe say itâs an act of aggression. We allege that theyâre committing war crimes. Weâre up in arms,â Martin said. âBut you canât argue that Russia is somehow in violation of this international law â and that they should be held accountable for it â if you yourself are not willing to comply with that international law.â</p>\r\n<p>Neither the White House nor the Pentagon responded to questions from Responsible Statecraft about their legal justification for the strike. In fact, U.S. officials have not yet offered a public justification for the attack. On the domestic front, the administration could point to the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force against al-Qaida, which provides a strong case under U.S. law.</p>\r\n<p>The logic is less clear-cut when it comes to international law. Legal scholars who spoke to Responsible Statecraft say that Bidenâs team would likely argue that it was an act of self defense and that America had the right to violate Afghanistanâs sovereignty because the Taliban is âunwilling or unableâ to help stop the threat posed by Zawahiri. (<strong>Secretary of State Antony Blinken</strong> <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/the-death-of-ayman-al-zawahiri/\">may have alluded</a> to this idea in his speech after the strike in which he pointed to the âTalibanâs unwillingness or inability to abide by their commitments.â) Charles Dunlap, a Duke law professor who previously served as an attorney for the Air Force, <a href=\"https://sites.duke.edu/lawfire/2022/08/03/law-and-the-ayman-al-zawahiri-airstrike-a-dozen-qs-as/\">argued</a>Â in a blog post that this is enough to justify the strike under international law.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âSuch facts seem sufficient, even in the absence of evidence about a specific forthcoming attack, to find that al-Zawahiri represented a threat that met the criteria for the application of anticipatory self-defense,â Dunlap wrote. â[T]he presence of al-Zawahiri living openly in Kabul showed that the Taliban was âunwilling or unableâ to address the threat he posed to the âsecurity of other countries.ââ</p>\r\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\">Â </div>\r\n<p>In Lawfare, national security law expert Robert Chesney <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/legality-strike-killed-ayman-al-zawahiri\">noted</a> that this concept has long held sway among U.S. officials, adding that â[t]hereâs little doubt that the âunwillingâ condition applies here.â</p>\r\n<p>But much of the international legal community is skeptical of this theory, with only a few countries <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/which-states-support-unwilling-and-unable-test\">accepting</a> it as plausible. As legal expert Adil Haque told Responsible Statecraft, it also relies on the questionable assumption that America and al-Qaida are still at war.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âAnytime armed hostilities between the state and a non-state actor fall below a certain minimum threshold of intensity, the armed conflict temporarily pauses and the law of armed conflict no longer applies,â argues Haque, who teaches law at Rutgers University. âThereâs a very plausible argument that thatâs where the United States and al-Qaida have been for some time, while Al Qaeda really has not been carrying out attacks against U.S. targets on a kind of regular basis.â</p>\r\n<p>And Haque is not alone in this assessment. As Martin noted, the United Nations Security Council recently <a href=\"https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/S%202022%20547.pdf\">reported</a> that, while terror groups still create major issues in conflict-ridden countries, al-Qaida âis not viewed as posing an immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan.â</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Questions left unanswered</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Zawahiriâs death falls under the category of âtargeted killing,â a somewhat euphemistic term that the military insists is different from assassination. Prior to 9/11, Israel was the only country that frequently engaged in the practice, which American leaders <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/powell-criticizes-targeted-killings/\">opposed</a>. But the Global War on Terror changed the calculus in Washington, and the U.S. military <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/08/13/targeted-killings-a-short-history/\">adopted</a> the tactic starting in 2002.</p>\r\n<p>The practice is controversial for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that attacks are rarely as âtargetedâ as last weekâs was. In one previous attempt to take out Zawahiri, the U.S. military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/15/alqaida.pakistan\">killed</a> at least 18 Pakistani civilians. (A second <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/30/AR2006103000176.html?nav=rss_world\">strike</a> that may have targeted the al-Qaida leader killed as many as 80 civilians, many of whom were children.) And this level of âcollateral damageâ is more common than people like to think. Take the case of Qasim Al-Raymi: The United States took out the former leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula in 2020 after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/yemen-dirty-war-ap-top-news-al-qaida-international-news-jamal-khashoggi-9051691c8f8a449e8bb6fd684f100863\">killing</a>Â 66 people, including 31 children, in two prior attempts.</p>\r\n<p>For international legal scholars, this type of attack is complicated. Though it can be legal under certain circumstances, most experts say the state carrying out the strike has to prove that it is at war with the group and that the person targeted poses an imminent threat to its security. In other words, itâs not enough to be a <em>member</em> of al-Qaida in order to be killed; the target has to be engaged in planning or carrying out actual attacks. And when it comes to the 71-year-old Zawahiri, <a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/08/02/the-us-killing-of-zawahiri-was-more-retribution-than-prevention/\">this was far from clear</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the CIA â not the military â carried out the strike on Zawahiri, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/01/sources-u-s-kills-al-qaeda-leader-ayman-al-zawahri-in-drone-strike-00049089\">according to</a> U.S. officials. While Washington has long blurred the line between the CIA and the Pentagon, legal experts contend that intelligence officials cannot legally engage in war under any circumstances given that theyâre not uniformed combatants.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âThey donât get to kill people in war, at least not with immunity,â said Martin, noting that domestic Afghan law would likely apply in this case.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps of greater concern is the question of sovereignty, the bedrock of international law. Notably, the United States is no longer at war in Afghanistan with the permission of the Afghan government, and it has made no indication that the Taliban gave an authorization for the strike. In such a case, Washington generally relies on the previously mentioned âââunwilling or unableâ theory. But Martin contends that this would require U.S. officials to actually seek permission from the Taliban, which seems not to have happened in this case. (The White House did not respond when asked if the U.S. spoke to Afghan officials prior to the strike.)</p>\r\n<p>Policymakers might argue that this is unnecessary given that, by harboring terrorists, the Taliban has violated its 2020 accord with the United States. But that assertion is hard to scrutinize given that the pact has still not been made public.</p>\r\n<p>And all of this relies on another dubious assumption: Namely, that the âbattlefieldâ for war with al-Qaida includes anywhere a member of the group can be found â including an apartment in a crowded city where the United States is not at war.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âIf the United States had fired a drone through a street in Paris to kill Zawahiri, there would be a much different conversation, right?â Martin asked. âYou would intuitively say âno, surely the battlefield is not in France.â But that is one of the implications of this idea that thereâs this global armed conflict with which the battlefield is defined by wherever al-Qaida members happen to go.â</p>\r\n<p>As with domestic law, the international system loses legitimacy and effectiveness when powerful players bend the rule of law to their whim. Other countries have already used Americaâs arguments to justify questionable attacks, including Turkey, which has <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/08/turkeys-targeted-killings-signal-new-strategy-against-syrian-kurdish-forces\">targeted</a> Kurdish <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-713373\">leaders</a> in Iraq and Syria. (âTurkey is essentially using the same legal rationale,â said Haque. âItâs very difficult to distinguish the two cases.â) And this will only get worse if Washington continues to flout international law at will, according to Samuel Moyn, a professor at Yale University and a non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âIn general, the United States has treated the law of self defense as always permissive for whatever it wants to do,â argued Moyn. âAnd so why wouldnât other states follow suit?â</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, itâs not too late for Washington to change its tune. With the threat from al-Qaida at an ebb, officials could start approaching counter terror as a question of law enforcement rather than war and encourage other states to do the same. But, in order to move on from two decades of hollowing out international law, the U.S. foreign policy community will need to get back to a question that has never been properly addressed since 9/11.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âIs it really true that this kind of illegal act is the only way of dealing with the threat?â asked Moyn. âIf you say no, then your incentive is to figure out what a better regime looks like.â</p>\r\n<p>*</p>\r\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

For the arms contractors making a killing, itâs win-win; this is a war they cannot lose.â</p>\n<p>It is mere realism to observe how fantastically lucrative the ongoing war is proving to be for US-based weapons dealersâand a longer war means still more huge profits, said Solomon, author ofÂ <em>âWar Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death</em>â.</p>\n<p>He said the recent news reports that the White House is âexploringâ whether to ship fighter jets to Ukraine is a further indication that the US administration is in the midst of extremely dangerous mission creep.</p>\n<p>Back on March 11, President Biden declared that sending jets with US pilots and crews to Ukraine would amount to âWorld War III.â</p>\n<p>Yet, he is now reportedly considering a big step in that direction. Instead of more massive shipments of weaponry, whatâs desperately needed is a commitment to leave no stone unturned on behalf of finding diplomatic solutions that can end this war, said Solomon.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the State Department says the United States is committed to strengthening allies and partners worldwide to meet their sovereign self-defense needs and to improve their capabilities to operate with US forces to address shared security challenges.</p>\n<p>The DepartmentâsÂ <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-arms-control-and-international-security-affairs/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/\">Bureau of Political-Military Affairs</a>Â oversees most government-to-government arms transfers and commercial export licensing of U.S.-origin defense equipment and technologies, consistent with theÂ <a href=\"https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&amp;sys_id=b9a933addb7c930044f9ff621f961932\">Arms Export Control Act</a>, the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, theÂ <a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-75/pdf/STATUTE-75-Pg424-2.pdf\">Foreign Assistance Act of 1961</a>, theÂ <a href=\"https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&amp;sys_id=%2024d528fddbfc930044f9ff621f961987\">International Traffic in Arms Regulations</a>, and other statutory authorities and relevant international agreements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, according to the July 22 State Department Fact Sheet, US weapons to Ukraine also included:</p>\n\nPuma Unmanned Aerial Systems;\nUnmanned Coastal Defense Vessels;\n26 counter-artillery radars;\nFour counter-mortar radars;\nFour air surveillance radars;\nTwo harpoon coastal defense systems;\n18 coastal and riverine patrol boats;\nM18A1 Claymore anti-personnel munitions;\nC-4 explosives, demolition munitions, and demolition equipment for obstacle clearing;\nTactical secure communications systems;\nThousands of night vision devices, thermal imagery systems, optics, and laser rangefinders;\nCommercial satellite imagery services;\nExplosive ordnance disposal protective gear;\nChemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear protective equipment;\nMedical supplies to include first aid kits;\nElectronic jamming equipment;\nField equipment and spare parts;\nFunding for training, maintenance, and sustainment.\n\n<p>The United States also continues to work with its allies and partners to provide Ukraine with additional capabilities to defend itself.</p>\n<p>According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Russian Federationâs military and paramilitary services are equipped mostly with domestically-produced weapons systems, although since 2010, Russia has imported limited amounts of military hardware from several countries, including Czechia, France, Israel, Italy, Turkey, and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The Russian defense industry is also capable of designing, developing, and producing a full range of advanced air, land, missile, and naval systems. As of 2021, Russia is the worldâs second largest exporter of military hardware.</p>\n<p>The Russian armed forces include approximately 850,000 total active-duty troops (300,000 Ground Troops; 40,000 Airborne Troops; 150,000 Navy; 160,000 Aerospace Forces; 70,000 Strategic Rocket Forces; approximately 20,000 special operations forces; approximately 100,000 other uniformed personnel (command and control, cyber, support, logistics, security, etc.); estimated 200-250,000 Federal National Guard Troops.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

And one module contained only narrative summaries of Modernaâs studies, but no actual study results.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âSo we are still missing a large number of results, such as full reports that are supporting those narratives,â Latypova told Kennedy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The FDA âobviously did not objectâ to any of this, she said. âThatâs <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-moderna-bypass-covid-vaccine-safety-standards-documents/\">evidence of collusion</a> to me with the manufacturer.â</p>\n<p>Latypova also discussed Modernaâs clinical trials timeline. She said the Investigational New Drug (IND) application meeting is supposed to occur with the FDA when the company initiates human clinical trials.</p>\n<p>Moderna and the FDA had a pre-IND meeting on Feb. 19, 2020, and the IND application was formally opened the next day. The global pandemic was declared on March 11, 2020.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âSomehow these visionaries could predict the future with such certainty that they opened a clinical trial for the vaccine, for which a pandemic was announced a month later,â Latypova said.</p>\n<p>There is normally only one IND application for one product. In this case, however, there are two IND applications â one belonging to Moderna, and one belonging to the National Institutes of Health, which <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moderna-covid-vaccine-patent-dispute-national-institutes-health/\">partnered</a> with Moderna on its COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n<p>Latypova also told Kennedy that Moderna did not conduct studies to determine if its mRNA vaccine affected male fertility.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âWe have no idea what [the vaccine] does to young men who want to have children in the future,â she said.</p>\n<p>The documents also confirm that Modernaâs trials studied the vaccineâs delivery mechanism, but not its payload, which in this case is the <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccine-spike-protein-travels-from-injection-site-organ-damage/\">spike protein</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âThey want you to believe that â¦ you can â¦ have a truck filled with food, or you can have a truck filled with explosives,â Latypova said. âTheyâre saying it doesnât matter. Focus on the truck. Itâs the same truck, doesnât matter whatâs inside.â</p>\n<p>In the end, Latypova said,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">âTheyâre desperate to vaccinate every single person on the planet because they donât want you to know whatâs going on.â</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/moderna-clinical-trials-flawed-fda-pharma-executive-alexandra-latypova-rfk-jr-podcast/\">Watch the episode here</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Pelosiâs trip coincided with US efforts to convince TSMC â the worldâs largest chip manufacturer, on which the US is heavily dependent â to establish a manufacturing base in the US and to stop making advanced chips for Chinese companies.</em></p>\n<p>US support for Taiwan has historically been based on Washingtonâs opposition to communist rule in Beijing, and Taiwanâs resistance to absorption by China. But in recent years, Taiwanâs autonomy has become a vital geopolitical interest for the US because of the <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/26/trendforce_foundry_capacity/#:%7E:text=Taiwan%20dominates%20the%20world\'s%20semiconductor,to%20market%20intelligence%20firm%20TrendForce.\">islandâs dominance</a> of the semiconductor manufacturing market.</p>\n<p>Semiconductors â also known as computer chips or just chips â are integral to all the networked devices that have become embedded into our lives. They also have advanced military applications.</p>\n<p>Transformational, super-fast 5G internet is enabling a world of connected devices of every kind (the â<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/internet-of-things-1724\">Internet of Things</a>â) and a new generation of networked weapons. With this in mind, US officials began to realise during the Trump administration that US semiconductor design companies, such as Intel, were heavily dependent on Asian-based supply chains for the manufacturing of their products.</p>\n<p>In particular, Taiwanâs position in the world of semiconductor manufacturing is a bit like Saudi Arabiaâs status in OPEC. TSMC has <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf\">a 53% market share</a> of the global foundry market (factories contracted to make chips designed in other countries). Other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>As a result, the Biden administrationâs <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf\">100-Day Supply Chain Review Report</a> says, âThe United States is heavily dependent on a single company â TSMC â for producing its leading-edge chips.â The fact that only TSMC and Samsung (South Korea) can make the most advanced semiconductors (five nanometres in size) âputs at risk the ability to supply current and future [US] national security and critical infrastructure needsâ .</p>\n<p>This means that Chinaâs long-term goal of reunifying with Taiwan is now more threatening to US interests. <strong>In the 1972 Shanghai Communique and the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the US recognised that people in both mainland China and Taiwan believed that there was âOne Chinaâ</strong> and that they both belonged to it. But for the US it is unthinkable that TSMC could one day be in territory controlled by Beijing.</p>\n<h2><strong>âTech warâ</strong></h2>\n<p>For this reason, the US has been trying to attract TSMC to the US to increase domestic chip production capacity. In 2021, with the support of the Biden administration, the company bought a site in Arizona on which to build a US foundry. This is scheduled to be completed in 2024.</p>\n<p>The US Congress has just passed the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-08-01/chips-and-science-act-could-become-a-280-billion-boondoggle\">Chips and Science Act</a>, which provides US$52 billion (Â£43 billion) in subsidies to support semiconductor manufacturing in the US. But companies will only receive Chips Act funding if they agree not to manufacture advanced semiconductors for Chinese companies.</p>\n<p>This means that TSMC and others may well have to choose between doing business in China and in the US because the cost of manufacturing in the US is deemed to be too high without government subsidies.</p>\n<p>This is all part of a broader âtech warâ between the US and China, in which the US is aiming to constrain Chinaâs technological development and prevent it from exercising a global tech leadership role.</p>\n<p>In 2020, the Trump administration imposed <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/us-boosts-sanctions-for-china-tech-giant-huawei/a-54599763\">crushing sanctions</a>Â on the Chinese tech giant Huawei that were designed to cut the company off from TSMC, on which it was reliant for the production of high-end semiconductors needed for its 5G infrastructure business.</p>\n<p>Huawei was the worldâs leading supplier of 5G network equipment but the <a href=\"https://2017-2021.state.gov/huawei-and-its-siblings-the-chinese-tech-giants-national-security-and-foreign-policy-implications/index.html\">US feared</a> its Chinese origins posed a security risk (though this claim has been <a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/myths-and-realities-of-chinas-military-civil-fusion-strategy\">questioned</a>). The sanctions are still in place because both Republicans and Democrats want to stop other countries from using Huaweiâs 5G equipment.</p>\n<p>The British government had initially decided to use Huawei equipment in certain parts of the UKâs 5G network. The Trump administrationâs sanctions forced London to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-huawei-idUSKCN24E30P\">reverse that decision</a>.</p>\n<p>A key US goal appears to be ending its dependency on supply chains in China or Taiwan for âemerging and foundational technologiesâ, which includes advanced semiconductors needed for 5G systems, but may include other advanced tech in future.</p>\n<p>Pelosiâs trip to Taiwan was about more than just Taiwanâs critical place in the âtech warâ. But the dominance of its most important company has given the island a new and critical geopolitical importance that is likely to heighten existing tensions between the US and China over the status of the island. It has also intensified US efforts to âreshoreâ its semiconductor supply chain.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The CIA is launching a new project aimed at fomenting actions against Beijing. For this, the US government is even shifting money that was aimed at investing in measures against terrorism. In practice, this means that tensions between Washington and Beijing are likely to remain serious for a long time to come.</em></p>\n<p>Recently, the Associated Press reported, citing sources, that the CIA&#8217;s &#8220;counterterrorism&#8221; mission center is having its budget and personnel redirected to a new center, which would be focused on China. The sources report that, although terrorism remains a &#8220;priority&#8221; for the agency, China is currently considered the greatest threat to the US, which is why more efforts would be needed in order to create measures aimed at neutralizing the Asian country.</p>\n<p>The news comes a few days after the US carried out a military intelligence operation that killed <strong>Ayman al-Zawahri</strong>, an alleged leader of Al Qaeda, in Kabul. As the operation took place, China intensified its military exercises in the Taiwan Strait, forming an air and naval blockade against the island. American experts allegedly suggested that this fact proved that terrorism, while still a problem, is no longer the top American priority, as Beijing is taking advantage of the time spent on &#8220;counterterrorism&#8221; by the Americans to further advance its ambitions. This &#8220;new situation&#8221; would justify a change of focus on the part of American intelligence.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Douglas Wise</strong>, a former CIA officer who worked at the counter-terrorism center, commented on the case and assessed that the transition will not be so easy, since over the last few decades the US has devoted much of its intelligence apparatus to the terrorism issue. Wise believes that an anti-terrorist &#8220;culture&#8221; has been developed at the CIA, which will take years to overcome by a new focus. He stressed that a &#8220;rational plan&#8221; for transition will be needed, otherwise US intelligence will be stagnant and without operational capability, which will undoubtedly favor US enemies.</p>\n<p>It is necessary to point out, however, that the news is not as surprising as it seems at first. The US has been promoting an intelligence focus to an &#8220;anti-China mission&#8221; since last year, when, in October, the CIA announced the creation of an operations center against China. What seems to be happening now is simply the officialization of this new focus of attention, in addition to budget and human resources redirection. China will officially become Americans&#8217; greatest fear and Washington&#8217;s national security priority.</p>\n<p>Also, the creation of this new anti-China intelligence center, even more specialized and equipped than the previous one, seems to be a direct consequence of Biden&#8217;s foreign policy program, which proposed to simply confront all &#8220;enemy&#8221; countries at the same time, escalating tensions around the world. While Trump has steered opposition to Beijing towards a commercial focus provoking a âtrade warâ Biden has intensified the confrontation in the military and intelligence field, which has put the world at risk.</p>\n<p>What remains to be seen is what data would justify this assessment about the existence of a &#8220;Chinese threat&#8221;. The intensification of Chinese military activities in recent days came as a response to an American provocation. If the US had not sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei, China would not have started the current drills. There seems to be no point in considering Beijing a threat for responding to a provocation that the US itself made.</p>\n<p>Obviously, both countries have a number of disagreements and can undoubtedly be considered rival states, but it does not seem prudent in any way to direct this opposition to an intelligence aspect. This makes the situation more serious and sets precedents for an endless chain of countermeasures. If US intelligence has China as its focus, Chinese intelligence will also be forced to have the US as its main target. And so, the tensions only tend to increase.</p>\n<p>It is also necessary to note that terrorism has been considered the main global threat over the last decades. Combating terrorism is a national security priority in almost every state. The possibility of replacing the importance of combating this global enemy with combating one specific country is something truly outrageous and reason enough to escalate tensions even further.</p>\n<p>The best measure the US could take with regard to China would be to simply stop provoking the Asian country and allow its process of national reunification to take place in the most peaceful and sovereign way possible. The less American interference in Chinese affairs, the more peacefully tensions will be resolved.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
