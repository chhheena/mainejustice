The plane that Wray was in such a hurry for ended up being the FBI&#8217;s luxury Gulfstream 550 jet that took him to the Adirondacks, where his family has a summer home.</p>\n<p>During Wray&#8217;s testimony, which was very disingenuous, he avoided questions from both Democrats and Republicans who pressed him about the FBI&#8217;s mishandling of the case of Larry Nassar, who was convicted in 2016 of sexually abusing US gymnasts. Wray was also asked why he didn&#8217;t fire one of the agents involved in the botched case until 2021.</p>\n<div id=\"ld-8276-1099\"></div>\n<p>Wray also refused to', 'agree with Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) that Hunter Biden&#8217;s <a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/?s=biden+laptop\">laptop</a> was not &#8220;Russian disinformation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When grilled about the FBI ignoring the law that is supposed to have prohibited the pro-abortion activists from protesting outside the homes of the Supreme Court Justices, Wray replied that FBI agents are &#8220;up to their necks enforcing all sorts of laws.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_157061\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-157061\" style=\"width: 1051px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-157061\" src=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.22.28-PM-740x492.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1051\" height=\"699\" srcset=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.22.28-PM-740x492.png 740w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.22.28-PM-1034x687.png 1034w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.22.28-PM.png 1217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px\">FBI Director Christopher Wray</figure>\n<p>The FBI Director then cut his testimony short, announcing he had a plane to catch.</p>\n<span class=\"z-trending-headline\">\n<p style=\"background:#fff\">\n<strong>Trending: </strong><a href=\"https://100percentfedup.com/while-fact-checkers-play-defense-for-obama-heres-the-truth-about-30-million-pages-of-his-regimes-records-that-were-trucked-to-chicago/\" class=\"mostpopular-157017\"><span class=\"mostpopular-title\">While “Fact-checkers” Play Defense For Obama… Here’s The Truth About 30 Million Pages of His Regime’s Records that Were “Trucked to Chicago”</span></a>\n</p>\n</span><p>Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) expressed his confusion after this announcement, saying, &#8220;We just heard a half hour ago about you having to leave at 1:30.

In June, he went to Saranac lake and back to Washington D.C. a few days later on the Gulfstream.</p>\n<p>The use of the FBI&#8217;s Gulfstream jet for private trips is controversial since it was originally intended for counterterrorism use. James Comey, Wray&#8217;s predecessor, also used the jet for private travel.</p>\n<p>The director is required to reimburse the cost of a single class airline ticket for his personal trip, while it costs several thousand dollars an hour to just operate the Gulfstream. So, instead of just flying on a public plane, Wray is choosing to exploit the resources he has as the FBI Director.</p>\n<p>Wray is not the first director to draw criticism for the use of this jet, either. Back in 2013, when Comey was the FBI director, Grassley vocalized his issues with this highly-expensive form of travel, saying,</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;These luxury jets were supposedly needed for counterterrorism, but it turns out that they were used almost two-thirds of the time for jet-setting executive travel&#8230; Nobody disputes that the Attorney General and the FBI Director should have access to the secure communications, but, for instance, there’s no reason they can’t take a less expensive mode of transportation, or cut their personal travel.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"tpd-box-ad-d z-ad-adsense-inline-1 z-ad-revcontent-inline-1\">\n\n\n</div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-157063 aligncenter\" src=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.24.43-PM-740x493.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1052\" height=\"701\" srcset=\"https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.24.43-PM-740x493.png 740w, https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-3.24.43-PM.png 979w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px\"></p>\n<p>Following this display of disrespect in the hearing, top-ranking House Republicans wrote a letter on Monday stating that they will be investigating Wray for potential ethical and financial misconduct over his alleged taxpayer-funded travel.</p>\n<p>The letter reads,</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We write to conduct oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#8217;s (FBI) use of Government aircraft and compliance with the applicable Federal regulations and requirements. We have questions about whether you are properly reimbursing federal taxpayers for your personal travel aboard government aircraft.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It continues,</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although certain federal officials are permitted to use government aircraft for personal or political use, these expenses must be reimbursed. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), past FBI directors have used government aircraft for personal use as is permissible. These former officials reimbursed federal taxpayers at the commercial rate, which can be thousands of dollars less than the actual cost of operating the government aircraft. Reimbursement payments for personal travel are made to the FBI Finance Division, which in turn deposits the funds to the Department of the Treasury.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fox News noted that government plane travel is authorized for &#8220;official purposes&#8221;

That includes the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;I think you should expect that we will continue to do Taiwan Strait transits, as we have in the past, in the coming weeks. …&#8221;</p>\n<h2><b>What About President Biden?</b></h2>\n<p>Not to worry. To the degree it matters, he seems relaxed. On Aug. 8, after China announced new post-Pelosi-visit military drills in the seas and airspace around Taiwan, <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-08-08/biden-says-he-is-concerned-about-chinas-moves-around-taiwan\">Biden expressed mild concern</a> about China’s deployments, but spoke reassuringly to reporters:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“I’m concerned they (the Chinese) are moving as much as they are,” but I don’t think they’re going to do anything more than they are.”</p>\n<h2><b>Is Biden Listening to His Own PR People, and …</b></h2>\n<p>Here is White House Strategic Communications Director <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/08/01/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-security-council-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-2/\"><strong>John Kirby</strong> at a briefing on August 1</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>&#8220;… Nothing has changed – nothing has changed</b> – about our One China policy … Put simply, there is no reason for Beijing to turn a potential visit [by Pelosi] … into some sort of crisis or conflict, or use it as a pretext to increase aggressive military activity in or around the Taiwan Strait. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;And yet, over the weekend, even before Speaker Pelosi arrived in the region, China conducted a live-fire exercise. China appears to be positioning itself to potentially take further steps in the coming days and perhaps over longer time horizons.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Now, these potential steps … could also include actions in the diplomatic and economic space, such as further <b>spurious legal claims like Beijing’s public assertions last month that the Taiwan Strait is not an international waterway</b><b>. </b>[Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Some of these actions would continue concerning trendlines … but some could be of a different scope and scale.&#8221;</p>\n<h2><b>… and is Kirby Listening to the Bobbsey Twins?</b></h2>\n<p>Kirby’s boss, whiz-kid national security adviser <strong>Jake Sullivan</strong> and his elder (but equally innocent twin) <strong>Antony Blinken </strong>have served Biden poorly. In the fine schools they attended, they seem to have concentrated on courses on US Exceptionalism, skipping over what <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/why-john-mearsheimer-blames-the-us-for-the-crisis-in-ukraine\">John Mearsheimer calls</a> &#8220;Balance of Power Politics 101.&#8221;</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>On the key question of Sino-Russian relations, they seem to have been operating out of textbooks a half-century old when they told President Biden that China was &#8220;squeezing&#8221; Russia – the exact opposite of what has been happening for several decades now. Worse still, they seem to have learned close to nothing about what the Soviets used to call the &#8220;world correlation of forces.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a word, these extremely bright whiz kids have helped drive the Chinese and the Russians into each other’s arms. <b>That’s what has changed</b> – plus China’s recent military buildup that makes it a formidable foe.</p>\n<h2><b>Not Hard to See This Coming</b></h2>\n<p>On May 25, 2021, <a href=\"https://original.antiwar.com/mcgovern/2021/05/25/is-the-biden-putin-summit-doomed\">when the date of June 16 was announced</a> for the in-person summit between Presidents Biden and Putin, it seemed necessary to warn Biden and his neophyte advisers that a major shift in the &#8220;world correlation of forces&#8221; was bound to heavily influence the June talks. China, of course, would not be taking part in the bilateral talks, but it would be very much present.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://original.antiwar.com/mcgovern/2021/12/05/biden-putin-talk-tuesday-with-xi-in-the-wings/\">We worried</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Whether or not Official Washington fully appreciates the gradual – but profound – change in America’s triangular relationship with Russia and China over recent decades, what is clear is that the US has made itself into the big loser. The triangle may still be equilateral, but it is now, in effect, two sides against one. …</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“There is little sign that today’s US policymakers have enough experience and intelligence to recognize this new reality and understand the important implications for US freedom of action. Still less are they likely to appreciate how this new nexus may play out on the ground, on the sea or in the air.”</p>\n<p>It was clear that the new phenomenon of Russia-China entente would dwarf the significance of less important issues; and we could not be sure Biden would be appropriately informed. He wasn’t.</p>\n<h2><b>The Chinese &#8220;Squeeze&#8221;</b></h2>\n<p>President Biden did not get the word. <a href=\"https://original.antiwar.com/mcgovern/2021/12/05/biden-putin-talk-tuesday-with-xi-in-the-wings/\">Here is the bizarre way Biden described</a>, at his post-summit presser, his decades-behind-the-times approach to Putin on China:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Without quoting him [Putin] – which I don’t think is appropriate – let me ask a rhetorical question: You got a multi-thousand-mile border with China. China is seeking to be the most powerful economy in the world and the largest and the most powerful military in the world.”</p>\n<p>At the airport, Biden’s co-travelers did their best to whisk him onto the plane, but failed to stop him from sharing more of his views on China – this time on China’s strategic “squeezing” of Russia:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Let me choose my words. Russia is in a very, very difficult spot right now. They are being squeezed by China.”</p>\n<p>Have Biden’s innocent advisers, by now, sought out new textbooks, updated from the ones they may have read in the 70s and 80s. Have they learned that Russia and China have never been closer – that, indeed, they have what amounts to a virtual military alliance?</p>\n<h2><b>Why This Matters</b></h2>\n<p>Back to what may be in store for U.S. warships should they try to enter the Taiwan Strait &#8220;in the coming weeks.&#8221; Will China try to impede or harass them?</p>\n<p>Experts on China tell me there is low likelihood of that, and I defer to their judgment. At the same time I cannot banish from memory what they told me before Russia invaded Ukraine; namely, that China’s principled stand against interference in the affairs of other countries would make it impossible for China to support such an invasion. And yet, the Chinese have been in the forefront of defending it, explaining that Russia’s &#8220;core interests&#8221; are at stake. Bejing is now reminding all that Taiwan is a &#8220;core interest&#8221; of China.</p>\n<p>Would the Chinese expect Russia to have their back, so to speak, if they moved to interdict or harass US warships in the Strait? I believe they would expect that. Russia’s immediate endorsement of China’s policies on the Pelosi visit is one tangible sign pointing in this direction. (Use your imagination and pick the various ways President Putin could up the ante so as to advantage his friend and ally Xi Jinping.)</p>\n<p>Is this worth testing by trying to sail into the Taiwan Strait? Only an innocent hawk would think so. And yet the Chinese have every reason to believe that it is the hawks who are calling the shots in Washington – not Biden. (I discuss some of these issues in a short interview I gave early yesterday <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THTCqiGiFP4\">Sunday</a>, though the connection dropped at minute 8:40.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>Bottom line:</i> The White House has left little incentive for the Chinese to keep pushing what they call a &#8220;Win-Win&#8221; policy. According to reliable sources, when top Chinese officials pressed the mutual advantages of &#8220;Win-Win&#8221; with White House National Security Council China guru Kurt Campbell, they were set back at his response. They described it as “Your win-win<i> IS BULLSH*T!</i>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aside from the use of vernacular, this is not difficult to believe, given what is known about Campbell, who very early on said <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/biden-s-asia-czar-says-era-of-engagement-with-xi-s-china-is-over/t_blank\">“the era of engagement is over.&#8221;</a> Sadly, Campbell is no wiser than the Bobbsey twins with respect to the implications for the US of the virtual alliance that now exists between China and Russia.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Once there, it acts to enhance levels of a critical factor known as TNF-α.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><span class=\"article-annotation\"><span class=\"annotation-term\">TNF-α <i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></span></span>is a molecule with two faces.

Among these is Alzheimer’s disease.</p>\n<p>The study further demonstrates in cell culture studies that glyphosate exposure appears to increase the production of soluble beta amyloid (Aβ) and reduce the viability of neurons. The accumulation of soluble beta amyloid, the sticky protein responsible for the formation of soluble beta amyloid plaques, is one of the central diagnostic hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Further evidence suggestive of potential hazards to neurological health were observed when the researchers examined changes in gene expression via RNA sequencing in the brains of mice following glyphosate exposure.</p>\n<p>These RNA transcripts hinted at disruptions in the expression of genes related to neurodegenerative disease, including dysregulation of a class of brain cells responsible for producing the myelin sheath critical for proper neuronal communication. These cells, known as oligodendrocytes, are affected by elevated levels of TNF-α.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“We find increases in TNF-α in the brain, following glyphosate exposure,” said Velazquez, the senior author of the paper. “While we examined (Alzheimer’s disease) pathology, this might have implications for many neurodegenerative diseases, given that neuroinflammation is seen in a variety of brain disorders.”</p>\n<p>Velazquez and Winstone, the first author on the study, are researchers with the <a href=\"https://biodesign.asu.edu/neurodegenerative-disease/\">ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center</a> and Arizona State University&#8217;s <a href=\"https://sols.asu.edu/\">School of Life Sciences</a>.</p>\n<p>The research appears in the current issue of the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-022-02544-5\">Journal of Neuroinflammation</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>An enigmatic disease; a path of destruction</strong></h2>\n<p>A hundred years have passed since the first diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Despite vast investments in research and drug development, the affliction remains without effective treatment. A suite of therapies, developed over many decades at extravagant cost, have one by one failed to alleviate the symptoms of the disease.</p>\n<p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. The progression of the disease usually begins with mild memory loss. As the disease develops, increasing confusion and a breakdown in communication abilities often result, as the affliction attacks brain pathways involved in memory, language and thought.</p>\n<p>Some 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease, as of 2020, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Unlike heart disease or cancer, the death toll for Alzheimer’s disease is on a frightening upward trajectory. By 2040, costs of the disease are projected to rise dramatically to between $379 billion and more than $500 billion annually. The staggering toll of the illness is currently projected to nearly triple to 14 million people by 2050.</p>\n<p>The onset of symptoms typically occurs after age 60, and the risk to individuals doubles every five years after age 65. Although genetics are believed to play a role in some cases of Alzheimer’s disease and a family history of the disorder is considered a significant risk factor, environmental factors are believed to play a significant role in the disease.</p>\n<p>Researchers are trying to learn how genetic correlates may subtly interact with environmental and other factors to decrease or enhance the likelihood of developing the affliction. Some recent research suggests that lifestyle changes, including proper physical activity, nutritious food, limited alcohol consumption and not smoking may help prevent or slow cognitive decline, noting that brain and cardiovascular health are closely linked.</p>\n<h2><strong>Toxic effects: The jury is out</strong></h2>\n<p>The new study examines the neurological effects of glyphosate, the most ubiquitous herbicide in global use. Each year, around 250 million pounds of glyphosate are applied to agricultural crops in the U.S. alone. Although the chemical is regarded as generally safe to humans by the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Food Safety Authority, researchers are taking a second look.</p>\n<p>Studies of acute herbicide use suggest they are not harmful, but little is known about possible long-term effects from prolonged exposure. One issue of considerable concern is that glyphosate can cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of endothelial cells preventing dissolved substances in the circulating bloodstream from readily passing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system, where the brain’s neurons reside.</p>\n<p>Potential risks to brain health posed by glyphosate should be critically evaluated, particularly for those consistently exposed to the herbicide.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The Alzheimer’s connection is that there&#8217;s a much higher prevalence of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease in agricultural communities that are using this chemical,” Winstone said. “We&#8217;re trying to establish a more molecular-science based link between the two.”</p>\n<p>The study exposed mice to high doses of glyphosate, then detected elevated levels of TNF-α in their brains. The researchers then exposed extracted mouse neurons in petri dishes to the same levels of glyphosate detected in the brains of mice, observing elevated amyloid beta and cell death in cortical neurons. Dysregulated oligodendrocyte RNA transcripts, which could indicate disruption of myelination, were detected in brain tissue.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the results demonstrate a correlation between glyphosate exposure and classic symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, though the authors stress that much more work will be required before a causative link can be established.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the widespread use of the chemical and the disturbing correlates highlighted in the current study underscore the need for intensified investigation. Among the pressing questions to be answered: How does prolonged, low-dose exposure to glyphosate affect the brain; does glyphosate act synergistically with other chemicals present in common herbicides; and can glyphosate be detected post-mortem in patients who died of Alzheimer’s disease?</p>\n<p>On the horizon, new drugs designed to reduce TNF-α in the brain are being explored, offering renewed hope for those with Alzheimer’s disease as well as other neurodegenerative ailments.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

By the 1960s, the city became known as one of the first municipalities where African Americans would rise up in rebellion on the north side during the late August 1964.</p>\n<p>Max Stanford (later known as Muhammad Ahmed), a co-founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) in 1962, was from Philadelphia. RAM proceeded the Black Panther Party (BPP) and sought to form an alliance with Malcolm X (also known as El Hajj Malik Shabazz), a leading spokesman for the Nation of Islam and later the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU). RAM advocated for the development of a revolutionary movement in the U.S. and consequently became a target of the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>In 1969, Mumia joined the Black Panther Party at the age of 15 when the organization was deemed by the then Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) J. Edgar Hoover as the “greatest threat to national security” in the United States. The Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) had a special division which was designed to monitor, disrupt, imprison and kill various leaders and members of African American organizations from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the BPP as well as a host of other tendencies. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) since the mid-to-late 1970s indicate that the BPP was a principal target of the U.S. government and local police agencies.</p>\n<p>Why was the BPP considered so dangerous by the leading law-enforcement agency inside the country? In order to provide answers to this question it must be remembered that between 1955 and 1970, the African American people led a struggle for civil rights and self-determination which impacted broad segments of the population in the U.S. helping to spawn movements within other oppressed communities.</p>\n<p>The Black Panther Party was first formed in Lowndes County Alabama in 1965. Its origins grew out of the organizing work of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), whose field organizer, Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) was deployed to the area in the aftermath of the Selma to Montgomery march in late March of the same year. Working in conjunction with local activists, an independent political party was formed known as the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LCFO). The group utilized the black panther as its symbol while rejecting both the Republican and Democratic Party.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>In subsequent months, there were other Black Panther organizations formed in several cities including Detroit, Cleveland, New York City and other urban areas. In Oakland, California during October of 1966, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.</p>\n<p>This movement represented an emerging phase of the Black liberation struggle where there were calls for armed self-defense, mass rebellion and the political takeovers of major municipalities by those who had been excluded from the reins of official power. Thousands of African American youth flocked to the Black Panther Party viewing the organization as a symbol of uncompromising resistance to racism, national oppression and economic exploitation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Mumia and the BPP</strong></h2>\n<p>Although the BPP was projected in the national corporate media as gun toting militants willing to use weapons against the police when they were threatening the Party and the community, most of the work of the organization revolved around distribution of its weekly newspaper, the establishment of free breakfast programs for children, community health clinics for the people in the most oppressed areas of the African American community while building alliances with revolutionary forces among other sectors of the population including, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Asians, Native Americans and whites committed to fundamental change within U.S. society.</p>\n<p>Mumia noted the diversity of programmatic work during his tenure in the BPP of the late 1960s and early 1970s in his book entitled “We Want Freedom”:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“As the Breakfast program succeeded so did the Party, and its popularity fueled our growth across the country. Along with the growth of the Party came an increase in the number of community programs undertaken by the Party. By 1971, the Party had embarked on ten distinctive community programs, described by Newton as survival programs. What did he mean by this term? We called them survival programs pending revolution. They were designed to help the people survive until their consciousness is raised, which is only the first step in the revolution to produce a new America.… During a flood the raft is a life-saving device, but it is only a means of getting to higher ground. So, too, with survival programs, which are emergency services. In themselves they do not change social conditions, but they are life-saving vehicles until conditions change.” See <a href=\"https://www.commonnotions.org/blog/tag/Mumia+Abu-Jamal\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>On December 4, 1969, the Chicago police under the aegis of the Illinois State’s Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan and the Chicago field office of the FBI, raided the residence of BPP members on the city’s west side. Two Panther leaders, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed while several other occupants of the house were wounded.</p>\n<p>These police actions along with hundreds of other attacks on BPP chapters across the country resulted in the deaths of many Panther members and the arrests and framing of hundreds of cadres. Numerous BPP members were driven into exile as others were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Voice of the Voiceless from the Streets to Death Row</strong></h2>\n<p>On December 9, 1981, Mumia was arrested in Philadelphia and charged with the murder of white police officer Daniel Faulkner. He was railroaded through the courts and convicted on July 3, 1982. The following year, Mumia was sentenced to die by capital punishment. He remained on death row until 2011 after an international campaign to save his life proved successful.</p>\n<p>However, his death sentence was commuted to life in prison without parole. Mumia and his supporters have maintained that he is not guilty of the crime of killing a police officer.</p>\n<p>After his sojourn in the BPP, Mumia utilized his writing and journalist skills learned in the Party to become a formidable media personality in Philadelphia. He was a fierce critic of police brutality and a defender of the revolutionary MOVE organization which emerged during the 1970s in the city.</p>\n<p>Mumia was a co-founder of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in the 1970s. He worked as a radio broadcaster and writer exposing the misconduct of the police surrounding the attack on the MOVE residence in August 1978. In 1979, he interviewed reggae superstar Bob Marley when he visited Philadelphia for a concert performance.</p>\n<p>While behind bars Mumia has become an even more prolific writer and broadcast journalist. He issues weekly commentaries through Prison Radio where he discusses a myriad of topics including African American history, international affairs, political economy, the deplorable conditions existing among the more than two million people incarcerated in the U.S. along with police misconduct. (See <a href=\"https://www.prisonradio.org/correspondent/mumia-abu-jamal/\">this</a>)</p>\n<p>A renewed campaign entitled “Love Not Phear” held demonstrations around the U.S. and the world during the weekend of July 3 marking the 40th anniversary of his unjust conviction in 1982. Love Not Phear says that it is committed to the liberation of all political prisoners including Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>\n<p>An entry on their website emphasizes that:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The landscape has changed over the last 40 years, a time frame that also marks the years Mumia has been incarcerated. The fight for the release of political prisoners requires a recalibration in order to challenge police corruption and racism as they have evolved in this new landscape. We cannot deny the racism, corruption, and misconduct that permeated the so-called ‘Halls of Justice’ during Mumia’s arrest and unjust kangaroo court trial. The people today know the truth; commonplace bribed witnesses, suppressed evidence, biased judges, and backroom deals put Mumia behind bars.” (See <a href=\"https://lovenotphear.com/\">this</a>)</p>\n<p>Mumia through his attorneys have filed another appeal based upon evidence related to prosecutorial misconduct which has been further revealed over the last four years. The hearing will take place on October 19 in Philadelphia. Supporters of Mumia and other political prisoners will attend the hearing in this latest attempt to win the long-awaited freedom for this activist who is now 68 years old.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The source is the MMWR report of August 11, 2022. The title alone shows just how deeply the about-face was buried: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7133e1.htm\">Summary of Guidance for Minimizing the Impact of COVID-19 on Individual Persons, Communities, and Health Care Systems — United States, August 2022</a>. </em></p>\n<p>The authors: “the CDC Emergency Response Team” consisting of “Greta M. Massetti, PhD; Brendan R. Jackson, MD; John T. Brooks, MD; Cria G. Perrine, PhD; Erica Reott, MPH; Aron J. Hall, DVM; Debra Lubar, PhD;; Ian T. Williams, PhD; Matthew D. Ritchey, DPT; Pragna Patel, MD; Leandris C. Liburd, PhD; Barbara E. Mahon, MD.”</p>\n<p>It would have been fascinating to be a fly on the wall in the brainstorming sessions that led to this little treatise. The wording was chosen very carefully, not to say anything false outright, much less admit any errors of the past, but to imply that it was only possible to say these things now.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, <strong>continues to circulate globally</strong>, high levels of vaccine- and <strong>infection-induced immunity</strong> and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post–COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death. These circumstances now allow public health efforts to <strong>minimize the individual and societal health impacts</strong> of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce <strong>medically significant illness</strong> as well as to <strong>minimize strain </strong>on the health care system, while<strong> reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity.</strong>“</p>\n<p>In English:<em> everyone can pretty much go back to normal</em>. Focus on illness that is medically significant. Stop worrying about positive cases because nothing is going to stop them. Think about the bigger picture of overall social health. End the compulsion. Thank you. It’s only two and a half years late.</p>\n<p>What about mass testing?</p>\n<p>Forget it: “All persons should seek testing for active infection when they are <strong>symptomatic</strong> or if they have a known or suspected exposure to someone with COVID-19.”</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>What about the magic of track and trace?</p>\n<p>“CDC now recommends case investigation and contact tracing <strong>only</strong> in health care settings and certain high-risk congregate settings.”</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>What about the unvaccinated who were so demonized throughout the last year?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“CDC’s COVID-19 prevention recommendations<strong> no longer differentiate based on a person’s vaccination status </strong>because breakthrough infections occur, though they are generally mild, and persons who have had COVID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection.”</p>\n<p>Remember when 40% of the members of the black community in New York City who refused the jab were not allowed into restaurants, bars, libraries, museums, or theaters? Now, no one wants to talk about that.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Also, universities, colleges, the military, and so on – which still have mandates in place – do you hear this? Everything you have done to hate on people, dehumanize people, segregate people, humiliate others as unclean, fire people and destroy lives, now stands in disrepute.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as of this writing, the blasted US government still will not allow unvaccinated travelers across its borders!</p>\n<p>Not one word of the CDC’s turgid treatise was untrue back in the Spring of 2020. There was always “infection-induced immunity,” though Fauci and Co. constantly pretended otherwise. It was always a terrible idea to introduce “barriers to social, educational, and economic activity.” The vaccines never promised in their authorization to stop infection and spread, even though all official statements of the CDC claimed otherwise, repeatedly and often.</p>\n<p>You might also wonder how the great reversal treats masking. On this subject, there is no backing off. After all, the Biden administration still has an appeal in process to reverse the court decision that the mask mandate was illegal all along. “At the high COVID-19 Community Level,” the CDC adds, “additional recommendations focus on all persons <strong>wearing masks indoors </strong>in public and further increasing protection to populations at high risk.”</p>\n<p>The problem from the beginning was that there never was an exit strategy from the crazy lockdown/mandate idea. It was never the case that they would magically cause the bug to go away. The excuse that we would lock down in wait for a vaccine never made any sense.</p>\n<p>People surely knew early on of the social, economic, and cultural devastation that would ensue. If they did not, they never should have been anywhere near the control switches of public health. Badges and bureaucracies do not terrify a virus destined to spread to the whole planet. And not one person with even the most casual passing knowledge of coronaviruses could have sincerely believed that a vaccine would magically appear to achieve something never before achieved in the whole history of medicine.</p>\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://gbdeclaration.org/\">Great Barrington Declaration</a> appeared on October 4, 2020, it caused a global frenzy of fury not because it said anything new. It was merely a pithy restatement of basic public-health principles, which pretty much instantly became verboten on March 16, 2020, when Fauci/Birx announced their grand scheme.</p>\n<p>The GBD generated mania because the existing praxis was based on preposterously unproven claims that demanded that billions of people buy into complete nonsense. Sadly many did simply because it seemed hard to believe that all world regimes but a handful would push such a damaging policy if it was utterly unworkable. When something like that happens – and there never was the hope that it could work – the regime imperative becomes censorship and shaming of dissent. It’s the only way to hold the great lie together.</p>\n<p>So finally, nearly two years later the CDC has embraced the Great Barrington Declaration rather than doing a “quick and devastating takedown” as Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci called for the day after its release. No, they had to try out their new theory on the rest of us. It did not work, obviously. For the authors of the GBD, they knew from the time they penned the document that it was a matter of time before they were vindicated. They never doubted it.</p>\n<p>Dr. Rajeev Venkayya is widely <a href=\"https://brownstone.org/articles/how-fanatics-took-over-the-world/\">credited</a> with coming up with the idea of lockdowns while he was working for the Bush administration back in 2005. He had no training at all in public health or epidemiology. He later marveled that it fell to him, a young desk-dwelling White House bureaucrat, to “invent pandemic planning.” Maybe he should have demurred that day that George W. Bush asked him to lead the charge to inaugurate a new war on pathogens.</p>\n<p>Somehow his views gained converts, among whom was Bill Gates, the foundation for whom he worked for years. The rest is history.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, Venkayya called me to explain why I needed to stop attacking lockdowns. He said that the planners need a chance to make their scheme work.</p>\n<p>On the phone, I asked the same question over and over: where does the virus go? The first two times, he did not respond. I pressed and pressed. Finally he said there will be a vaccine.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to appreciate just how preposterous that sounded at the time, and I said something along those lines: it would be a medical miracle never before seen to have a shot for a coronavirus that was sterilizing against wild type and all inevitable mutations, and to do it in a reasonable time so that society and economy had not completely fallen apart.</p>\n<p>The whole approach was clearly milliennarian at best and utter madness at worst. And here I was, in the thick of global lockdowns, on the phone with the architect of the whole idea, an idea that had reduced billions to servitude, wrecked schools and churches, and sent communities and countries into complete upheaval. I wondered at the time what it would be like to be Dr. Venkayya that day. After all this ended in disaster, would he take responsibility? His LinkedIn profile today says otherwise: he is prepared to “tackle current and future epidemic &amp; pandemic threats as the CEO of Aerium Therapeutics.”</p>\n<p>There never was an exit strategy from lockdowns and mandates but they eventually did find an exit nonetheless. It came in the form of a heavily footnoted and opaquely written reversal, published by the main bureaucracy responsible for the disaster. It amounts to a repudiation without saying so. And thus does the great experiment in mass compulsion come to an intellectual end. If only the carnage could be cleaned up by another posting on the CDC’s website.</p>\n<p>By the way, the Biden administration has extended the declaration of Covid emergency. And my unvaccinated friends in the UK still can’t board a plane to come for a visit.</p>\n<p>All of this gives rise to the great question: what was the point? Maybe it was all a mistake and now it is gone forever but that’s unlikely. The intellectuals who pushed this project on the world have a view of the world that is fundamentally ill-liberal. They differ among themselves on the details but the general approach is technocratic central planning rooted in deep suspicion of basic tenets of freedom.</p>\n<p>How many people on the planet have now been acculturated to top-down control, socialized to live in fear, accept whatever comes down from above, never to question an edict, and expect to live in a world of rolling man-made disasters? And was that the point after all, to cultivate low expectations for life on earth and relinquish the soul’s desire for a full and free life?</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

People’s World was invited to attend this important event. The goal was to raise awareness and funds for Agent Orange clean up and for resources to care for the victims.</em></p>\n<p>The program opened with remarks from<strong> Senior Lt. General Nguyen Van Trinh</strong>, director of VAVA. The program then shared some success stories, such as the clearing of Da Nang International Airport of the remaining dioxin. Examples of other places still in the process of being cleared were also shared. The program featured interviews with victims, their families, and their caregivers.</p>\n<p>The program ended with thanking various people from across Vietnam that have raised funds, donated, or volunteered to help those suffering the ill effects of the toxins. This aid came from across the social and economic spectrum. Philanthropists, students, youth groups, and other grassroots initiatives were all well represented.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Starting in August 1961, until the end of the war in 1973, the U.S. military dropped Agent Orange and similar chemical weapons on 5.6 million acres of Vietnamese land. Over 90% of these lands were poisoned at least twice. By the end of the war, an estimated five million Vietnamese people were poisoned by these illegal weapons.</p>\n<p>But the crime didn’t end with the U.S. retreat from Vietnam. The awful effects of Agent Orange have been passed down from parent to child and from child to grandchild. This means that every year there are new victims born. Every year there are new victims that suffer the horrible disabilities and deformities caused by the toxins in Agent Orange and other dioxin weapons. Today, there are nearly 4.8 million Vietnamese still suffering from the toxins first dropped on Vietnam 61 years ago.</p>\n<p>Despite many promises made by the U.S. government to help the Vietnamese government and people with the aftermath of the U.S.’ illegal warfare, aid has been lacking. To date, 61 years later, the U.S. government has only ever helped with environmental cleanup and has never provided any help for the millions of people that suffered and continue to suffer from dioxin poisoning.</p>\n<p>Today, <strong>Rep. Barbara Lee,</strong> D-Calif., remains the only consistent voice calling for the U.S. government to take responsibility for its past crimes in Vietnam. Year after year, Lee proposes legislation to help care for the victims of Agent Orange. She is joined by the <a href=\"https://vn-agentorange.org/\">Vietnam Agent Orange Relief &amp; Responsibility Campaign</a> (VAORRC) and other advocacy groups that try and lobby for funding for the victims. Unfortunately, year after year, the rest of Congress fails to give the initiative enough support, leading to its failure.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the victims of Agent Orange were not exclusively those bombed by the U.S. military. Many U.S. veterans who handled and managed the containers of the chemicals and their decedents fell ill due to their handling of the toxins. While some veterans did receive <a href=\"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/toxic-legacy-part-2-fighting-for-justice-after-chemical-warfare-in-vietnam/\">minimal compensation</a>, the chemical companies that made the toxins have been protected by the U.S. courts from having to take any responsibility for their crimes.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that the U.S. government was running <a href=\"https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/after-months-of-denial-u-s-admits-to-running-ukraine-biolabs/\">biological labs in Ukraine</a>. This horrifying revelation suggests the lessons from history have not been learned. While other countries seek to ban the use of unconventional weapons and create safeguards to deter their use, the U.S. military still goes in the other direction.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Schulte is yet to be tried on state child pornography charges.</em></p>\n<p>Prosecutors had literally no evidence that Schulte had taken the data from the CIA and transferred it to WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>But they contended that he was a computer genius who is so brilliant that he was able to cover his tracks.</p>\n<p>They alleged that he leaked the information because he was a disgruntled former CIA employee who hated his boss, couldn’t get along with his coworkers, and sought revenge against the Agency.</p>\n<p>That was enough for the jury.</p>\n<p>CIA Deputy Director for Digital Innovation <strong><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7geyn/ex-cia-hacker-convicted-for-one-of-the-most-damaging-acts-of-espionage-in-american-history\">Sean Roche</a></strong> called the Vault 7 leak “a digital Pearl Harbor.”</p>\n<p>Chief prosecutor <strong>Damian Williams</strong> said the revelations were “one of the most brazen and damaging acts of espionage in American history.” And Vice magazine said it was “the worst leak of CIA information ever.”</p>\n<p>The CIA leadership apparently thought the leak was so damaging that then-CIA <strong>Director Mike Pompeo</strong> ordered the Agency to come up with a plan to <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html\">kidnap or to kill</a> <strong>Julian Assange</strong> in London. One former Trump Administration national security official said that Pompeo and other senior CIA leaders, “were completely detached from reality because they were so embarrassed about Vault 7. They were seeing blood.”</p>\n<p>All of the major media outlets reported on the finalization of Schulte’s case. What they haven’t reported on, though, is exactly what Schulte was accused of leaking in the first place.</p>\n<p>What did we learn from Vault 7?</p>\n<p>Vault 7 was a series of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/europe/wikileaks-cia-hacking.html\">24 collections of documents</a> totaling hundreds of thousands of pages that included the most sophisticated computer hacking, surveillance, and cyberwarfare tools that the CIA ever developed.</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks published the first tranche, called “Year Zero,” on March 7, 2017.</p>\n<p>Just this first installment contained more information than all of that released by Edward Snowden and included vulnerabilities known to the CIA within web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera and the operating systems of most of the world’s cellphones, including Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The fact that the CIA knew about these vulnerabilities and didn’t inform the companies was a violation of a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-dont-want-violence-stop-partnering-cia-us-military-2021-1\">longstanding policy</a> that the Agency claims to have that it would assist U.S. tech companies with their security if it learned of security weaknesses.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Instead, it exploited those problems in its digital operations. We have no idea if the Agency used these vulnerabilities to spy on Americans. Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/privacy-experts-cia-americans-open-cyber-attacks-580659\">said at the time</a>, “Our government should be working to help the companies patch vulnerabilities when they are discovered, not stockpile them.”</p>\n<p>A second Vault 7 revelation came on March 23, 2017 and included accounts of CIA efforts to hack Apple’s iPhones and Mac computers.</p>\n<p>Additional tranches were released every week or two until September 2017.</p>\n<p>Their revelations included proof that the CIA was able to hack into cars’ computer systems and could take over control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>Was the purpose of this to force the vehicle off the road? Off a cliff? Into a tree? The CIA never commented.</p>\n<p>Still other documents showed how CIA officers could take over an unsuspecting person’s smart TV and turn its speaker into a microphone to surreptitiously bug a room, even while the television appears to be turned off.</p>\n<p>Yet other documents showed that the CIA was running digital operations against the National Security Agency (NSA). It is unclear whether this was done as an exercise between the two agencies or if it was something more sinister.</p>\n<p>Other revelations were that the CIA had created a program to track documents transferred by would-be whistleblowers to media outlets (the program is called “Scribblers”), malware that can take over and control computers using the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system (called “Athena”), and malware that can be transferred from one “clean” computer to another through internal systems that are otherwise protected by anti-virus software (called “Pandemic”).</p>\n<p>Schulte’s revelations were not limited to software. He also revealed a program called “HammerDrill,” that injects a trojan horse onto CDs and DVDs and then documents information on the discs for later transmission to the CIA.</p>\n<p>An operation called “Dark Matter” revealed security vulnerabilities unique to Apple operating systems. And Schulte revealed that the CIA had compromised vulnerabilities in a huge range of Cisco Systems router models. Apple and Cisco spent untold millions of dollars to redesign their products and correct the security flaws.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that this was supposedly the worst data breach in the history of the CIA, Schulte and his revelations did not get much press play.</p>\n<p>There are several likely reasons for this. First, Schulte claimed innocence. He insisted that he was not a whistleblower and he has maintained throughout his ordeal that he did not provide WikiLeaks with anything.</p>\n<p>Second, the state of New York, simultaneously with the federal charges, charged Schulte with multiple counts of child pornography, which has given many of Schulte’s natural supporters pause.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors maintained that they only discovered the pornography when they seized the computer hard drives in Schulte’s apartment while looking for Vault 7 information. Schulte’s defense to the child pornography charges will be that he considers himself to be a libertarian anarchist and that he set up a server to allow people unfettered “free speech,” something akin to the 4chan and 8chan servers.</p>\n<p>He maintains that he has not “received” or “disseminated” any child pornography personally. However, when child pornographers saw that Schulte’s server supported “unfettered free speech,” they used it to trade illegal images and videos. Schulte is adamant that none of the pornography was his. His protestations likely won’t matter.</p>\n<p>I’m of two minds on Joshua Schulte. On the one hand, the American people have a right to know what the government is doing in their name, especially if what the government is doing is illegal. On the other hand, Schulte is adamant that he is not the person who provided WikiLeaks with the information. Does that mean we walk away from Schulte and celebrate an anonymous whistleblower?</p>\n<p>Either way, one of the things that I feel strongly about is the treatment that Schulte has endured.</p>\n<p>He has been held in barbaric conditions over the past two years, kept in a literal cage in solitary confinement at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44235 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?resize=580%2C573&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?resize=300%2C296&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?resize=150%2C148&amp;ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"pictures depicting a typical ADMAX SHU cell and show (moving clockwise from top left) the bunk bed, shower, seating area, and combination toilet and sink fixture.\" width=\"562\" height=\"556\" data-attachment-id=\"44235\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/16/former-cia-officer-joshua-schulte-faces-as-many-as-80-years-in-prison-after-being-convicted-on-nine-felony-accounts-for-providing-information-to-wikileaks/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?fit=580%2C573&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"580,573\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?fit=300%2C296&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pictures-depicting-a-typical-admax-shu-cell-and-sh.jpeg?fit=580%2C573&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Picture of solitary confinement cell at New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center in Brooklyn where Schulte was kept for two years.

Edgar Hoover</strong>, whose obsession with communism and “subversion” allowed him to justify violating the civil rights and civil liberties of millions of Americans.</em></p>\n<p>Under COINTELPRO, which Hoover initiated in 1956, the F.B.I. surveilled, infiltrated, discredited, disrupted, burglarized and harassed American citizens and organizations as diverse as the Communist Party USA, anti-Vietnam War protestors, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, the American Indian Movement, environmentalists, animal rights organizations, Puerto Rican nationalists and even the National Lawyers’ Guild.</p>\n<p>The program continued until 1971, when a group of progressive activists <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Burglary-Discovery-Edgar-Hoovers-Secret/dp/0804173664/ref=sr_1_1?crid=119UTDBCN7R0R&amp;keywords=the+burglary+by+betty+medsger&amp;qid=1660254827&amp;sprefix=the+burglary%2Caps%2C118&amp;sr=8-1\">broke into an F.B.I. field office</a> in Media, Pennsylvania, stole documents related to COINTEPRO, and sent them to the press.  Nobody in the F.B.I. was ever punished for the program’s many illegalities, but the “burglars” who revealed the program were hunted for decades.  None were ever caught.</p>\n<p>And now, 51 years after it ended, a bill has been introduced to the U.S. Congress that would expose still classified details of the F.B.I.’s abuse of power.</p>\n<p><strong>Rep. Bobby Rush</strong> (D-IL) on May 4 sponsored the legislation that would do some exciting things.  The <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2998\">COINTELPRO Full Disclosure Act</a> would require the U.S. federal government to publicly disclose, within six months of being signed into law, all records related to the F.B.I.’s illegal COINTELPRO operation “that would not cause harm” to the national security.</p>\n<p>It would also establish something called the “COINTELPRO Records Review Board” to review determinations by government offices that do not fully disclose their records after six months.  To top it off, the bill would also require the removal of J. Edgar Hoover’s name from the F.B.I.’s headquarters building in Washington.</p>\n<p>The measure was assigned to the House Oversight and Reform Committee as well as to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  A day later, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.  There has been no action on the bill since May, and no concurrent bills have been sponsored in the Senate.</p>\n<h2><strong>The FBI’s Aims</strong></h2>\n<p>COINTELPRO had specific goals.  According to the book <em>Surveillance and Governance: Crime Control and Beyond</em> by Mathieu Deflam, F.B.I. agents were tasked with creating a negative public image for the groups and people targeted; breaking down the organizations by creating internal conflicts; creating dissension among groups that otherwise might be allied; restricting access to public resources, such as through non-profits; restricting the ability to organize protests, such as by having F.B.I. agents who had infiltrated the groups threaten violence against police or initiate violence; and restricting the ability of individuals to participate in group activities through character assassination, rumor, innuendo, and false arrests.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>MIT professor and activist Noam Chomsky <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03js1k4\">told the BBC</a> in 1996,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“COINTELPRO was a program of subversion carried out not by a couple of petty crooks, but by the national political police, the F.B.I., under four administrations.  By the time it got through, it was aimed at the entire New Left, at the women’s movement, at the whole Black movement.  It was extremely broad.  Its actions went as far as political assassination.”</p>\n<p>Certainly, the F.B.I. carried out political assassinations against members of the Black Panther Party.  An even better known COINTELPRO target, though, was Martin Luther King.  Immediately following the 1963 March on Washington, F.B.I. Special Agent William Sullivan, the officer in charge of COINTELPRO, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/enemieshistoryof0000wein_w8s0\">wrote to Hoover</a>, saying,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“In light of King’s powerful demagogic speech (the “I Have a Dream” speech), we must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation from the standpoint of communism, the Negro, and national security.”</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-82791 aligncenter\" src=\"https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" srcset=\"https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k.jpg 2048w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-500x333.jpg 500w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-1000x665.jpg 1000w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-768x511.jpg 768w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14611533571_c9ed146d01_k-160x106.jpg 160w\" alt=\"\" width=\"557\" height=\"370\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">F.B.I. headquarters in Washington. (Gareth Milner, Flickr, CC BY 2.0)</span></p>\n<p>Within weeks, the F.B.I. had bugged King’s home and his hotel rooms, they had planted informants around him and they had designated King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference as a “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/j-edgar-hoovers-revenge-information-the-fbi-once-hoped-could-destroy-rev-martin-luther-king-jr-has-been-declassified-118026\">subversive organization</a>.”</p>\n<p>Hoover’s most degenerate action within COINTELPRO was a plan in 1964 to try to convince King to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/j-edgar-hoovers-revenge-information-the-fbi-once-hoped-could-destroy-rev-martin-luther-king-jr-has-been-declassified-118026\">commit suicide</a>.  King had begun to criticize the F.B.I. publicly in 1963 for not treating the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist organization.  In response, Hoover ordered that King’s communications be intercepted.</p>\n<p>And on Nov. 21, 1964, just two days after the announcement that King had won the Nobel Peace Prize, the F.B.I. sent him a “<a href=\"applewebdata://D2A7FC7A-0527-4215-9C9D-30E543120D27#/media/File:Mlk-uncovered-letter.png\">suicide package</a>” that contained audio recordings of his liaisons with various women.  An attached letter said,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“There is only one way out for you.  You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation.”</p>\n<p>The letter went on to say that the tapes would be released to the media if he did not kill himself before accepting the Peace Prize.  And, indeed, Hoover ordered that the tapes be sent to <em>Newsweek</em> and <em>Newsday</em>. Even after King was assassinated in 1968, the FBI continued to malign his memory by providing his enemies with information to enable attacks on his character.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-82795 aligncenter\" src=\"https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-scaled.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" srcset=\"https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-500x333.jpg 500w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/One_Vets_Sq_Media_Delco_PA-160x107.jpg 160w\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"383\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">This building in Media, Pennsylvania, now known as County Court Apartments, was the site of the March 8, 1971, break in of the local F.B.I. office that resulted in the exposure of the CoIntelPro program. (Smallbones, CC0, Wikimedia Commons)</span></p>\n<p>There was literally nothing good about COINTELPRO.  It was illegal.  It was unethical.  It was immoral.  It was used to prevent Americans from exercising their constitutional rights.  It was a dark period in American history — one of the darkest in modern American history.  Our government owes it to the American people to lay the information bare.  All of COINTELPRO should be declassified.  Bobby Rush’s bill would do that.</p>\n<p>I say <em>would</em>, rather than will, because this bill has an almost zero chance of passing through both houses of Congress and being signed into law by the president.  That it was referred to a subcommittee in May and has had no subsequent action is akin to a death notice.</p>\n<p>But it is possible to give it life.  I’ve spent years on Capitol Hill, working first for a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania and later as the senior investigator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  I can tell you that a letter from a constituent has a great deal of authority, far more so than an email.  Members of Congress really do react to letters from the people they represent.  It may sound quaint, or even a little silly, but that’s democracy at work.   This bill can be discharged from the subcommittee if the public demands it.</p>\n<p>Bobby Rush was right to sponsor this bill.  The F.B.I. should have declassified COINTELPRO decades ago.  Remember, the American people own this information.  They deserve to know what their government has done in their name.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

and will therefore withhold all of the funds as inflation and other factors<a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/10/70-economists-say-us-must-return-7-billion-stolen-afghan-people\"> push the prices</a> of Afghan goods up by nearly 100% in some cases.</p>\n<p>The U.S. had been <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/02/11/ilhan-omar-blasts-unconscionable-biden-plan-seize-afghan-assets\">considering</a> placing $3.5 billion in a trust fund for Afghanistan to spend addressing its humanitarian crisis—with the other half of the money being set aside for the families of 9/11 victims, over the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/03/03/afghanistan-starvation-crisis-911-families-biden/\">objections </a>of some of those family members who believe all the money should be used to benefit Afghan civilians.</p>\n<p>The U.S. has pledged more than $774 million in aid to Afghanistan over the past year, but economists including Shah Mehrabi, an economics professor at Montgomery College in Maryland and a board member of Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), have warned that foreign humanitarian assistance <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-rules-out-releasing-billions-in-afghan-funds-after-strike-11660564801\">&#8220;is not a solution&#8221;</a> to the widespread suffering that has taken hold across the country.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Many poor women and children will not be able to buy bread and other necessities of life,&#8221; Mehrabi told the <em>Journal. </em>&#8220;Those reserves belong to the central bank, and have to be used for monetary policy.&#8221;</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Anti-war group CodePink added that while the U.S. has criticized the Taliban for keeping women out of government positions over the past year and shutting down schools for girls, withholding funds from the country only gives women &#8220;a harder time fighting for their rights.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A reminder that no one is better suited to struggle for progress in Afghanistan than the Afghan people themselves.

Otherwise they go days without eating.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Considering the dire circumstances facing millions of Afghan people, Daniel DePetris of the foreign policy think tank Defense Priorities called the Biden administration&#8217;s decision &#8220;shortsighted, morally unconscionable, and potentially calamitous.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So apparently, the U.S. will no longer release ANY of the $7 billion in Afghan foreign reserves.

It comes 22 years after the EPA first proposed adding DINP to the list, known as the Toxics Release Inventory.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers treat plastics with DINP-category chemicals to provide greater flexibility and softness to the final product, the EPA said.</p>\n<div id=\"rebelltitem1\" class=\"rebellt-item    col1\" data-id=\"1\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"True\" data-href=\"https://www.ehn.org/plastic-cancer-dinp-2657829595/toxics-release-inventory\" data-basename=\"toxics-release-inventory\" data-post-id=\"2657829595\" data-published-at=\"1659996288\" data-use-pagination=\"False\">\n<h2 data-role=\"headline\"><strong>Toxics Release Inventory</strong></h2>\n<div id=\"rebelltitem1\" class=\"rebellt-item    col1\" data-id=\"1\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"True\" data-href=\"https://www.ehn.org/plastic-cancer-dinp-2657829595/toxics-release-inventory\" data-basename=\"toxics-release-inventory\" data-post-id=\"2657829595\" data-published-at=\"1659996288\" data-use-pagination=\"False\">\n<p>If finalized, the rule will require manufacturers that make or process more than 25,000 pounds of DINP-category chemicals per year – or use more than 10,000 pounds annually – to report certain information to the agency. That data include quantities of DINP-category chemicals released into the environment or otherwise managed as waste.</p>\n<p>The Toxics Release Inventory is meant to give the public information about chemicals at facilities in their area, how they are being managed, and if they are being released into the environment. Facilities that make and use the chemicals and the waste sites where the products end up are disproportionately found near impoverished neighborhoods, often home to People of Color.</p>\n</div>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<div id=\"rebelltitem2\" class=\"rebellt-item    col1\" data-id=\"2\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"False\" data-href=\"https://www.ehn.org/plastic-cancer-dinp-2657829595/dinp-health-risk\" data-basename=\"dinp-health-risk\" data-post-id=\"2657829595\" data-published-at=\"1659996288\" data-use-pagination=\"False\">\n<h2 data-role=\"headline\"><strong>DINP health risk</strong></h2>\n<p>DINP-class chemicals are suspected carcinogens. The European Food Safety Authority considers them to be endocrine-disrupting compounds that interfere with testosterone. The EPA attributes exposure to developmental effects and kidney and liver toxicity.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the Healthy Environment and Endocrine Disrupting Strategies coalition, a group of senior researchers concerned about chemicals that hijack hormonal function, issued a warning about DINP to manufacturers seeking a replacement for other harmful plasticizers such as DEHP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Enough is known to classify it as an anti-androgen, a developmental neurotoxicant, and a potential obesogen,&#8221; the group said. &#8220;Precautionary science argues against that replacement.&#8221; HEEDS is a project of Environmental Health Sciences, publisher of EHN.org.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"rebelltitem3\" class=\"rebellt-item    col1\" data-id=\"3\" data-reload-ads=\"false\" data-is-image=\"False\" data-href=\"https://www.ehn.org/plastic-cancer-dinp-2657829595/new-approach-to-chemical-regulation\" data-basename=\"new-approach-to-chemical-regulation\" data-post-id=\"2657829595\" data-published-at=\"1659996288\" data-use-pagination=\"False\">\n<h2 data-role=\"headline\"><strong>New approach to chemical regulation</strong></h2>\n<p>Patricia Taylor, former director of the Plastics and Waste Reduction Project at Environment and Human Health, Inc., called this a &#8220;possible sea change&#8221; for federal chemical management.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The public will gain access to this information and this will allow them to better protect themselves against exposures and to ask for monitoring, regulations, and restrictions or bans,&#8221; she said. That data, she added, can be used by researchers to analyze health and environmental impacts in studies such as health and life-cycle assessments.</p>\n<p>Taylor noted two other striking takeaways from Monday&#8217;s decision:</p>\n<p>First, federal regulators first raised alarm about health impacts associated with the chemical in 2000. &#8220;This is a clear example of the glacial pace of the review process at EPA,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Second, the ruling covers a class of chemicals, rather than a specific one – suggesting the EPA is &#8220;inching towards&#8221; policies that regulate chemicals by class. &#8220;This is something being strongly recommended by independent scientists who research chemicals such as phthalates, bisphenols and other endocrine disruptors used to make plastics,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such restrictions by class would prevent some of the &#8216;regrettable substitutions\'&#8221; – many compounds used in &#8220;BPA-free&#8221; products are just as harmful as BPA, for instance – &#8220;which are now standard practice by industries when faced with information that a chemical in their product is harmful to health or the environment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

He gave bin Salman a pass for Khashoggi’s murder—and for hundreds of thousands murdered in Yemen—precisely to buy more oil at lower prices (which, in fact, for all his pandering, he did not succeed in getting, returning home from his Middle East trip embarrassingly empty-handed).</p>\n<p>So it is no surprise that Biden caved to pressure from the intelligence community, and is pursuing the same warped vendetta against Julian Assange as Trump’s former CIA Director, Mike Pompeo. The Biden administration is brutally murdering Assange just as deliberately as bin Salman murdered Khashoggi—and for the same reason—because Assange exposed incriminating information that the government wanted to cover up.</p>\n<p>In a just world, Assange would be celebrated for exposing deceit, corruption and criminal behavior. Instead, he is being victimized on behalf of the very criminals whose crimes he exposed.</p>\n<p>Most upsetting of all is how Assange has been abandoned by his former media partners at <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Le Monde</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>El Pais</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em>. This abandonment is ironic, since the secret documents that Assange gave them to publish—and for which they earned numerous journalistic accolades—are the very documents for which the U.S. is indicting Assange under the Espionage Act.</p>\n<p>Assange’s crime was to tell the American public about the evil its government was committing in its name. The <em>public’s </em>crime would be to allow him to be imprisoned for life by the very government that committed those crimes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44361 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=565%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?w=565&amp;ssl=1 565w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?resize=150%2C126&amp;ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"568\" height=\"478\" data-attachment-id=\"44361\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/16/giant-satirical-billboards-mounted-on-trucks-driven-all-over-the-nations-capital-are-publicly-shaming-democratic-party-leaders-for-their-illegal-persecution-of-julian-assange/image-6-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=565%2C476&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"565,476\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png?fit=565%2C476&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Billboard truck driving past Washington Monument.

They are alerting the public to this parody of justice, and hopefully will pressure Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop the case against Assange.</p>\n<p>If the U.S. government succeeds in jailing Assange for revealing its crimes, it will kill independent investigative journalism forever. It will allow any journalist, from any country in the world, who dares to reveal U.S. crimes, to be extradited for treason, dragged to this country, and imprisoned.</p>\n<p>If you want to support Credico’s mobile billboard campaign to free Assange (it requires money to keep those trucks rolling), you can make a donation <a href=\"https://www.assangecountdowntofreedom.com/billboard?s=03\">HERE.</a></p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 1: Randy Credico </strong>is a recent winner of an “Award for Journalistic Excellence” from the Society for Independent Investigative Journalism. He hosts the influential radio and podcast series <strong>Assange: Countdown to Freedom </strong>and is a tireless creator of “awareness events” to generate public and political pressure for release of the most important publisher of the 21<sup>st </sup>century.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE 2: </strong>Credico first tried to buy billboard space for his “Free Assange” campaign from Clear Channel, the world’s largest outdoor media company, whose billboards dominate the entire DC area. But Clear Channel is tightly tied to the U.S. extreme right, and–no surprise—refused to run billboards urging (gasp!) freedom for a Hillary-hugging, Russia-loving traitor like Julian Assange. “Your billboards don’t meet our community standards,” he was told.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Randy was rescued by the plucky owner of a one-man outdoor media company called <a href=\"http://dcmobileads.com/\">DC Mobile Ads</a>, who convinced Randy to forget about traditional billboards and put his campaign on wheels—which he happily did. The company owner loves the billboards so much that he volunteered to drive one of the trucks all over D.C. himself. An especially nice touch is that the graphic designer for the billboards is an Australian <a href=\"about:blank\">resident named Somerset Bean (@somersetbean), who is delighted to do his part to help an Aussie countryman out of a tough spot</a>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
