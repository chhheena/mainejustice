Many parents just want to wait and see. I tell them the vaccine has been studied, and there were no shortcuts in the studies. This is our best ticket out of \\u2026 this pandemic.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Tenenbaum said the most common misconception he\\u2019s heard from parents is that the vaccine could cause problems with fertility, even though the science clearly shows the COVID-19 vaccines do not affect fertility.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cSerious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination,\\u201d according to the U.S. CDC.<\\/p>\\n<p>If the pattern for elementary schoolchildren follows the same pattern as what happened with their older brothers and sisters in middle and high schools \\u2013 who have been eligible for the vaccines since this spring \\u2013 immunization rates will vary in different parts of the state.<\\/p>\\n<p>Four in five Cumberland County residents ages 12-19 are fully immunized, and nearly 70 percent in Knox and Lincoln counties. But vaccination rates in Piscataquis, Washington, Somerset and Lincoln counties for that age group are less than 46 percent.<\\/p>\\n<p>Those geographic trends are similar when it comes to adult vaccinations, although vaccination rates for youths are significantly lower overall.<\\/p>\\n<p>Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out in a media briefing last week that the percentage of people willing to get vaccinated can change over time as acceptance grows. That\\u2019s what happened with vaccines for adults.<\\/p>\\n<p>For instance, 80 percent of people ages 12 and older are fully vaccinated in Maine, slightly above the national average of 78 percent. But a national Kaiser Family Foundation survey in September 2020, before vaccines became widely available in 2021, showed that only 63 percent of adults said they \\u201cdefinitely\\u201d or \\u201cprobably\\u201d would get vaccinated.<\\/p>\\n<p>Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a South Portland pediatrician, said when she tries to persuade parents in the \\u201cwait-and-see\\u201d category, she emphasizes that the more people are vaccinated, the closer to normal their children\\u2019s lives \\u2013 and everyone\\u2019s lives \\u2013 will be.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI try to talk to parents about how the vaccines are important for the continuation of school and the programming that kids like \\u2013 sports and activities \\u2013 and the need for kids to have a life that\\u2019s more normal,\\u201d Blaisdell said. \\u201cWhen kids have to quarantine and miss school, that disruption in kids\\u2019 lives and parents\\u2019 lives is one of the issues I talk to parents most about.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The Maine Department of Education reported Thursday that there have been 144 outbreaks in Maine schools in the past 30 days, and nearly 3,000 people testing positive. The department does not say how many of those people are students versus adults. But each outbreak typically means students who were exposed and are not vaccinated must quarantine at home and miss classes.<\\/p>\\n<p>Blaisdell said the upcoming holidays are also a key point in favor of the vaccines. Children who get vaccinated in mid-November can be fully vaccinated by December.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI try to get them to think about traveling to visit older grandparents or people in the family who may be immune-compromised, and children\\u2019s role in transmitting the disease,\\u201d Blaisdell said. \\u201cKids clearly transmit the delta variant very efficiently, and they can do so with very few symptoms.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Research shows being vaccinated significantly reduces the chances of transmitting the virus to someone else.<\\/p>\\n<p>Asen said also top of mind is that by having Davida immunized, it will help protect other family members, including her 3-year-old sister and infant brother, grandparents and a 95-year-old great-grandmother.<\\/p>\\n<p>And while it\\u2019s rare for children to get severe COVID-19 to the point that they are hospitalized or die, it\\u2019s not impossible. Children with COVID-19 have been known to contract multi-inflammatory syndrome, a very rare condition where organs can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs, according to the U.S. CDC.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>THE ROLLOUT<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, the largest health care network in the state, said they are working on standing up clinics across the state, primarily in schools and community clinics. Pharmacies and doctor\\u2019s offices will also be places where the vaccine will be available.<\\/p>\\n<p>But Mills said to avoid pediatrician\\u2019s offices being swamped with requests for the vaccine, MaineHealth is working to quickly launch the school-based clinics. Some will start up the week of Nov. 8, and others the following week.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is our water on the pandemic fire,\\u201d Mills said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re very geared up. The challenge is to hit the demand just right. The demand will be high for a while and then dissipate, but we don\\u2019t know how long the demand will be high. We want to do as many vaccine clinics as possible before Thanksgiving week so that kids can get the second dose in before Christmas week.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The first and second doses for the Pfizer vaccine are spaced three weeks apart.<\\/p>\\n<p>Depending on how many parents sign up their children for vaccination, having ages 5-11 immunized will increase the state\\u2019s overall vaccination rates by about 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent, Mills said.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is a critical age group to vaccinate,\\u201d Mills said. \\u201cThis is a population that gathers a lot, not just in schools but on playgrounds and in other people\\u2019s homes.

Forced vaccination with an experimental \\\"for emergency use only\\\" shot has precipitated death or injury for over 500,000 Americans.<\\/p>\\n<p>Is this really happening? Are you sure this isn\'t 1938 Nazi Germany, or a communist country that provides no civil or human rights to its citizens? Because this can\'t be America.<\\/p>\\n<p>That figure of over 500,000 total deaths, serious injuries and adverse effects linked to the COVID-19 vaccines is not from me ... it\'s not from some wild, unreliable internet rumor ... it comes from the vaccine adverse event reporting system called VAERS that\'s connected to the U.S. government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\'s more deaths and injuries than all the vaccines in the past three decades combined, by a mile. By the way, throughout history, VAERS has always underreported deaths and injuries by a wide margin.<\\/p>\\n<p>In the European Union, the same vaccine reporting system reports over 20,000 dead and over 2 million injured by the vaccines.<\\/p>\\n<p>But the media has blacked out the deaths and injuries from the vaccines like they\'re an image of underage sex on Hunter Biden\'s laptop. Facts that destroy the government agenda scare the media to death.<\\/p>\\n<p>What if all of this were happening and former President Donald Trump were serving his second term? The exact same vaccines, the exact same results. Just imagine with me.<\\/p>\\n<p>What if Trump were president and the government swore the vaccines would prevent COVID-19, but when the vaccinated started getting sick, the goal post was changed 180 degrees? Suddenly, everyone admits the vaccinated are getting COVID-19 and they can spread it, too. Suddenly their viral load is as high as unvaccinated people\'s. Suddenly the vaccines aren\'t effective against \\\"variants.\\\" Suddenly its only use is in preventing hospitalizations. Talk about three-card Monte.<\\/p>\\n<p>But do COVID-19 vaccines actually prevent hospitalizations? In Israel, doctors report as many as 95% of patients hospitalized are vaccinated. If Trump were president, would anyone be getting vaccinated anymore after hearing those numbers? Would any Democrat? Would any black American?<\\/p>\\n<p>How about closer to home? In Massachusetts, there are 9,969 \\\"breakthrough cases\\\" of vaccinated people with COVID-19, and over 100 vaccinated people are dead of COVID-19. That\'s reported by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.<\\/p>\\n<p>But those are just COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated. That has nothing to do with the deaths and serious injuries tied to the COVID-19 vaccines themselves.<\\/p>\\n<p>If Trump were president, the media would be reporting those numbers in gigantic headlines and calling \\\"Trump\'s vaccine\\\" a \\\"Frankenstein\'s monster.\\\" They\'d be accusing Trump of murder. They\'d be calling him \\\"Hitler.\\\"<\\/p>\\n<p>Not one Democrat in America would be taking these vaccines.<\\/p>\\n<p>There would be Black Lives Matter riots as black Americans accused Trump of racism and genocide. The American Civil Liberties Union would be filing lawsuits in every city, county and state in America. They\'d call forced vaccinations under Trump \\\"the civil rights issue of our lifetime.\\\"<\\/p>\\n<p>And the children? Are you aware Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (the most respected in the world) just did a study of 45,000 American kids with COVID-19 and found zero deaths among healthy children? Zero as in zero.

Forced vaccination with an experimental \\\"for emergency use only\\\" shot has precipitated death or injury for over 500,000 Americans. Is this really happening? Are you sure this isn\'t 1938 Nazi Germany, or a communist country that provides no civil or human rights to its citizens? Because this can\'t be America.\\nThat figure of over 500,000 total deaths, serious injuries and adverse effects linked to the COVID-19 vaccines is not from me ... it\'s not from some wild, unreliable internet rumor ... it comes from the vaccine adverse event reporting system called VAERS that\'s connected to the U.S. government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nIt\'s more deaths and injuries than all the vaccines in the past three decades combined, by a mile. By the way, throughout history, VAERS has always underreported deaths and injuries by a wide margin.\\nIn the European Union, the same vaccine reporting system reports over 20,000 dead and over 2 million injured by the vaccines.\\nBut the media has blacked out the deaths and injuries from the vaccines like they\'re an image of underage sex on Hunter Biden\'s laptop. Facts that destroy the government agenda scare the media to death.\\nWhat if all of this were happening and former President Donald Trump were serving his second term? The exact same vaccines, the exact same results. Just imagine with me.\\nWhat if Trump were president and the government swore the vaccines would prevent COVID-19, but when the vaccinated started getting sick, the goal post was changed 180 degrees? Suddenly, everyone admits the vaccinated are getting COVID-19 and they can spread it, too. Suddenly their viral load is as high as unvaccinated people\'s. Suddenly the vaccines aren\'t effective against \\\"variants.\\\" Suddenly its only use is in preventing hospitalizations. Talk about three-card Monte.\\nBut do COVID-19 vaccines actually prevent hospitalizations? In Israel, doctors report as many as 95% of patients hospitalized are vaccinated. If Trump were president, would anyone be getting vaccinated anymore after hearing those numbers? Would any Democrat? Would any black American?\\nHow about closer to home? In Massachusetts, there are 9,969 \\\"breakthrough cases\\\" of vaccinated people with COVID-19, and over 100 vaccinated people are dead of COVID-19. That\'s reported by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\\nBut those are just COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated. That has nothing to do with the deaths and serious injuries tied to the COVID-19 vaccines themselves.\\nIf Trump were president, the media would be reporting those numbers in gigantic headlines and calling \\\"Trump\'s vaccine\\\" a \\\"Frankenstein\'s monster.\\\" They\'d be accusing Trump of murder. They\'d be calling him \\\"Hitler.\\\"\\nNot one Democrat in America would be taking these vaccines.\\nThere would be Black Lives Matter riots as black Americans accused Trump of racism and genocide. The American Civil Liberties Union would be filing lawsuits in every city, county and state in America. They\'d call forced vaccinations under Trump \\\"the civil rights issue of our lifetime.\\\"\\nAnd the children? Are you aware Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (the most respected in the world) just did a study of 45,000 American kids with COVID-19 and found zero deaths among healthy children? Zero as in zero. Only a handful of children in all of America died from COVID-19, and Johns Hopkins reports all of them had childhood cancer.\\nSo, if Trump were president and the government demanded every schoolchild be masked and vaccinated with a dangerous and sometimes deadly experimental vaccine, even though there was zero risk of death from this flu bug, what would liberals say? How about feminist mothers?\\nYou don\'t have to guess. I know. Liberal mothers across America would say, \\\"Trump wants to murder our children.\\\"\\nBut most importantly, looking at the VAERS numbers shows thousands dead and over 500,000 injured, many seriously, in connection to this experimental jab. If Trump were president, doctors and medical experts would be demanding an immediate suspension of this vaccine program. The media would be touting \\\"Trump vaccine deaths\\\" on the front page.\\nIf Trump were president, no Democrat would take the jab.

The order, effective on Dec. 8, does not allow testing as an option for people who do not want to get vaccinated.<\\/p>\\n<p>Religious and medical exemptions from vaccination may be granted, according to the executive order, but while those requests are pending, a Federal District Court Judge\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/resistthemainstream.org\\/judge-blocks-biden-admin-from-firing-unvaccinated-employees-with-pending-religious-exemptions-biden-admin-responds\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">issued<\\/a>\\u00a0a restraining order on Thursday to prevent federal employees from being fired for not yet complying with the vaccine mandate. In that lawsuit, filed last month, Biden and members of his administration were sued by 20 plaintiffs over his Sept. 9 executive order requiring vaccines for all federal employees and contractors.<\\/p>\\n<p>All the state lawsuits argue that the mandate violates federal procurement law and is an overreach of federal power. The states believe Biden\\u2019s vaccine mandate violates the principle of state sovereignty enumerated by the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it uses federal spending to coerce the states. Finally, they point out the federal government did not properly allow for 60 days of public comment.<\\/p>\\n<p>Ironically, the failure to follow proper procedure may be the weakest point and yet the one allows the Supreme Court to invalidate Biden\\u2019s executive order without ruling on the merits of a federal vaccine mandate. That would mirror the court\\u2019s answer to Democrat challenges to former President Donald Trump\\u2019s executive order ending DACA. The court ruled Trump\\u2019s order not lawful because the administration did not properly explain why they were overturning former President Barack Obama\\u2019s executive order before issuing the order.<\\/p>\\n<p>Texans are as fired up about vaccine mandates as residents of the Sunshine State.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed its disdain for Americans who choose not to get a vaccine, and it has committed repeated and abusive federal overreach to force upon Americans something they do not want,\\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement Friday. \\u201cThe federal government does not have the ability to strip individuals of their choice to get a vaccine or not.

These same reports state that Harris is eager to distance herself from President Joe Biden, who she views as a sinking ship. Conservative media personality Jack Posobiec, who has multiple reliable sources inside the White House, claimed that \\u201cKamala Harris is referring to Joe Biden as the \\u2018Titanic\\u2019 behind his back and that Dr. Jill Biden was asking if it was possible to remove a sitting VP over the past weekend.\\u201d There has long been rumored to be no love lost between Jill and Harris. During the Democratic primary presidential debates in 2019, Harris attacked Biden for his record opposing federally mandated interracial busing to desegregate schools. \\u201cThat little girl was me!\\u201d Harris told him in a cutting moment that quickly went viral. Days later, during a phone call with reporters, Jill is said to have cussed out Harris for attacking her husband in this way. \\u201cWith what he cares about, what he fights for, what he\\u2019s committed to, you get up there and call him a racist without basis? Go f\\u2013k yourself,\\u201d Jill allegedly said, according to an account published by Politico. \\u201cShe couldn\\u2019t bear to watch a woman who called herself a friend of her son\\u2019s \\u2014 although Beau was not her biological child, she\\u2019d raised him his entire life as if he were \\u2014 try to tear her husband down, to score a point at a debate,\\u201d Politico\\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere claimed. When asked for comment on these reports, Jill\\u2019s spokesperson said, \\u201cMany books will be written on the 2020 campaign, with countless retellings of events \\u2014 some accurate, some inaccurate. The first lady and her team do not plan to comment on any of them.\\u201d When Jill herself was asked about the reports back in May, she replied, \\u201cMy goodness, that was two years ago. We have moved on from that,\\u201d according to Insider. Judging by the latest reports coming in about Jill and Harris, however, it seems that they most certainly have not moved on. Biden was also infuriated by the attack, as he reportedly turned to fellow candidate Pete Buttigieg on the debate stage afterward and said, \\u201cThat was some f\\u2013king bullshit.\\u201d Since Biden took office, Buttigieg has been named as his transportation secretary. Despite her attack on Biden, Harris was named as his Vice President.

Newspaper op-eds have been published and some radio spots have aired across the state. It is unlike the millions spent on another question posed to Maine voters this year over whether to ban construction of electrical transmission lines across a portion of the state.<\\/p>\\n<p>But unlike the transmission line question, proponents and skeptics of Maine\\u2019s right to food initiative believe the issue may crop up in other states. Indeed, Washington and West Virginia have begun to consider it.<\\/p>\\n<p>Furthermore, the question has shaken the stereotypical political alliances. Faulkingham, a Republican, has pushed for the bill with Senator Craig Hickman, a Democrat who runs an organic farm. The coalition opposing the adoption of the amendment include animal rights groups and agricultural associations.<\\/p>\\n<p>Detractors say the amendment\\u2019s language is too vague and could lead to unintended consequences for how animals are raised and how food safety is enforced in the state.<\\/p>\\n<p>According to Faulkingham, the proposed right to food amendment grew out of a grassroots food sovereignty movement.<\\/p>\\n<p>Around the time Faulkingham began paying attention to the movement, years before he entered the legislature in 2018, the state had cracked down on a Maine farmer who it said was not licensed to sell raw milk.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt definitely struck me the wrong way\\u2026 what it seemed like the government was doing to him,\\u201d Faulkingham said.<\\/p>\\n<p>In 2014, the Maine Supreme Court ruled against Dan Brown, a farmer who had sold raw milk without a distributor\'s license and argued a town ordinance exempted him from the state requirements regarding the labeling of his milk when he sold it from a farmers\\u2019 market and a stand.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Maine Supreme Court took up the matter and ruled against Brown, saying the municipal exemption only applied to inspection and licensing requirements at the local level.<\\/p>\\n<p>In 2017, the legislature passed the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/legislature.maine.gov\\/statutes\\/7\\/title7ch8-F.pdf\\\">Maine Food Sovereignty Act<\\/a>\\u00a0that allowed towns to pass ordinances that prevented state food laws from applying to producer-to-consumer purchases of food.<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"article-container\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"article-content\\\">\\n<p>The question now before Maine voters, Faulkingham said, will codify an individual right, similar to that of the Maine\\u2019s right to bear arms: the\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.maine.gov\\/legis\\/const\\/\\\">Constitution\\u2019s language<\\/a>\\u00a0says it\\u2019s a right that cannot be questioned but it also comes with restrictions.<\\/p>\\n<p>Little will change if the amendment passes, Faulkingham said, but it would help promote self-sufficiency in the land with deep farming, hunting and fishing traditions.<\\/p>\\n<p>For now, the right to food is a preventative one, designed to be a bulwark against government infringement, the lawmaker said, though he does not see a lot of infringement currently.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe worry about that in the future,\\u201d Faulkingham said. \\u201cAnd we think that a constitutional right, definitely gives some people some standing when it comes to those sorts of things.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Denisse Cordova Montes, professor at the University of Miami, said Maine is leading the nation in asking its voters about enshrining a right to food, a right that\\u2019s recognized internationally, from constitutions of various countries to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<\\/p>\\n<p>Cordova Montes, a human rights lawyer who has worked on the right to food, said the right is a holistic one that encompasses consuming sustenance with dignity. Food, Cordova Montes said, should be nutritionally adequate whether the individual is a baby or a pregnant mother, and accessible to the person who is seeking to grow their own food and the person living in a food desert, which are communities far away from a grocery store where they could obtain healthy food.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cBy including it in the Constitution, it will result in, I think, the government of Maine taking it into account when it comes to policy planning \\u2026 It just becomes a priority in the state,\\u201d Cordova Montes said.<\\/p>\\n<p>In April, Cordova Montes and an intern with the University of Miamai School of Law\\u2019s Human Rights Clinic issued a\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/miami.app.box.com\\/s\\/oatj0isyglmilyetwz7kgpuri2arwleh\\\">legal memo<\\/a>\\u00a0to the Maine Attorney General arguing the right to food resolution being considered in the legislature did not include a right to commercially produce and save seeds, which allowed the state to continue to regulate seeds for diseases and blight.<\\/p>\\n<p>Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action said it has only been in the last few years that some states have banned the use of intensive confinement of animals on large commercial farms. Over the years, he has worked on ballot initiatives in states such as Massachusetts and California to ban extreme confinement and fought ballot measures in places such as Oklahoma which considered right-to-farm questions that would have prevented the prohibition on such confinement.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>Pacelle said he\\u2019s concerned about copycat resolutions in other states and that could be used to roll back animal welfare protections. The right-to-food amendment seems to have grown from Maine food sovereignty movement, but its language he sees to be a combination of right-to-farm and a right-to-hunt resolutions.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe all think that we should have access to food and it should be wholesome and it should be quality food, but the measure doesn\'t do anything to advance that. I mean, it\'s just not clear that the rhetoric aligns with the actual language of the provision,\\u201d Pacelle said.<\\/p>\\n<p>Beth Gallie, president of the Maine Animal Coalition, says amending the constitution should be rare and already the constitution says whatever rights are not enumerated in the document are reserved for the people.<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"article-container\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"article-content\\\">\\n<p>\\u201cIf everyone starts putting their rights into the Constitution, it\'s like a 100-page document. No, it\'s not the way to go,\\u201d Gallie said.<\\/p>\\n<p>In previous years, the legislature considered other versions of the right to food amendment. This version, Gallie said, does not raise as many red flags but there are still concerns. She also worries that creating a constitutional right and questions surrounding it would be left in the hands of the state\\u2019s judges. \\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>But Scott Bloomberg, a law professor who teaches constitutional law at Maine University School of Law, said if the Maine courts interpret the right, they will probably look to evidence about what the voters thought they were enacting, if it\\u2019s passed.<\\/p>\\n<p>The courts are unlikely to conclude that the right obligates the government to provide food to the state\\u2019s residents, but nevertheless, they will \\u201chave to grapple with what is the scope of the right and what kind of laws intrude on the right,\\u201d Bloomberg said.<\\/p>\\n<p>But 100 years into the future? Courts could take a more expansive reading, Bloomberg said.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf this is really a response to a future problem, it is really hard to assess what a court is going to make of it and when is somebody going to challenge a law, under this amendment,\\u201d Bloomberg said.<\\/p>\\n<p>Julie Smith, executive director of the Maine Farm Bureau Association, said the vague language of the proposed amendment could lead to unintended consequences for food safety. The kind of foods Maine farmers produce is varied, said Smith, from wild blueberries, a diverse number of vegetables and \\u201csome of the best tasting milk in the whole United States.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The bureau supports customers buying raw milk, Smith said, but licensing is important.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t see bacteria,\\u201d Smith said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no way to know whether your milk is safe or not for consumption unless you test it.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>But a court could decide, under the proposed amendment, that an individual who got sick drinking uninspected milk chose to buy that milk. According to Smith, the question becomes whether the state had a right to inspect the dairy farmer to see if, say, the farm\\u2019s water source is contaminated.<\\/p>\\n<p>Furthermore, Smith said it could affect hunting and fishing laws, hampering efforts to notify individuals digging for clams that there\\u2019s a red tide, for instance.<\\/p>\\n<p>And while the question before voters over the transmission lines attracted more dollars than the right to food question, Smith said the latter is the more important issue.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis absolutely impacts every single person in the state of Maine and it impacts their future,\\u201d Smith said. \\u201cA transmission line, you know what? You can take it down and the forest can regrow. You take away food safety, people die.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>There has been little polling on this issue. Whether voters see this as a common-sense enshrinement of a right to self-sufficiency or they see unintended effects to the state\\u2019s animals and food safety, those involved in the issue will find out on Election Day if the voters decide it\\u2019s a bite they want to take.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"twitter-button-embed\\\"><a class=\\\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-button-error\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/jcksndnl\\\" data-size=\\\"large\\\" data-show-count=\\\"false\\\" data-twitter-extracted-i1635724993206739412=\\\"true\\\">Follow @jcksndnl<\\/a><\\/div>\\n<div>\\u00a0<\\/div>\\n<div id=\\\"email-subscribers\\\">Source:\\u00a0\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.courthousenews.com\\/in-maine-a-push-to-enumerate-a-constitutional-right-to-food\\/\\\">https:\\/\\/www.courthousenews.com\\/in-maine-a-push-to-enumerate-a-constitutional-right-to-food\\/<\\/a>\\u00a0<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"114\",\"created\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"created_by\":\"82\",\"created_by_alias\":null,\"modified\":\"2021-11-09 12:25:04\",\"modified_by\":\"82\",\"checked_out\":0,\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_associations\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_page_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image\\\":\\\"images\\\\\\/2021\\\\\\/10\\\\\\/31\\\\\\/AP20331588456867-1880x1254.jpg\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_format\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"gallery\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"audio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_url\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_text\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_status\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"4\",\"ordering\":1,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"10\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":1,\"language\":\"*\",\"xreference\":null}', '0');/**ABDB**/

In filings with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the Duke of York called Giuffre\\u2019s \\u201cbaseless\\u201d lawsuit an effort to \\u201cachieve another payday\\u201d from her accusations against the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"ev-meter-content\\\">\\n<p>Andrew, 61, who is Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s second son, also said he was released from liability under a 2009 settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein, a registered sex offender. He said that agreement covered \\u201croyalty,\\u201d among others, and that Epstein had insisted it cover \\u201cany and all persons\\u201d who Giuffre might sue.\\u201dVirginia Giuffre may well be a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein, and nothing can excuse, nor fully capture, the abhorrence and gravity of Epstein\\u2019s monstrous behavior against Giuffre, if so,\\u201d Andrew\\u2019s lawyers wrote.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cHowever, and without diminishing the harm suffered as a result of Epstein\\u2019s alleged misconduct, Prince Andrew never sexually abused or assaulted Giuffre,\\u201d they added. \\u201cHe unequivocally denies Giuffre\\u2019s false allegations against him.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cDavid Boies, a lawyer for Giuffre, said in a statement that Andrew\\u2019s bid to dismiss the lawsuit \\u201cfails to confront the serious allegations\\u201d it contained.<\\/p>\\n<p>He also said the settlement agreement \\u201con its face\\u201d applies \\u201cat most\\u201d to people involved in underlying litigation in Florida, thereby excluding the prince. \\u201cPrince Andrew\\u2019s attempt now to use the 2009 release as a get out of jail free card shows how desperate he is to dodge and duck the facts of what he did,\\u201d Boies said. Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Giuffre, 38, sued Andrew for unspecified damages in August, accusing him of forcing her to have sex at the London home of Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime Epstein associate. She also accused Andrew of abusing her at Epstein\\u2019s mansion in Manhattan, and on one of Epstein\\u2019s private islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.<\\/p>\\n<p>In Friday\\u2019s filings, Andrew\\u2019s lawyers said Giuffre had already \\u201cpurportedly received millions of dollars\\u201d from settling a 2015 defamation lawsuit against Maxwell, where according to court papers she had sought $50 million .The lawyers said they would also challenge a 2019 New York law that gave survivors of childhood sexual abuse a now-closed two-year window to sue their alleged abusers over conduct occurring many years or decades earlier.<\\/p>\\n<p>That law allowed Giuffre to pursue her case, but according to the lawyers deprived the prince of his due process rights under New York\\u2019s state constitution. The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, the state\\u2019s top law enforcer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<\\/p>\\n<p>Andrew has not been charged with crimes. He gave up many royal duties and lost support from charities and organizations after a disastrous November 2019 BBC interview in which he did not appear sympathetic toward Epstein\\u2019s victims.<\\/p>\\n<p>The next hearing in Giuffre\\u2019s lawsuit is set for Nov. 3.Giuffre was sued separately for $20 million on Thursday for allegedly defaming on Twitter an artist who has said she brought women to Epstein but denied being a recruiter. The artist, Rina Oh Amen, sued over tweets including that she \\u201cprocured &amp; partook in the abuse of minors.\\u201d Amen called the tweets \\u201cmaliciously false,\\u201d and said Epstein also abused her.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"non-city-story-widget\\\">Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges for allegedly helping recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.

Pandemic restrictions also kept reporters and the public out of the courtroom during the sex-trafficking trial of music star R. Kelly.<\\/p>\\n<p>And in an Ohio courtroom, a federal judge relegated the press to an overflow room to listen to an audio feed for the trial of a Chinese national charged with trying to steal trade secrets from U.S. companies.<\\/p>\\n<p>A year-and-a-half into the coronavirus pandemic, courts across the U.S. are still grappling with how to balance public health concerns with the constitutional rights of a defendant and the public to have an open trial. There\'s no standard solution. Some courts are still functioning entirely virtually. Others are back in person. And many are allowing only limited public access.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is a fundamental constitutional right that the public has \\u2014 to have open courts and to be able to see what\\u2019s happening in real-time in a courtroom,\\u201d said David Snyder, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, which has prodded California courts to improve public access during the pandemic.<\\/p>\\n<p>Covid-19 space constraints have led judges across the U.S. to exclude or limit public and media attendance at trials.<\\/p>\\n<p>During\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/apnews.com\\/article\\/r-kelly-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-trials-new-york-6fede99231f4d28257725391dae28ebd\\\">Kelly\'s trial, which concluded last month with his conviction<\\/a>, a federal judge in New York barred the press and public from the courtroom because jurors were sitting six feet apart in the gallery normally used by observers. Onlookers could watch a live video feed in an overflow courtroom, but it offered no view of the jury and only limited images of the defendant, witnesses and exhibits. At one point, prosecutors played a recording that jurors listened to with headphones, with no audio available for the press and public.<\\/p>\\n<p>The judge rejected\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.documentcloud.org\\/documents\\/21090645-r-kelly-trial-media-letter\\\">a request by media groups<\\/a>, including The Associated Press, to allow pool reporters in the courtroom for much of the trial, letting six reporters in only when the verdict was announced.<\\/p>\\n<p>A similar scenario played out last week in Ohio, where a federal judge cited the pandemic while keeping the public out of\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/apnews.com\\/article\\/business-china-cincinnati-theft-espionage-71b6b102ffeae25d273794974829af28\\\">the courtroom for the trial of Yanjun Xu<\\/a>, a Chinese official accused of trying of steal trade secrets from U.S. aviation and aerospace companies. There was no public access to jury selection. Audio of the trial was played for media in a conference room.<\\/p>\\n<p>Overflow rooms are better than nothing but often leave observers unable to see the full context of what\'s occurring, like the reaction of jurors as evidence is presented, said New York attorney Rachel Strom, who represented media in the R. Kelly case.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\\"We don\\u2019t know what we missed by not having someone actually in the courtroom,\\u201d Strom said.<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"article-container\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"article-content\\\">\\n<p>After the AP and other media filed legal motions, a Georgia judge granted just two media pool seats in the courtroom right before the start of jury selection\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/apnews.com\\/article\\/ahmaud-arbery-social-media-georgia-media-racial-injustice-bafd1ce62feddc6879dd54b972c1cb3f\\\">in the trial of three white men charged with chasing and killing Arbery<\\/a>. Graphic cellphone video of the 25-year-old Black man being shot sparked outrage nationally last year, and the trial is being closely watched as a referendum on how the legal system treats Black victims. The judge has since allowed a third reporter and a photographer into the courtroom.<\\/p>\\n<p>In another high-profile case, the press and public initially were allowed to listen remotely to court proceedings as pop star Britney Spears sought to end her father\'s conservatorship over her finances. But Los Angeles County Superior Court canceled the remote access after someone recorded a hearing, and the court refused to reinstate it\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/apnews.com\\/article\\/britney-spears-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-los-angeles-8ed8d18ff75eee08fb58c5ddd4625f4f\\\">for a September hearing when Spears was freed\\u00a0<\\/a>from her father\'s oversight. The court instead allowed more people into the courtroom.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.documentcloud.org\\/documents\\/21090618-usa-today-court-filing-in-britney-spears-case\\\">USA Today recently asked the California Supreme Court<\\/a>\\u00a0to order the restoration of remote audio for the public and media.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo one should have to risk their health to exercise their constitutional right of access by travelling to, and attending, court in person,\\u201d USA Today said in its court filing. It also suggested the remote audio program should continue \\u201ceven when the pandemic ends.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The California request highlights how the pandemic has shifted expectations about what qualifies as public access.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs courts open back up, they should strongly consider keeping some amount of remote access available to the public,\\u201d said Lin Weeks, an attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.<\\/p>\\n<p>Many courts now are routinely using video conferencing in civil lawsuits, for bail proceedings in criminal cases and for family law disputes such as child-custody and divorce cases. Some also are using video conferencing to select jurors or to conduct entire jury trials.<\\/p>\\n<p>Court officials say the virtual proceedings have saved time and money for attorneys, jurors, litigants and defendants, who no longer have to travel to a courthouse, take extensive time off work or arrange child care. Courts also have seen fewer no-shows among those summoned to virtual jury pools and, as a result, greater diversity on juries.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt has been a lifeline as we\\u2019ve tried to keep the justice system moving during the pandemic, but it\\u2019s also been transformational,\\u201d said Sean O\\u2019Donnell, a superior court judge in King County, Washington, home of Seattle.<\\/p>\\n<p>King County judges have conducted about 700 online trials, including about 50 with jurors. During a trial that O\\u2019Donnell presided over last week, the judge, attorneys, witness and jurors appeared on a 20-tile Zoom screen that the public could view on YouTube. Two jurors sat in clothes closets. One participated from his vehicle. Another was chided by O\\u2019Donnell to remove his cat from the camera view. A witness testified from Oregon, a couple hundred miles away.<\\/p>\\n<p>Despite those oddities, the virtual trial progressed much like a regular trial, with attorneys taking turns questioning witnesses and evidentiary documents displayed on the screen for all to see. There even were periodic breaks where participants stood up and stretched.<\\/p>\\n<p>Conducting the trial virtually also freed up space at the courthouse. To accommodate social distancing, in-person trials are using as many as three separate courtrooms \\u2014 one for the actual trial, a second for the public to view it remotely and a third for the jury to use during breaks and deliberations, O\\u2019Donnell said.<\\/p>\\n<p>Across Hawaii\'s chain of islands, the ability to observe courts virtually has increased public access during the pandemic.<\\/p>\\n<p>John Burnett, a reporter for the Hawaii Tribune-Herald, wasn\'t able to cover state Supreme Court or U.S. District Court proceedings before the pandemic because it required a 50-minute plane ride from Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, where his newspaper is based, to Honolulu on the island of Oahu.

(AP Photo\\/John Minchillo, File)<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"article-content\\\">\\n<p>NEW YORK (AP) \\u2014 A judge on Thursday rejected British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell\\u2019s bid to block the public and news media from jury selection in her New York City trial on charges she recruited teenage girls for financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.<\\/p>\\n<p>U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan said the press and public will be allowed to view the selection proceedings next month via video feeds to an overflow courtroom and a courthouse press room. She said two pool reporters will be let into the courtroom as she questions prospective jurors.<\\/p>\\n<p>In deciding on the issue, Nathan said she strove to balance the public\\u2019s right to access court proceedings with health measures, such as adding extra space between parties, that have been put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a journalist consortium, and more than a dozen news organizations had written to the judge Wednesday opposing the defense\\u2019s request to select jurors in secret.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re all aware that there\\u2019s been intense media and public interest in this case. ... These procedures will ensure the First Amendment rights to public access as is necessary and required by law,\\u201d Nathan said on a pretrial conference call.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nathan also denied a defense request to prevent the public from seeing the blank questionnaire that will be given to about 600 people who will be summoned as prospective jurors in the high-profile case.<\\/p>\\n<p>The selection of 12 primary jurors and six alternates is scheduled to begin Nov. 4, with opening statements set for Nov. 29. In selecting primary jurors, the defense will have 10 peremptory challenges and the prosecution will have six, Nathan said. For alternates, each side will get three challenges.<\\/p>\\n<p>Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers argued for questioning prospective jurors behind closed doors because they may be asked to divulge sensitive information, such as if they have been sexually abused. Nathan said she would make adjustments on a case-by-case basis to \\u201censure juror candor and project juror privacy.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Maxwell lawyer Bobbi Sternheim said letting the public see the blank version of the questionnaire, which is used to screen the jury pool for biases, hardships, personal connections and awareness of the case, will lead to people lying their way into the jury process. She equated it to a \\u201ctake-home exam\\u201d in which jurors could fill in answers they think will best position them to be selected.<\\/p>\\n<p>Nathan, who will conduct one-on-one follow-up questioning Nov. 16-19 with prospective jurors who survive the questionnaire phase, responded: \\u201cIf a juror is going to lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that out. And the fact of this questionnaire being publicly documented is not going to increase or decrease any such likelihood.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Maxwell, whose father was a British newspaper baron,\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/apnews.com\\/article\\/ny-state-wire-trials-ghislaine-maxwell-05c7d66a0885da88021a908615c211ba\\\">has pleaded not guilty<\\/a>\\u00a0to charges that she recruited teenage girls from 1994 to 2004 for Epstein to sexually abuse during encounters that sometimes were described as sexualized massages. A revised indictment filed in March included allegations she groomed a 14-year-old girl to recruit other young females in return for cash.<\\/p>\\n<p>Epstein killed himself at a Manhattan federal lockup in August 2019, a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.<\\/p>\\n<p>Maxwell, 59, joined the conference call Thursday from an empty room at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she has been held since her July 2020 arrest. She didn\\u2019t say much, except to complain about the call\\u2019s wonky connection and to assure the judge she was still on the line when another communications mishap occurred.<\\/p>\\n<p>___<\\/p>\\n<p><em>By MICHAEL R.

Shortly after the marathon bombing, as authorities interviewed associates of the suspects, Tamerlan\'s friend, Ibragim Todashev, said it was Tamerlan who slit the men\'s throats. As Todashev wrote out his confession to the murders, however, he attacked the agents, one of whom shot and killed him.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>The government obtained its search warrant for Tamerlan\\u2019s car based on Todashev\\u2019s claims, but they did not present the evidence to the jury at Dzhokhar\'s trial on the basis that the confession was unreliable, that its exclusion would be harmless, and it was possible the issue would confuse the jury.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven if jurors found the Waltham evidence credible, Tamerlan\\u2019s alleged commission of independent crimes almost two years before the bombing had no reasonable prospect of altering the jury\\u2019s recommendation that respondent receive the death penalty for his own acts of terrorism,\\u201d the government\\u2019s brief states.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>For Tsarnaev\\u2019s attorney, however, the Waltham murder evidence could have been used to show that Tamerlan radicalized his younger brother.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cHaving successfully excluded this powerful corroboration of Tamerlan\\u2019s history of extremist violence, the government was free to belittle the defense\\u2019s mitigation theory,\\u201d Anders said in the brief. \\u201cProsecutors told jurors that Tamerlan was merely \\u201cbossy,\\u201d that Dzhokhar radicalized on his own, and that Tamerlan was able to act on his extremist views only when Dzhokhar joined him.\\u201d\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>The government warns that retrying Tsarnaev\'s sentencing could be longer than the previous 21-day proceeding and submit the victims to again relive the trauma of that day.\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<p>At the time of the original trial, however, the parents of Martin Richard, an 8-year-old killed at the marathon, urged the government to take the death penalty off the table.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe understand all too well the heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed,\\u201d Bill and Denise Richard said in a\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.bostonglobe.com\\/2020\\/07\\/31\\/metro\\/bill-denise-richard-end-anguish-drop-death-penalty-2\\/\\\">letter published in the Boston Globe<\\/a>. \\u201cWe were there.

Mexico wants cases to generally conclude within six months, timely and accurate access to case information and better access to legal counsel for asylum-seekers.<\\/p>\\n<p>Some of the administration\\u2019s most prominent pro-immigration allies say the time it took for Mayorkas to draft Friday\\u2019s opinion showed a lack of sense of urgency, which U.S. officials dispute.<\\/p>\\n<p>Many U.S.-based legal aid groups who have represented asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico say they will no longer take such cases, raising questions about how the U.S. can satisfy Mexico\'s insistence on better access to counsel. Administration officials say they believe there are enough other lawyers who will represent asylum-seekers sent back to Mexico.<\\/p>\\n<p>About 70,000 asylum-seekers have subject to the policy, which President Donald Trump introduced in January 2019 and his successor, Joe Biden, suspended on his first day in office. Mayorkas ended the policy\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.dhs.gov\\/sites\\/default\\/files\\/publications\\/21_0601_termination_of_mpp_program.pdf\\\">in June<\\/a>\\u00a0after an internal review, saying it achieved \\u201cmixed effectiveness.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Illegal border crossings\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.cbp.gov\\/newsroom\\/stats\\/southwest-land-border-encounters\\\">fell sharply\\u00a0<\\/a>after Mexico, facing Trump\\u2019s threat of higher tariffs, acquiesced in 2019 to the policy\\u2019s rapid expansion.

Still, he said benefits do not outweigh costs in terms of relations with Mexico, resources and risks associated with exposure to violence while waiting in Mexican border cities.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201c(There) are inherent problems with the program that no amount of resources can sufficiently fix.\\u201d he wrote. \\\"Others cannot be addressed without detracting from key Administration priorities and more enduring solutions.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the states of Texas and Missouri.

My colleague and I are working on a story about false or misleading vaccine misinformation in the audio space ... You have said on Facebook that the vaccine \'doesn\'t work\' and is \'a complete failure.\' Do you have any comment?\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"fulltext\":\"\\r\\n<p>I want to share my response to The New York Times:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Sure, I have a comment. Every word I say is based on science and facts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the only present scientific way of measuring deaths and injuries from any vaccine \\u2014 including the COVID-19 vaccine. It\'s not my system. It\'s not based on politics. It has nothing to do with conservative or liberal opinions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is a science-based medical reporting system provided by the government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is the only way of keeping track of deaths, crippling injuries and adverse reactions from any vaccine. It has been used for many decades.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>No one in the medical community or media has EVER in history ignored or disparaged VAERS before \\u2014 until now.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Here are the VAERS numbers: Over 17,000 Americans are reported dead from this vaccine \\u2014 mostly from strokes, heart attacks and blood clots. Over 800,000 are reported injured, many of them hospitalized (over 83,000), many with life-threatening illness (over 18,000) and many others permanently disabled (over 26,000).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This information is all publicly available and provided by the CDC. This cannot be called \\\"misleading\\\" by anyone in the media. The very definition of \\\"misleading\\\" would be to either disparage or ignore VAERS and not report on it daily to your readers.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The number of deaths and significant injuries reported to VAERS is now dramatically higher than in the past 30-plus years combined. This has happened in only 10 months.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>That\'s a fact. Facts cannot be \\\"misleading.\\\"<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Several times in America\'s recent history, the medical community has suspended or canceled a vaccine program over a small number of deaths. The first rule of medicine is \\\"physician do no harm.\\\" At any sign of harm, a vaccine should and must be questioned and\\/or suspended.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Never before have we even imagined a vaccine would be linked to over 17,000 deaths and over 800,000 adverse reactions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Yet, the official VAERS numbers have been blacked out from the mainstream media and social media \\u2014 including your New York Times. Any time something is not discussed or debated and is disparaged as \\\"misleading\\\" because it is different from the official government narrative, I\'d call that the very definition of \\\"intolerance\\\" at best, and tyranny at worst.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Even more facts and SCIENCE ...<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Studies are in from many countries, but in particular the U.K. and Israel, reporting:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>No. 1: The vaccine is in fact failing miserably \\u2014 a huge majority of recent cases, hospitalizations and deaths are among double vaccinated individuals. FACT.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>No. 2: Cases are slightly higher in countries with higher vaccination rates, and slightly lower in countries with lower vaccination rates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>These are factual, credible, scientific studies from multiple countries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So yes, I question this vaccine, and yes, I am seriously worried about the proven deaths and injuries directly from this vaccine in the short term (as seen on the VAERS reporting system), and I\'m especially worried about the long-term effects of this vaccine.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If The New York Times believes anything I\'ve said is \\\"misleading,\\\" then you clearly don\'t understand the definition of \\\"science.\\\" I\'m quoting only government, CDC and scientific studies from multiple countries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>More importantly, the very definition of \\\"science\\\" is asking questions and debating.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To not ask questions, especially in the face of so many Americans sick with COVID-19 who are double vaccinated, and so many dead or injured directly from the vaccine as reported by VAERS, would make someone either naive, gullible, blind, deaf or very dumb.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>I\'m proud that my time at Columbia University taught me to think critically, ask questions, never accept as fact what any government agency or authority figure says and always be a fearless debater.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>By the way, I urge The New York Times to set up a debate on this topic. I\'ll be thrilled to debate any \\\"expert\\\" about this particular COVID-19 vaccine and the facts reported by VAERS and studies around the world. Let\'s do it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>WAR<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Wayne Allyn Root<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>P.S. After I sent this response, it was reported 77.7% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois last week were among vaccinated people. It was also reported Ireland has a massive COVID-19 outbreak, despite the country being 91% vaccinated.

As a result, no confirmation of the virus\\u2019 existence can be found. The logical, common sense, and scientific consequences of this fact are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>the structure and composition of something not shown to exist can\\u2019t be known, including the presence, structure, and function of any hypothetical spike or other proteins;<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the genetic sequence of something that has never been found can\\u2019t be known;<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>\\u201cvariants\\u201d of something that hasn\\u2019t been shown to exist can\\u2019t be known;<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>it\\u2019s impossible to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease called Covid-19.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In as concise terms as possible, here\\u2019s the proper way to isolate, characterize and demonstrate a new virus. First, one takes samples (blood, sputum, secretions) from many people (e.g. 500) with symptoms which are unique and specific enough to characterize an illness. Without mixing these samples with ANY tissue or products that also contain genetic material, the virologist macerates, filters and ultracentrifuges i.e.\\u00a0<i>purifies<\\/i>\\u00a0the specimen. This common virology technique, done for decades to isolate bacteriophages<sup>1<\\/sup>\\u00a0and so-called giant viruses in every virology lab, then allows the virologist to demonstrate with electron microscopy thousands of identically sized and shaped particles. These particles are the isolated and purified virus.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>These identical particles are then checked for uniformity by physical and\\/or microscopic techniques. Once the purity is determined, the particles may be further characterized. This would include examining the structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the particles. Next, their genetic makeup is characterized by extracting the genetic material directly from the purified particles and using genetic-sequencing techniques, such as Sanger sequencing, that have also been around for decades. Then one does an analysis to confirm that these uniform particles are exogenous (outside) in origin as a virus is conceptualized to be, and not the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues.<sup>2<\\/sup>\\u00a0(As of May 2020, we know that virologists have no way to determine whether the particles they\\u2019re seeing are viruses or just normal break-down products of dead and dying tissues.)<sup>3<\\/sup>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-element elementor-element-1e8edf5 ob-harakiri-inherit elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\\\" data-id=\\\"1e8edf5\\\" data-element_type=\\\"widget\\\" data-settings=\\\"{&quot;_ob_harakiri_writing_mode&quot;:&quot;inherit&quot;,&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\\\" data-widget_type=\\\"text-editor.default\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-widget-container\\\">\\r\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\\\">\\r\\n<p><em><sup>1<\\/sup>\\u00a0Isolation, characterization and analysis of bacteriophages from the haloalkaline lake Elmenteita, KenyaJuliah Khayeli Akhwale et al, PLOS One, Published: April 25, 2019.\\u00a0<a title=\\\"https:\\/\\/journals.plos.org\\/plosone\\/article?id=10.1371\\/journal.pone.0215734\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/journals.plos.org\\/plosone\\/article?id=10.1371\\/journal.pone.0215734\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">https:\\/\\/journals.plos.org\\/plosone\\/article?id=10.1371\\/journal.pone.0215734<\\/a>\\u00a0\\u2014 accessed 2\\/15\\/21<\\/em><br \\/><em><sup>2<\\/sup>\\u00a0\\u201cExtracellular Vesicles Derived From Apoptotic Cells: An Essential Link Between Death and Regeneration,\\u201d Maojiao Li1 et al, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2020 October 2.\\u00a0<a title=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/fcell.2020.573511\\/full\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/fcell.2020.573511\\/full\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/fcell.2020.573511\\/full<\\/a>\\u00a0\\u2014 accessed 2\\/15\\/21<\\/em><br \\/><em><sup>3<\\/sup>\\u00a0\\u201cThe Role of Extracellular Vesicles as Allies of HIV, HCV and SARS Viruses,\\u201d Flavia Giannessi, et al, Viruses, 2020 May<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n<\\/div>\\r\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-element elementor-element-c0ceae5 elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\\\" data-id=\\\"c0ceae5\\\" data-element_type=\\\"widget\\\" data-settings=\\\"{&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\\\" data-widget_type=\\\"divider.default\\\">If we have come this far then we have fully isolated, characterized, and genetically sequenced an exogenous virus particle.

Then why isn\\u2019t it possible to find it?<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, questioning these virology techniques and conclusions is not some distraction or divisive issue. Shining the light on this truth is essential to stop this terrible fraud that humanity is confronting.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\\\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\\n\\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.          I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind.
