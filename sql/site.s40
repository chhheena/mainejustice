Then, once they get it, they think the only chance they have to beat it is surgery, chemotherapy and', 'radiation treatments. That&#8217;s the absolute worst choice they could ever make. Other people know they can avoid cancer entirely if they filter chemicals and known carcinogens from their daily intake, including what they eat, drink, put on their body and inhale.</p>\n<p>Yet, there&#8217;s far more to it than all that, and these days, if you don&#8217;t know the <a href=\"http://cancercriminals.com\">top 8 causes of cancer</a> that aren&#8217;t generally on the radar of health advocates, then you might be heading down a dark corridor that you could change right now. What will you do? Knowledge is power, so dig right in and then do something about it.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cancer attacks weakened tissue, and the toxic spike proteins from COVID-19 &#8220;vaccines&#8221; limit blood, oxygen and nutrient supply to cells and organs</strong></h3>\n<p>In the Art of War, a commander of forces is wise to cut off the supply lines of the enemy, which weakens them immensely and opens up multiple locations for attack. For Big Pharma, there is no better way of cutting off the &#8220;supply lines&#8221; for humans than injecting billions of sticky prions into the vascular system, and waiting for <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-05-covid-vaccine-spike-proteins-destroy-dna-repair.html\">cancer to spread and attack</a> all the choked out &#8220;regions&#8221; (vital organs, the heart, the brain, the liver, etc).</p>\n<p>Cancer is best described as an uncontrolled replication of mutated cells that attack healthy cells and shut down organs. The COVID-19 mRNA jabs create an uncontrolled, unlimited amount of toxic, virus-mimicking, <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-16-spike-protein-syndrome-is-sweeping-america.html\">spike protein prions</a>, by the millions, that travel throughout the vascular system, clogging up arteries and veins while robbing all systems of oxygen and nutrients. This is the ultimate environment for cancer cells to accumulate and take over.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like cancer of the lymph or blood, but it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-05-top-10-aliases-covid-vaccine-induced-injuries.html\">spike protein syndrome</a> AND cancer. Couple that with several other ways cancer is invading humans, even the ones who filtered out some known cancer causing agents, and you have an exponentially-catapulted cancer crisis happening now across the planet.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>How many of these 8 causes of cancer do you NOT K</strong><strong>NOW</strong><strong> about yet?</strong>\n</h3>\n<p>#1. The COVID-19 spike-protein &#8220;vaccines&#8221;</p>\n<p>#2. Nicotine gum</p>\n<p>#3. Chemotherapy</p>\n<p>#4. Cosmetics</p>\n<p>#5. Hair dyes</p>\n<p>#6. Sunscreen lotions</p>\n<p>#7. Fragrances &#8211; air fresheners, perfumes, colognes</p>\n<p>#8. Cell phone radiation (5G) and other &#8220;dirty energy&#8221;</p>\n<h3><strong>Cancerous sugar, cancerous &#8220;treatments,&#8221; cancerous &#8216;care&#8217; products and cancerous phones – the attack on your cells is relentless</strong></h3>\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;re trying to quit smoking and you chew nicotine gum. Did you know nearly all brands of nicotine gum contain synthetic, <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/046808_cancer_cigarettes_GMOs.html\">lab-concocted artificial sweeteners</a> that cause cancer, just like the cigarettes you&#8217;re quitting? Possibly even faster. Trading lung cancer for pancreatic cancer won&#8217;t do you any good.</p>\n<p>Did someone you know get cancer, go to the &#8220;best oncology center&#8221; in the region and get the &#8220;best care possible&#8221; but still die from cancer? Guess what? They probably died from the chemotherapy. Chemotherapy actually spreads the cancer and creates new cancers throughout the body, like spike proteins from Fauci Flu shots.</p>\n<p>Did you know your skin is your biggest organ? So why cover it with cancer-causing agents that are found in the majority of <a href=\"https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/known-carcinogens/\">conventional cosmetics</a>, sunscreen lotions, bug-off sprays, hair dyes (go into your scalp), perfumes, colognes, deodorants, antiperspirant, lip balm, powders (talc) and creams? Yes, watch out for sodium laurel sulfate, formaldehyde, urea (animal urine), benzene, parabens, triclosan, coal tar, ethylene oxide, heavy metals, arsenic and much more.</p>\n<p>Got your cell phone next to your head for minutes or even hours? Stop. At least put it on speaker or use blue tooth, because the <a href=\"https://greenwavefilters.com/cancer-and-dirty-electricity/\">dirty energy</a> is contributing to cancer, including links to leukemia, brain tumors and breast cancer. Exposure to EMFs is increasing for humans by the day.

The mill is surrounded by the county courthouse as well as businesses and homes.</p>\n<p>The fire was reportedly caused by mechanical failure that may be related to a sifter’s filter. Police Chief Charles Byram said: &#8220;It happened in the mill itself, with one of the pieces of equipment, with a rubber bushing or housing that obviously got too hot and started the fire.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were no injuries, but some buildings in the immediate area sustained smoke and water damage. The mill had been processing a significant amount of flour as the fire occurred right in the middle of harvest season.</p>\n<p>Although an exact figure was not available, employees of the mill have estimated that there were “hundreds of thousands of pounds of processed flour in the bins.” An estimated cost of the damages is not yet available.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The company is now working with Pacific Northwest wheat farmers to handle the excess supply. Although they have never disclosed the building&#8217;s production capacity and it is difficult to determine the full extent of the damage, the president of the Oregon Wheat Growers League, Ben Maney, said that a substantial number of area farmers bring their grain to the facility, which he described as a staple in the Pendleton community.</p>\n<h2>Fire yet another hit for struggling wheat farmers</h2>\n<p>Maney said the fire is just the latest hit for growers who are still struggling after the severe drought of last year. Some crops rebounded thanks to the spring rains this year, but many farmers lack home storage for their grain and relied on the mill.</p>\n<p>He noted: &#8220;A lot of farmers don&#8217;t have home storage, and they can&#8217;t store that grain on their farm. For this heartbreaking event to happen today, it puts the community and a lot of the farmers in a tough situation. It hits the community hard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The farmer-owned flour company Shepherd’s Grain emailed customers to inform them of an interruption in flour supply as they work on a contingency plan and get wheat staged to be moved to another mill.</p>\n<p>Byram pointed out that the fire will have a big impact on Pendleton, stating: &#8220;They&#8217;re a major employer; we are obviously an agricultural community that does a lot of dryland wheat farming. Wheat farmers from the surrounding area bring their wheat in here to the Pendleton flour mill. It&#8217;s yet to be determined what the impact is, but I can gauge it&#8217;s going to be significant.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oregonbusiness.com/article/farms-forests/item/19625-fire-destroys-pendleton-flour-mill\">mill makes flour</a> for several types of foods, including tortillas and pizza.

The ensuing Russian strikes in populated areas have killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure,” the report said, adding that the results of this were Russian attacks on said civilian infrastructure, Zero Hedge reported, adding:</p>\n<p><em>The report detailed further that in 22 of 29 schools visited by an Amnesty team between April and July, investigators found evidence of prior military activity. Additionally, five instances of Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases were documented. The report went so far as to stress Amnesty was “not aware” of instances where Ukrainian troops first tried to evacuate civilians from these locations.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>“Not every Russian attack documented by Amnesty has followed this pattern. In certain locations in which Amnesty concluded that Russia had committed war crimes – including in some areas of the city of Kharkiv – Amnesty did not find evidence of Ukrainian forces located in civilian areas unlawfully targeted by the Russian military,” the report noted.</p>\n<p>These truths have upset Western globalists.</p>\n<p>“This report by @amnesty International is such a disgrace. It only amplifies the narratives of the Russian #propaganda targeted against #Ukraine. With this one, AI has hit the bottom,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StZaryn/status/1555253262462451714\">tweeted the spokesman for the Polish Minister-Coordinator of Special Services</a>, Stanislaw Zaryn.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba <a href=\"https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/08/04/ukrainian-officials-slam-amnestys-international-accusations-of-ukrainian-army/\">was also very quick to rip the AI report</a>: “I understand that Amnesty will respond to criticism by saying that they criticize both sides of the conflict. But such behavior on Amnesty’s part is not about looking for the truth and presenting it to the world, but about creating a false balance between the criminal and his victim.”</p>\n<p>Other commentators claimed that the organization was engaged in “victim-blaming” — which is true, to an extent, but also very accurate, given the findings listed in the report.</p>\n<p>“Amnesty International blames Ukrainian defenders for protecting civilians from attacks by Russian invaders. ‘Blame the victim’ false equivalency reflects the moral void at the heart of @amnesty. It’s a disgrace to people of conscience who value the protection of human rights,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhmck/status/1555243668201676800\">one of them noted on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnès Callamard said that her organization was under extreme pressure not to point any fingers at Kyiv, but she noted nevertheless: “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.”</p>\n<p>And her organization is <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/ukraine-military-endangering-civilians-locating-forces-residential-areas-new\">not backing down one iota from its report</a>.</p>\n<p>Initially, AI told the media that it “deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the <a href=\"http://ukrainewitness.com\">Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused</a>.”</p>\n<p>But, Amnesty went on to emphasize that the organization&#8217;s “sole objective” in publishing the report was to ensure that “civilians are protected.”</p>\n<p>The group made it clear that it “fully stand[s] by our findings&#8221; &#8212; so in other words, &#8216;sorry, not sorry.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Russia invaded Ukraine, that much is known. But the Russian troops are certainly not the only ones who have committed atrocities regarding civilians, as AI accurately pointed out.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-amnesty-international-angers-west-ukrainian-war-crimes.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/ukraine-military-endangering-civilians-locating-forces-residential-areas-new\">Amnesty.org.uk</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amnesty-international-refuses-to-apologize-western-leaders.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Amnesty International refuses to apologize to Western leaders for report revealing human rights abuses by Ukrainian forces\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amnesty-international-refuses-to-apologize-western-leaders.html&linkname=Amnesty%20International%20refuses%20to%20apologize%20to%20Western%20leaders%20for%20report%20revealing%20human%20rights%20abuses%20by%20Ukrainian%20forces\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amnesty-international-refuses-to-apologize-western-leaders.html&linkname=Amnesty%20International%20refuses%20to%20apologize%20to%20Western%20leaders%20for%20report%20revealing%20human%20rights%20abuses%20by%20Ukrainian%20forces\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amnesty-international-refuses-to-apologize-western-leaders.html&linkname=Amnesty%20International%20refuses%20to%20apologize%20to%20Western%20leaders%20for%20report%20revealing%20human%20rights%20abuses%20by%20Ukrainian%20forces\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amnesty-international-refuses-to-apologize-western-leaders.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 05:46:05', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '159', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

A third man, salesperson Jeffrey Ruffo, was also charged but almost entirely acquitted.</p>\n<p>Nowak and Smith engaged in illegal &#8220;spoofing,&#8221; which involves the use of computer algorithms that disrupt normal trading activity for manipulation purposes. In essence, spoofing creates artificial pricing for assets, in this case precious metals.</p>\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s most aggressive case to date targeting spoofing, the ruling saw Nowak get convicted on 13 other charges as well including fraud and attempted market manipulation. Smith was convicted on 11 charges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ruffo, who was only charged with racketeering and conspiracy, was acquitted of both, the attorneys said,&#8221; reported <i>CNBC</i> (Related: Back in June, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-02-jpmorgan-dimon-economic-hurricane-landfall-america.html\" target=\"_blank\">warned about</a> a soon-to-come &#8220;economic hurricane.&#8221;)</p>\n<h2>Central banks like the Federal Reserve actively manipulate metals markets</h2>\n<p>For those directly involved in the metals markets, it is no secret that gold and silver are highly manipulated. The price for the actual commodities is skewed because of paper trading – meaning the trading of metals that may only exist on a screen and not in real life.</p>\n<p>The Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) confirmed this in a ruling against investment bank Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc. (MLCI), which was caught spoofing the price of gold and silver futures contracts on the COMEX exchange.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number of investigations, legal cases, class actions and financial headlines involving precious metals manipulation are now so pervasive that it&#8217;s hard to keep track of which cases are in motion and which investment banks are under scrutiny at any given time,&#8221; reported <i>Bullion Star</i> back in 2019.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But beyond the profit and greed driven bullion bank manipulations gold and silver prices, there is also the issue of central bank policy interventions to suppress the gold price by outright gold sales or using the opaque and secretive gold leasing and lending market. This is a less talked about manipulation given the secrecy of everything to do with central banks and gold, as well as a reluctance of the financial media to broach the subject and a reluctance of regulators to &#8216;go there&#8217; by even looking at central bank gold market activities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While it might seem encouraging for these JPMorgan goons to finally get what was coming to them, they are just the patsies, so to speak, in a much greater system of financial fraud that continues to dominate the world.</p>\n<p>Until the big boys are finally held accountable for their crimes of financial terrorism against <i>We the People</i>, these convictions are mere stage play meant to pacify us all into thinking that there is still some semblance of justice in this country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Apart from fractional-reserve banking, precious metals market structure is perhaps one of the biggest cons on the planet,&#8221; <i>Bullion Star</i> added. &#8220;So next time you think of precious metals manipulation, remember that in addition to spoofing and secretive central bank gold loans, the entire structure of the precious metals markets is unfortunately one big manipulation hiding in plain sight.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The silver lining in all this is that <i>divine</i> justice is coming for the pervasive evil that currently rules the world. They might think they have it in the bag and won, but they have something entirely different coming to them very soon.</p>\n<p>As the current economic order implodes on itself, we will keep you informed about the latest at <a href=\"http://marketcrash.news\" target=\"_blank\">MarketCrash.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/mgVW9\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-02-jpmorgan-dimon-economic-hurricane-landfall-america.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/gold-silver-price-manipulation-the-greatest-trick-ever-pulled/#:~:text=That%20prices%20in%20the%20precious%20metals%20markets%20are,and%20silver%20futures%20contracts%20on%20the%20COMEX%20exchange.\" target=\"_blank\">BullionStar.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-metals-traders-jpmorgan-guilty-spoofing-manipulation-fraud.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Former metals traders at JPMorgan found guilty in landmark “spoofing” case, PROVING that precious metals prices are rigged\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-metals-traders-jpmorgan-guilty-spoofing-manipulation-fraud.html&linkname=Former%20metals%20traders%20at%20JPMorgan%20found%20guilty%20in%20landmark%20%E2%80%9Cspoofing%E2%80%9D%20case%2C%20PROVING%20that%20precious%20metals%20prices%20are%20rigged\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-metals-traders-jpmorgan-guilty-spoofing-manipulation-fraud.html&linkname=Former%20metals%20traders%20at%20JPMorgan%20found%20guilty%20in%20landmark%20%E2%80%9Cspoofing%E2%80%9D%20case%2C%20PROVING%20that%20precious%20metals%20prices%20are%20rigged\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-metals-traders-jpmorgan-guilty-spoofing-manipulation-fraud.html&linkname=Former%20metals%20traders%20at%20JPMorgan%20found%20guilty%20in%20landmark%20%E2%80%9Cspoofing%E2%80%9D%20case%2C%20PROVING%20that%20precious%20metals%20prices%20are%20rigged\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-metals-traders-jpmorgan-guilty-spoofing-manipulation-fraud.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 05:38:02', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '158', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

However, she was under the influence of cocaine and possibly fentanyl.</p>\n<p>The 53-year-old actress, who is known for', 'her roles in movies such as <em>Six Days, Seven Nights</em> and <em>Donnie Brasco</em>, as well as the soap opera <em>Another World</em>, made headlines last week when she <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/entertainment/anne-heche-had-cocaine-her-193758847.html\">crashed her vehicle</a> into a car and then a garage. A witness tried to help, but she raced off and then plowed through a hedge and finally crashed into a house, causing a fire that left her with severe burns and burned a woman’s home to the ground. It took 59 firefighters to get her out of the wreckage in what was her third car crash within a span of 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Photos emerged from the first incident that appeared to show a bottle of alcohol in the cup holder of her car, while Heche appeared glassy-eyed. However, according to sources from the Los Angeles Police Department, tests on blood that was drawn after she was admitted to the hospital found the presence of cocaine as well as fentanyl rather than alcohol.</p>\n<p>However, experts note that fentanyl is sometimes <a href=\"http://prescriptiondrugs.news\">administered to patients as a pain medication</a> in hospitals. Therefore, further testing is needed to determine whether fentanyl was already in her system ahead of the crash or if it had been given to her to address the severe pain she must have experienced as a result of her extensive burns.</p>\n<p>Footage of the moments before the crash showed her speeding down an alley and narrowly missing a pedestrian who was walking down a sidewalk. She was reportedly driving faster than 90 miles per hour at the time of the crash.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>An LAPD spokesperson told <em>ET</em> that she is being investigated for felony traffic DUI, adding: &#8220;Right now, what has been found is a presence of narcotics in her system, however additional testing is required because we have to rule out additional substances administered at the hospital.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Not expected to survive</h2>\n<p>Her condition is considered dire and has not improved since she was first admitted to the Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital. According to her representative, she suffered from a catastrophic brain injury shortly after her crash and is not expected to survive. A statement says that she suffered from a severe anoxic brain injury and is still in a coma. The actress had expressed a desire to be an organ donor, so she is currently being kept alive with life support while doctors determine if any of her organs are viable.</p>\n<h2>A lifetime of mental health struggles</h2>\n<p>Heche suffered from mental health problems throughout her life. She said that her father repeatedly raped her throughout her childhood, giving her genital herpes. He died when she was 13 of HIV/AIDS, and her brother died in a car accident three months later in an accident that Heche has said she believes was suicide.</p>\n<p>She has stated that she felt like she was “insane” for most of her life and created a fantasy world to make herself feel safe in which she had an alter ego named Celestia who could contact extraterrestrials. Her lifelong mental health struggles were the subject of her 2001 memoir, and it appears that she was still struggling at the time of her potentially deadly accident.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many Americans suffering from trauma and other mental health issues never get the support and treatment they need, with many doctors simply writing prescriptions for profitable <a href=\"https://psychdrugs.news/\">antidepressants and antipsychotics</a> rather than ensuring people get the therapy they need to find true peace.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources for this article include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aol.com/entertainment/anne-heche-had-cocaine-her-193758847.html\">AOL.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2022/08/11/anne-heche-under-influence-cocaine-fentanyl-car-crash-house-condition/\">TMZ.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-actress-heche-cocaine-in-system-during-crash.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Actress Anne Heche had cocaine in her system during fiery car crash (UPDATE: She has now died)\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-actress-heche-cocaine-in-system-during-crash.html&linkname=Actress%20Anne%20Heche%20had%20cocaine%20in%20her%20system%20during%20fiery%20car%20crash%20%28UPDATE%3A%20She%20has%20now%20died%29\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-actress-heche-cocaine-in-system-during-crash.html&linkname=Actress%20Anne%20Heche%20had%20cocaine%20in%20her%20system%20during%20fiery%20car%20crash%20%28UPDATE%3A%20She%20has%20now%20died%29\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-actress-heche-cocaine-in-system-during-crash.html&linkname=Actress%20Anne%20Heche%20had%20cocaine%20in%20her%20system%20during%20fiery%20car%20crash%20%28UPDATE%3A%20She%20has%20now%20died%29\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-actress-heche-cocaine-in-system-during-crash.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 05:29:05', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '157', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Twitter prohibited him from posting unless he deleted a tweet that purportedly linked the monkeypox outbreak to the COVID-19 vaccines. (Related: <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-10-israeli-doctor-monkeypox-covid-jabs-censored-twitter.html\">Israeli doctor who linked monkeypox outbreak to covid jabs CENSORED by Twitter.</a>)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Monkeypox cases were rare for years. During the last [year], a single case was documented in Israel,&#8221; Shapira wrote in the flagged tweet. &#8220;It is well established [that] the mRNA vaccines [against COVID-19] affect the natural immune system. A monkeypox outbreak following massive COVID-19 vaccination is not a coincidence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Israeli scientist himself had suffered vaccine injuries in May after being injected with the COVID-19 vaccine, lending credence to his tweet about the risks of the mRNA shot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I received three vaccinations, [and] I was physically injured in a very significant way as many others were injured,&#8221; he tweeted on May 14.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition, my trust in the nature of the decisions and the process of making them has been severely eroded. No one asked and checked. I will fight with all my might so that truthful answers regarding all decisions, and not just regarding the vaccines, are given.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Shapira keeps on tweeting the truth about the COVID-19 vaccines</h2>\n<p>Shapira&#8217;s background is no joke, given his extensive medical experience. He formerly served as the director general of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) from 2013 to 2021. The professor also led the country&#8217;s efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, spearheading the initiative until his departure from the IIBR in May 2021.</p>\n<p>Shapira tweeted in June that he &#8220;will continue [to] ask why [authorities would] give an outdated fifth vaccine [dose] that does not prevent disease and apparently <a href=\"http://vaccineinjurynews.com\">causes many significant and common side effects</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When misunderstandings and doubts that are difficult to deal with are raised, they start preaching morals [and] slanders. It&#8217;s &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; to Your Honor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A month later, on July 28, the professor mentioned Twitter&#8217;s warning in a post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[Twitter] warned me to remove the [tweet] connecting monkeypox to COVID-19. Each day, I understand better [the] year in which we live.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence expert Dr. Eli David commented on the social media site&#8217;s censorship of the Israeli expert. He wrote: &#8220;Twitter locked his account and forced him to delete [the offending tweet]. They know more about biology than him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The victory will be ours.

For Dollar General, the number of shopper visits grew by 4.1 percent.</p>\n<p>Overall, Placer.ai, a location analytics firm, said foot traffic to discount stores like Aldi, Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree grew by eight percent during the second quarter year-over-year and jumped 13.2 percent compared with the first quarter of 2022.</p>\n<p>According to Numerator, a consumer insights firm, Walmart shoppers have a median household income of $73,000 annually. Meanwhile, Dollar General&#8217;s core demographic is families making $40,000 or less per year.</p>\n<p>Due to the sudden influx of new, higher-earning customers, Dollar General has widened its product selection to reflect the increase in sales outside of its core demographic.</p>\n<h2>Fuel prices keeping Americans at discount stores</h2>\n<p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had previously characterized the retail chain as an &#8220;inflation-fighter&#8221; and a top destination for shoppers during recessionary periods. But Walmart&#8217;s share as the first choice of consumers for grocery purchases dropped from 27.4 percent in June to 25.5 percent in July as more Americans turn to discount stores.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p><em>Reuters&#8217;</em> analysis noted that gasoline prices may be one of the main reasons keeping Walmart&#8217;s former customers from returning to the big-box store.</p>\n<p>Gasoline prices in June soared to an average of $5 per gallon, up from around $3.16 per gallon last year. Higher gas prices are shaving hundreds of dollars off the monthly spending budgets of Americans, forcing many to change their spending habits.</p>\n<p>For July, monthly spending on gas rose to around 5.57 percent of the income of a typical American household – which earns an average of $5,412 per month after taxes. This is up from gas spending only consisting of 2.79 percent of household budgets in Dec. 2019.</p>\n<p>McMillon told investors that Walmart shoppers – especially those belonging to lower-income households – have been purchasing fewer items during the three months through April 30. They have also been consolidating their trips to the store in response to higher fuel prices.</p>\n<p>Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager for the Roosevelt Investment Group, noted that while Walmart&#8217;s main advantage is in its ability to offer a larger selection of goods, the convenient locations of dollar stores offer a significant advantage, especially as fuel prices remain high. While Walmart only has around 5,300 stores in the U.S., Dollar General operates more than 18,400 stores.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The driving distance for a typical shopper across much of the U.S. may be twice as far to reach the nearest Walmart as compared to a dollar store,&#8221; said Benowitz.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how inflation is changing Americans&#8217; spending habits at <a href=\"https://inflation.news/\">Inflation.news</a>.</p>\n<p>Watch this episode of the &#8220;Health Ranger Report&#8221; as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger talks about how more Americans <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/4cbf1ed8-32ce-43ec-86f8-20f849993857\">are shifting food shopping to dollar stores</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport\">Health Ranger Report channel on </a><em><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport\">Brighteon.com</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>More related articles:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://inflation.news/2022-08-02-americans-relying-on-dollar-stores-worsening-inflation.html\">Americans relying more and more on DOLLAR STORES as inflation worsens</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foodinflation.news/2022-07-28-americans-turn-to-cheaper-store-brands-inflation.html\">American consumers turn to cheaper store brands as commodity prices continue to soar</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://inflation.news/2022-07-27-americans-having-difficulties-covering-household-expenses-inflation.html\">Record number of Americans having difficulties covering household expenses as inflation crisis continues</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collapse.news/2022-07-25-dollar-stores-winning-americans-lose-to-inflation.html\">Analysis: Dollar stores are WINNING as Americans lose to inflation</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-14-american-workers-lost-3400-yearly-income-inflation.html\">American workers have lost $3,400 in yearly income due to unrelenting inflation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2022/08/traffic-walmart-plunges-bidens-inflation-makes-even-discounter-expensive/\">WND.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/walmarts-long-lasting-challenge-luring-budget-shoppers-back-its-stores-2022-08-11/\">Reuters.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/4cbf1ed8-32ce-43ec-86f8-20f849993857\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walmart-losing-customers-inflation-dollar-stores.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Walmart continues to lose customers as inflation forces Americans to turn to dollar stores\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walmart-losing-customers-inflation-dollar-stores.html&linkname=Walmart%20continues%20to%20lose%20customers%20as%20inflation%20forces%20Americans%20to%20turn%20to%20dollar%20stores\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walmart-losing-customers-inflation-dollar-stores.html&linkname=Walmart%20continues%20to%20lose%20customers%20as%20inflation%20forces%20Americans%20to%20turn%20to%20dollar%20stores\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walmart-losing-customers-inflation-dollar-stores.html&linkname=Walmart%20continues%20to%20lose%20customers%20as%20inflation%20forces%20Americans%20to%20turn%20to%20dollar%20stores\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walmart-losing-customers-inflation-dollar-stores.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 04:50:02', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '155', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

According to the police union head, drug dealers in his country have become so influential that they contend with the official economy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I call the Netherlands a narco-state 2.0 because drugs pump so much money into the legal economy that it takes over. It undermines democracy but also the economy,&#8221; Struijs said.</p>\n<p>The Netherlands is often lauded by left-liberals for its drug decriminalization policies, but this allowed the illicit drug trade to flourish. According to <em>SVT</em>, the large illegal drug black economy has influenced several parts of the formal economy of the Netherlands. Even housing prices and some companies that manage legal businesses have not been spared from big-time drug dealers.</p>\n<p>Besides influencing the economy, <a href=\"http://violence.news\">drug trafficking groups have also intimidated and murdered</a> journalists and lawyers in the past few years.</p>\n<p>Dutch veteran crime journalist Peter R. de Vries was shot in July 2021 on the streets of Amsterdam and died a few days later. Prior to his death, De Vries served as an adviser for a witness in an important crime gang trial dubbed the Marengo trial.</p>\n<p>Lawyer Derk Wiersum, who represented a key witness in the Marengo trial, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50821542\">was also shot dead in broad daylight</a> in 2019. Assailants killed the 44-year-old attorney and father of two children in front of his wife, while outside their home in a peaceful Amsterdam suburb. Wiersum&#8217;s murder was seen as an attack on civil society, democracy and the rule of law.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The Marengo trial involved the Mocro Mafia and its leader Ridouan Taghi. The Moroccan-born Taghi was arrested in Dubai in 2019 and extradited to the Netherlands. Judicial proceedings for the 43-year-old crime bigwig, presently incarcerated at a high-security prison in the southern town of Vught, commenced in March 2021.</p>\n<h2>Mocro Mafia handles a third of cocaine traffic in entire Europe</h2>\n<p>Even though Taghi is already behind bars, several of those who have testified at his trial have asked that they remain anonymous – fearing retaliation from the Mocro Mafia.</p>\n<p>Founded in the 1990s, <a href=\"https://www.nationandstate.com/2022/08/08/holland-has-become-narco-state-2-0-police-union-chief/\">the group is composed</a> of dozens of various clans that traffic cocaine and synthetic drugs throughout Europe. Its name comes from the Dutch slur &#8220;Mocro&#8221; which was used for people of Moroccan descent living in Belgium and the Netherlands. The group&#8217;s motto is the Dutch phrase &#8220;Wie praat, die gatt&#8221; or &#8220;Whoever talks, dies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It initially started by smuggling hashish – derived from marijuana – from Morocco to Europe. However, Taghi eschewed hashish for cocaine, which enabled the Mocro Mafia&#8217;s rise to become one of the most powerful trafficking cartels in Belgium and the Netherlands in the 2010s. Currently, the group still operates out of the two countries and handles a third of cocaine traffic in the continent.</p>\n<p>The Mocro Mafia developed direct ties with cartels in Colombia and Mexico to smuggle cocaine through the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam. Police drug hauls at the ports have become completely normal that even the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation now views Belgium and the Netherlands to be the headquarters of cocaine trafficking in Europe.</p>\n<p>Aside from drugs, Taghi&#8217;s group also made a name for itself through violence. Almost 20 people were killed between 2012 and 2016, amid the so-called Mocro Mafia War. Seventeen members of the drug trafficking group were accused of six killings and numerous attempted murders.</p>\n<p>The situation became so dire that in 2021, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was put under police protection for fears that the Mocro Mafia would target him.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://drugcartels.news/\">DrugCartels.news</a> for more news like this.</p>\n<p>Watch the video below to know more about <a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/cecd109f-cf90-487a-8557-25f0ee53804c\">the murder of journalists investigating</a> the Mexican drug cartels.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/channels/the1jeremy\">Excellent PODCASTS &amp; Real NEWS channel on <em>Brighteon.com</em></a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>More related stories:</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2019-06-12-america-is-being-transformed-into-a-dangerous-narco-terrorist-state.html\" target=\"_blank\">America is being transformed into a dangerous narco-terrorist state by design</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2017-04-01-america-collapsed-pharma-state-drug-cartels.html\" target=\"_blank\">America has collapsed into a PHARMA STATE run by government-protected drug cartels</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.drugcartels.news/2022-06-30-credit-suisse-found-guilty-money-laundering.html\">Credit Suisse found guilty of “being unable to prevent” money laundering by drug ring</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/045822_illegal_immigration_Mexican_cartels_drug_smuggling.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mexican drug cartels using illegal immigration flood as cover to smuggle operatives and hard drugs into the U.S.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2020-08-05-china-dominating-global-drug-trafficking-money-laundering.html\" target=\"_blank\">China now dominating global drug trafficking with money laundering and chemical production</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/08/07/police-union-head-netherlands-now-a-narco-state-with-parallel-economy/\">Breitbart.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50821542\">BBC.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nationandstate.com/2022/08/08/holland-has-become-narco-state-2-0-police-union-chief/\">NationAndState.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/cecd109f-cf90-487a-8557-25f0ee53804c\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-police-union-head-netherlands-now-narco-state.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Dutch Police Union head: The Netherlands is now a NARCO-STATE with a parallel economy\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-police-union-head-netherlands-now-narco-state.html&linkname=Dutch%20Police%20Union%20head%3A%20The%20Netherlands%20is%20now%20a%20NARCO-STATE%20with%20a%20parallel%20economy\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-police-union-head-netherlands-now-narco-state.html&linkname=Dutch%20Police%20Union%20head%3A%20The%20Netherlands%20is%20now%20a%20NARCO-STATE%20with%20a%20parallel%20economy\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-police-union-head-netherlands-now-narco-state.html&linkname=Dutch%20Police%20Union%20head%3A%20The%20Netherlands%20is%20now%20a%20NARCO-STATE%20with%20a%20parallel%20economy\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-police-union-head-netherlands-now-narco-state.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 04:36:03', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '154', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

The next day, COMEX reported another drop in registered inventories to 55.7 Moz.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://supplychainwarning.com\">massive drop in silver inventories</a> is happening all over the world. In the Shanghai Stock Exchange, silver inventory reached its peak in Jan. 2021 at 3,091 tons (109 Moz). On July 27, inventory had fallen to just 141 tons (49 Moz).</p>\n<p>In the London vaults of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), comprised of vaults in and around London run by several bullion banks like JPMorgan, HSBC and ICBC Standard Bank, reported that the quantity of silver held in their vaults <a href=\"https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/lbma-silver-inventories-fall-to-a-near-6-year-low-below-1-billion-ounces/\">has been dropping for seven straight months</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest data from the LBMA from the end of June 2022 showed that the vaults only hold 997.4 Moz of silver.

Cochran, who is leading the ISU side of the partnership, said the material is the result of over 12 years of research and experimentation.</p>\n<p>Cochran and the ISU worked with the <em>Iowa Department of Transportation</em> to identify counties in Hinson&#8217;s district that had the type of roads and repair needs that would qualify them for federal funding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a combination of how to showcase the technology, but also put it into practice on rural Iowa roads, which are often overlooked or don&#8217;t receive enough resources to keep up to date,&#8221; said Cochran.</p>\n<p>In an interview with the <em>Telegraph Herald</em>, Cochran reiterated how the soy-based polymer could replace petroleum-based polymers, making it more sustainable.</p>\n<p>He added that future large demand for soy-based recycled asphalt could provide another market for the soybean crops of many Iowa farmers, which are expected to become less profitable in the coming years, as the automobile industry moves more toward producing electric cars.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to have a broad portfolio of end uses for this crop,&#8221; said Cochran. &#8220;Right now, the [soybean] oil is very highly sought after for its fuel value, but there are a lot of industrial uses as well. No matter how much is produced in a given year, being able to satisfy the food value and industrial demand is important.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Learn more about scientific discoveries and breakthroughs at <a href=\"https://breakthrough.news/\">Breakthrough.news</a>.</p>\n<p>Watch this episode of &#8220;The American Journal&#8221; as host Harrison Smith talks about how <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/b628d815-67b6-41b9-920c-c44d5fac1ac8\">America&#8217;s critical infrastructure is collapsing</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/infowarsnetwork\">InfoWars channel on </a><em><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/infowarsnetwork\">Brighteon.com</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>More related stories:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://solarpanels.news/2019-02-10-china-to-build-solar-roadways.html\">China to build &#8220;solar roadways&#8221; with fully transparent concrete covering solar cells</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://breakthrough.news/2019-02-08-sunflower-oil-to-self-heal-potholes.html\">Highway department in England is using SUNFLOWER OIL to &#8220;self heal&#8221; potholes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2017-05-08-futuristic-roads-now-using-recycled-plastic-in-place-of-asphalt-making-them-last-10-times-longer.html\">Futuristic roads now mixing recycled plastic with asphalt making them last 10 times longer</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/044236_asphalt_sealant_cancer_risk_childrens_health.html\">Substance used to seal asphalt puts children at greater risk of cancer</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agweb.com/markets/pro-farmer-analysis/soy-based-asphalt-soon-be-commercially-available\">AgWeb.com<br>\n</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2022/08/09/iowa-makes-roads-out-of-soybeans-and-recycled-asphalt\">Axios.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.telegraphherald.com/news/tri-state/article_da38ec92-b981-5550-a195-31a5fde88a22.html\">TelegraphHerald.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/b628d815-67b6-41b9-920c-c44d5fac1ac8\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-researchers-road-paving-using-soybean-recycled-asphalt.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Plant-based ROADS?

The robot arms designed to replenish drinks in refrigerators are now in mass production, according to the technology firm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;TX SCARA was created', 'to do the specific task of restocking refrigerated shelves with bottles and cans – a repetitive, tedious job generally performed by employees in often uncomfortable settings,&#8221; Telexistence said <a href=\"https://tx-inc.com/en/blog/2022/08/10/11737/\">in an Aug. 10 statement</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;TX SCARA operates 24/7, replenishing shelves to completely remove the task from store staff. The introduction of robots and its AI system will create time surplus without adding employees, and the time can be reallocated to customer service and shop floor enhancement, leading to higher quality work environment and store operations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The robots can work without human assistance 98 percent of the time, with a remote piloting option available in case the <a href=\"http://glitch.news\">artificial intelligence fails</a> or encounters out-of-place items. Each TX SCARA unit can replace one to three hours of daily work by humans in every store where it is deployed. Telexistence said the deployment of the robots served a two-fold purpose: Help relieve store workers and fill a void left by Japan&#8217;s shrinking workforce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decline in Japan&#8217;s labor population is one of the key management issues for FamilyMart to continue stable store operations,&#8221; said the company&#8217;s general manager Tomohiro Kano. He added that the newly created time as a result of adopting TX SCARA &#8220;can be reallocated to customer service and shop floor enhancement.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>FamilyMart, which has 16,000 convenience stores in its home country, will pay Telexistence a monthly fee for the robot stocker&#8217;s labor and maintenance. The fee will also include the support of remote workers who can pilot the TX SCARA unit using a virtual reality headset when needed.</p>\n<h2>Robots also replacing human cooks in fast food chains</h2>\n<p>The trend of robots replacing human workers is not limited to Japan. In fact, restaurants in the U.S. have followed the practice. Layoffs prompted by the pandemic and the inability to fill these job vacancies prompted several companies <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-robots-kitchen-labor-shortage-11628290623\">to turn to robots instead</a>. (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-11-restaurants-look-to-robots-fill-job-openings.html\">Restaurants look to ROBOTS to fill openings amid labor shortage.</a>)</p>\n<p>Fast food chain White Castle was among the companies who jumped on the bandwagon, with its robotic fry cook named Flippy. The robot arm – who mans the fry station in the joint&#8217;s No. 42 branch in Merrillville, Indiana – worked 23 hours a day, with an hour reserved for cleaning and maintenance. Flippy&#8217;s main tasks involve handling fries, cheese sticks, onion rings and other side items.</p>\n<p>According to Jamie Richardson, White Castle&#8217;s vice president of corporate relations, Flippy was not just a gimmick to attract more diners. Its dedicated tasks gave its human colleagues more time to focus on customers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you know you&#8217;ve got the fryer covered, it frees you up to have the right person taking orders in the dining room or the drive-thru,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mexican fast food chain Del Taco followed suit with a machine that fills customers&#8217; drink orders. According to Del Taco&#8217;s Vice President for Operations Innovation Kevin Pope, the machine seeks to automatically prepare a diner&#8217;s chosen drink – shaving seconds off the time needed to fulfill every order.</p>\n<p>The machine takes a cup, fills it with ice and pours in the appropriate beverage afterward. It then covers the cup with a lid and delivers the finished drink at the end of a conveyor belt. Human crew members would only have to grab the drink instead of making it themselves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://robots.news/\">Robots.news</a> has more stories about robots replacing human workers.</p>\n<p>Watch this video about <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/4b9474bc-60e6-4614-b524-6e11d359ab68\">a restaurant in Japan staffed by robots</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/vigilentcitizen\">Vigilent Citizen channel on <em>Brighteon.com</em></a>.</p>\n<h3>More related stories:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://robots.news/2019-01-01-prototype-humanoid-robot-aimed-at-replacing-human-laborers.html\">Japanese researchers develop a prototype humanoid robot aimed at eventually replacing human laborers.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robots.news/2022-04-13-airports-turn-to-robots-for-covid-protocols.html\">RULED BY SILICON: Airports turn to ROBOTS to enforce COVID protocols as air travel normalizes.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robots.news/2018-02-17-robots-automating-harvesting-cucumbers-germany.html\">Robots now automating the harvesting of cucumbers in Germany.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robots.news/2018-02-15-your-barista-is-being-replaced-by-a-robot-already-in-use-in-japan.html\">Your barista is being replaced by a robot, already in use in Japan.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robot-arms-replacing-shelf-stockers-000000755.html\">Finance.Yahoo.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tx-inc.com/en/blog/2022/08/10/11737/\">TX-Inc.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-robots-kitchen-labor-shortage-11628290623\">WSJ.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/4b9474bc-60e6-4614-b524-6e11d359ab68\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-robots-replacing-shelf-stockers-japanese-convenience-store.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Robots replacing shelf stockers in Japanese convenience store chain\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-robots-replacing-shelf-stockers-japanese-convenience-store.html&linkname=Robots%20replacing%20shelf%20stockers%20in%20Japanese%20convenience%20store%20chain\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-robots-replacing-shelf-stockers-japanese-convenience-store.html&linkname=Robots%20replacing%20shelf%20stockers%20in%20Japanese%20convenience%20store%20chain\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-robots-replacing-shelf-stockers-japanese-convenience-store.html&linkname=Robots%20replacing%20shelf%20stockers%20in%20Japanese%20convenience%20store%20chain\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-robots-replacing-shelf-stockers-japanese-convenience-store.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 03:53:04', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '150', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

A <em><a href=\"https://www.usc.edu/\">University of Southern California</a></em> (USC) research team recently identified a link between toxic chemicals and', 'non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a common type of liver cancer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jhep-reports.eu/article/S2589-5559(22)00122-7/fulltext\">According to the study</a> published in <em>Jhep Reports</em>, a particular type of &#8220;forever chemical&#8221; called <a href=\"https://chemicals.news/\">perfluorooctane sulfonic acid</a> (PFOS) may have a particularly strong connection to the <a href=\"https://keck.usc.edu/synthetic-forever-chemical-linked-to-liver-cancer/\">development of this fatal illness</a>.</p>\n<p>PFOS is one of the thousands of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and is found widely throughout the environment. PFAS are a set of toxic chemicals found in household products such as nonstick pans, waterproof apparel, cosmetics and even shampoo. Experts referred to them as &#8220;forever chemicals&#8221; because they can take years to degrade in the body or the environment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Liver cancer is one of the most serious endpoints in liver disease and this is the first study in humans to show that PFAS are associated with this disease,&#8221; Jesse Goodrich, the study&#8217;s lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at USC <em><a href=\"https://keck.usc.edu/\">Keck School of Medicine</a></em>, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Previous studies in animals have suggested that PFAS exposure <a href=\"http://cancercauses.news\">increases the risk of liver cancer</a>, but the latest one is the first to confirm a connection in human samples.</p>\n<p>The USC researchers collected data from the &#8220;Multiethnic Cohort Study&#8221; and from a pool of over 200,000 people – 50 that had developed liver cancer were chosen and matched with 50 others that did not.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;Part of the reason there have been few human studies is that you need the right samples,&#8221; said Dr. VeVeronica Wendy Setiawan, a professor of population and public health sciences at USC.</p>\n<p>So they analyzed blood samples from the cancer patients before their diagnosis and compared them to the control group of those who never developed the disease.</p>\n<p>They found that many of the people who eventually developed cancer had multiple types of chemicals in their bloodstream. Higher levels also increased a person&#8217;s risk of having cancer. The study concluded that people in the top ten percent of exposure to the chemicals were 4.5 times more likely to suffer from cancer.</p>\n<p>The chemicals will usually enter the liver after being ingested in some way and will become embedded in the liver. The USC team found that PFOS alters glucose metabolism, bile acid metabolism and amino acids in the liver.</p>\n<p>As a result of the disruption, more <a href=\"http://liverdamage.news\">fat will form around the liver</a> and put a person at an increased risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or even liver cancer.</p>\n<h2>EPA&#8217;s tests do not accurately reflect levels of PFOS in drinking water</h2>\n<p>Back in June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an advisory to drastically reduce acceptable levels of PFOS in household goods. The new guidance stated that the EPA no longer recommends drinking water with more than 0.004 parts per trillion (ppt) of PFOA and 0.02 ppt of PFOS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;EPA is taking aggressive action as part of a whole-of-government approach to prevent these chemicals from entering the environment and to help protect concerned families from this pervasive challenge,&#8221; EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration has allocated $10 billion to specifically address PFAS and other contaminants in drinking water. But critics say when it comes to identifying PFAS-contaminated water, the limitations of the test used by state and federal regulators virtually guarantee regulators will never have a full picture of contamination levels.</p>\n<p>According to them, the test called EPA 537 can&#8217;t accurately measure how contaminated the water is as the industry churns out new compounds much faster than researchers can develop the science to measure them.</p>\n<p>Back in July, news outlet the <em>Guardian</em> made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/06/us-drinking-water-pfas-toxic-forever-chemicals-epa-tests\">analysis of water samples</a> taken in nine cities with high levels of PFAS pollution and examined the samples using two types of tests: an EPA-developed method that detects 30 types of PFAS and a more robust method that checks for a marker of the more than 9,000 PFAS compounds known to exist.</p>\n<p>In seven of the nine cities, higher levels of PFAS were found in water samples when using a &#8220;total organic fluorine&#8221; (TOF) test that identifies markers for all known PFAS compounds than when using the EPA test – at concentrations up to 24 times greater.</p>\n<p>&#8220;EPA is <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/epa-u-s-drinking-water-contamination-toxic-pfas-forever-chemicals/\">doing the bare minimum</a> it can and that is putting people&#8217;s health at risk,&#8221; said Kyla Bennett, the policy director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

New Zealand is our country; we&#8217;ve always been unified and we&#8217;ve always been fair-minded people,&#8221; Grey stated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://suegreytauranga.co.nz/about-sue\">The Kiwi lawyer</a>, who has been active in law reform on a range of human rights, health, environmental and resource allocation issues, cited the insidious propaganda blaming people for this or that has really caused a lot of harm in the country.</p>\n<p>Grey said a lot of New Zealanders have actually left the country. She mentioned that almost a million New Zealanders from their population of five million have either left or want to leave New Zealand because of the government&#8217;s COVID response.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The Nelson-born lawyer, who is now based in Tauranga, said these New Zealanders will go back home and fight even harder because they cannot let the government get away with it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want our country back for our people. And we want it back just on the same level playing field that we had it before. We don&#8217;t need to keep being afraid,&#8221; Grey said.</p>\n<h2>Police officers assault protesters at Parliament grounds</h2>\n<p>Grey also mentioned that hundreds of New Zealand police officers have assaulted people peacefully protesting at the Parliament grounds. These assaults have caused very serious injuries to some of the protesters. (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-01-19-dutch-protesters-march-on-streets-oppose-lockdowns.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch protesters march on the streets of Amsterdam to protest COVID lockdowns</a>.)</p>\n<p>She added that a lot of groups went back to hold smaller protests around the country while other people have gone home to share the word of what happened and inspired communities all around New Zealand to start asking questions about what the government is doing.</p>\n<p>Tens of thousands of New Zealanders were involved in the protest that happened at the Parliament in Wellington. And according to Grey, the government has not apologized for the way it handled the disbandment of the protest.</p>\n<p>Grey noted that there are around 2,000 complaints filed against the police because of the incident.</p>\n<p>The lawyer also told Ardis that most of the people in her country got the shots to keep their jobs. Grey also questioned the government&#8217;s claims that 95 percent of people in New Zealand have been at least double-vaccinated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where they get those figures, but I&#8217;m sure the government is just putting out made-up statistics,&#8221; she said, adding that the percentages of vaccinated and unvaccinated New Zealanders are much more like 50-50.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://medicalfascism.news\">MedicalFascism.news</a> for more on New Zealand&#8217;s COVID pandemic response.</p>\n<p>Watch the <a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/b92a9a64-1ea7-4927-bf89-44c475b95d63\">August 10 episode of &#8220;The Dr. Ardis Show&#8221; below</a>. &#8220;The Dr. Ardis Show&#8221; airs every Wednesday at 10 a.m. and every Saturday at 11 a.m. on <a href=\"https://brighteon.tv/\"><em>Brighteon.TV</em></a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>More related stories:</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-09-14-covid-zero-turns-nz-into-tyrannical-regime.html\" target=\"_blank\">New Zealand transforms into a tyrannical regime in pursuit of &#8220;COVID Zero.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-01-employees-new-zealand-required-vaccinated-covid.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nearly everyone who holds a job in New Zealand now required to get &#8220;vaccinated&#8221; for covid</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://healthfreedom.news/2022-07-21-covid-overwhelming-new-zealand-singapore-despite-masks.html\">COVID cases overwhelming New Zealand and Singapore despite strict mask mandates</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-12-jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-struggling-against-covid.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jacinda Ardern admits New Zealand is struggling to deal with COVID-19 pandemic despite high vaccination rate</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-03-24-australia-new-zealand-covid-psychological-experimentation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Australia and New Zealand are targets of COVID psychological experimentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/b92a9a64-1ea7-4927-bf89-44c475b95d63\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://suegreytauranga.co.nz/about-sue\">SueGreyTauranga.co.nz</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-new-zealand-covid-response-causes-more-harm.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Atty.

I keep seeing things that don&#8217;t make sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The attorney warned of the deep corruption in Washington, D.C., pointing to the fact that the justice system and law enforcement – the <em>Federal Bureau of Investigation</em> (FBI) in particular – are being used as political tools. He added that the government cannot politicize the FBI, the <em>Department of Justice</em> (DOJ) and the justice system at large as it is &#8220;unconstitutional on a massive level.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Renz, people being arrested or persecuted because of their political positions should not be happening in America. Any police officer, military member or citizen participating in this kind of action is committing a treasonous or seditious act.</p>\n<p>If judges and lawyers who represent the people fail to ensure equality and justice, people are going to lose faith in the system – something Renz called &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221; He warned that Americans run the risk of destroying their society and nation if they do not see a system or mechanism that they can receive fair justice.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Renz appealed to his fellow lawyers and judges to consider their actions and the damage that is being done to America&#8217;s faith in the legal system.</p>\n<p>Citing the example of Gen. Michael Flynn, who was persecuted by the FBI and DOJ, Renz said that <a href=\"http://biased.news\">courts being openly political</a> and going after people solely for political reasons means the justice system is in serious need of reform.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Renz pointed out that Americans are seeing a justice system turned against the people in an unfair way. The country cannot have a two-tiered justice system that favors those who are in the upper class or the elites, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not acceptable. Justice has to be blind. Blind to the color of your skin, political affiliations, socio-economic status, blind to everything. It needs to be based on justice.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago proves why justice system needs an overhaul</h2>\n<p>Renz remarked that the Aug. 8 FBI raid on Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump&#8217;s estate, went too far. He explained that the raid was made possible through a politicized legal system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-mar-a-lago-home-florida-siege-fbi-agents\">According to a <em>Fox News</em> report</a>, Trump denounced the raid on his Palm Beach, Florida property in a statement. The former chief executive said the incident was &#8220;an attack by radical left Democrats&#8221; desperate to &#8220;stop Republicans and conservatives in the upcoming [November 2022] midterm elections.&#8221; (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2020-12-07-trump-adviser-doj-fbi-investigate-election-fraud.html\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;Asleep at the wheel&#8217;: Trump adviser says DOJ, FBI need to investigate alleged election fraud</a>.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing like this has ever happened to a U.S. president before. After working and cooperating with the relevant government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the justice system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Such an assault could only take place in broken, third-world countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those countries, corrupt at a level not seen before.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One source told <em>Fox News</em> that the federal agents broke into the property and looked in every single office and safe.

Hotez’s <a href=\"https://reporter.nih.gov/search/WNMviEkAEk-ohjdU9a9JTg/publications/project-details/9056977\">grant</a> underwrote two of Shi’s collaborators on the project.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11427-017-9189-3.pdf\">2017 paper</a> co-funded by Hotez, Shi and her colleagues generated a recombinant virus from two SARS-related coronaviruses: “rWIV1-SHC014S.”</p>\n<p>It’s not clear whether the paper co-funded by Hotez should have been stopped under a temporary “pause” on gain-of-function work before 2017. However, some independent biosecurity experts have said research on this chimeric virus in some ways <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emilyakopp/status/1519399108594872321\">epitomizes lapses in NIH oversight</a> of risky research in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517719113\">prior study</a> of one of the coronaviruses that comprised the chimera, WIV1, found it to be “poised for human emergence.” Another <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985\">prior paper</a> on the other coronavirus, SHC014, stated that its future study in lab-generated viruses may be “too risky to pursue.”</p>\n<p>“The work here should have been at the very least, heavily scrutinized,” said David Relman, a Stanford microbiologist and biosecurity expert. “This work should have been heavily reviewed for [gain-of-function], and probably should have been subject to the pause prior to December 2017.”</p>\n<p>Shi’s participation in the joint project was funded in part by EcoHealth Alliance, the paper shows. This NIH grant to EcoHealth — <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21055989/understanding-risk-bat-coronavirus-emergence-grant-notice.pdf\">“Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence”</a> — <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/09/06/new-details-emerge-about-coronavirus-research-at-chinese-lab/\">has garnered scrutiny</a> for its research on manipulated novel coronaviruses in Wuhan labs.</p>\n<p>Specifically, an EcoHealth Alliance <a href=\"https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Year-5-EHAv.pdf\">grant report</a> obtained by congressional investigators demonstrated that a WIV1-SHC014 chimera generated thousands of times the viral load and enhanced lethality in mice with human airway cells. This prompted concerns among some <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2021/10/22/nih-grantee-in-wuhan-faces-questions-deadline-for-more-information-on-research/\">biosecurity experts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/nih-admits-funding-risky-virus-research-in-wuhan\">scientists</a> and <a href=\"https://republicans-energycommerce.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/4.25.22-Letter-to-Dr.-Lawrence-Tabak-2.pdf\">members of Congress</a>.</p>\n<p>In response to questions from congressional Republicans, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPoversight/status/1450934193177903105/photo/1\">NIH acknowledged</a> that the research was out of compliance with its own regulations on gain-of-function research.</p>\n<p>“In this limited experiment, laboratory mice infected with SHC014 WIV1 bat coronavirus became sicker than those infected with WIV1 bat coronavirus,” the letter read. “As sometimes occurs in science, this was an unexpected result rather than something the scientists set out to do.”</p>\n<p>An investigation could shed light on whether the risks of such experiments outweigh the benefits, but Hotez has not been forthcoming about this apparent conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>“The construction and threat-characterization of rWIV1-SHC014 was — unequivocally — gain-of-function research,” said Richard Ebright, Rutgers Board of Governors Professor of Chemistry at Rutgers University. “It is a conflict of interest that, to my knowledge, has not previously been disclosed to The Lancet Commission … and that surely will be of interest to The Lancet Commission.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Lancet Commission</strong></p>\n<p>Hotez serves on <a href=\"https://covid19commission.org/\">The Lancet COVID-19 Commission</a>, a panel of experts working to scrutinize the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>\n<p>Commission Chair Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist, has in recent weeks <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202769119\">called for</a> an <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/did-us-technology-help-create-covid-19-in-china-by-neil-l-harrison-and-jeffrey-d-sachs-2022-05\">impartial investigation</a> of the lab leak hypothesis.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Hotez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterHotez/status/1554864673467547651?s=20&amp;t=SJLmIIUf6NErW-4z0r5Qyw\">has suggested</a> that the commission’s final reports should not incorporate Sachs’ concerns.</p>\n<p>“Whenever I discussed the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was a laboratory release, Hotez strongly rejected that possibility, but never explained to me or to the Lancet Commission that he actually had a grant that was based on that very kind of risk. He should certainly have been clear on that,” said Sachs.</p>\n<p>Sachs said <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11427-017-9189-3.pdf\">the 2017 paper</a> generated questions about whether a potential conflict of interest should have been disclosed to the commission.</p>\n<p>“I asked all of the Commissioners repeatedly to be transparent about any possible conflicts of interest,” Sachs added.</p>\n<p>Read more at: <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/biohazards/critic-of-congressional-probe-into-gain-of-function-research-helped-fund-wuhan-gain-of-function-study/\">USRTK.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-critic-congressional-probe-funded-gain-of-function.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Critic of congressional probe into gain-of-function research helped fund Wuhan gain-of-function study\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-critic-congressional-probe-funded-gain-of-function.html&linkname=Critic%20of%20congressional%20probe%20into%20gain-of-function%20research%20helped%20fund%20Wuhan%20gain-of-function%20study\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-critic-congressional-probe-funded-gain-of-function.html&linkname=Critic%20of%20congressional%20probe%20into%20gain-of-function%20research%20helped%20fund%20Wuhan%20gain-of-function%20study\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-critic-congressional-probe-funded-gain-of-function.html&linkname=Critic%20of%20congressional%20probe%20into%20gain-of-function%20research%20helped%20fund%20Wuhan%20gain-of-function%20study\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-critic-congressional-probe-funded-gain-of-function.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 02:19:05', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '146', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Fidelito wrote that his father, Fidel Castro, was “<em>always comparing me unfavorably with Justin</em>” and “<em>dismissing my achievements in comparison to his success in Canada.</em>“</p>\n<p>“<em>But what was I to do? I am Cuban. My brother is Canadian. If he was born and raised in Cuba, he would have lived in our father’s shadow forever just like me</em>.”</p>\n<p>Damning evidence, if true. However due to the fact the mainstream media suppresses everything that threatens the liberal power elite, the reported suicide note remains unverified.

According to Kemper, Justin does not write his own speeches or tweets, but instead performs scripts written for him by his globalist overlords.</p>\n<p>Trudeau is “<em>not speaking from his heart,</em>” said his half-brother, who added “<em>blackmail is a very powerful tool.”</em></p>\n<p>Asked why Justin is determined to betray the Canadian nation, his brother said that he is merely a puppet of the New World Order and takes orders directly from groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum.</p>\n<p>Was Justin selected by the globalist elite to perform as a frontman for the New World Order?</p>\n<p>His backstory would make him an ideal candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch:</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Read more at: <a href=\"https://newspunch.com/bombshell-evidence-proves-justin-trudeau-is-fidel-castros-son/\">NewsPunch.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-bombshell-justin-trudeau-is-fidel-castros-son.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Bombshell evidence PROVES Justin Trudeau is Fidel Castro’s son\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-bombshell-justin-trudeau-is-fidel-castros-son.html&linkname=Bombshell%20evidence%20PROVES%20Justin%20Trudeau%20is%20Fidel%20Castro%E2%80%99s%20son\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-bombshell-justin-trudeau-is-fidel-castros-son.html&linkname=Bombshell%20evidence%20PROVES%20Justin%20Trudeau%20is%20Fidel%20Castro%E2%80%99s%20son\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-bombshell-justin-trudeau-is-fidel-castros-son.html&linkname=Bombshell%20evidence%20PROVES%20Justin%20Trudeau%20is%20Fidel%20Castro%E2%80%99s%20son\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-bombshell-justin-trudeau-is-fidel-castros-son.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-13 02:01:02', '82', '', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '145', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', '');/**ABDB**/

The new &#8220;digital tokens&#8221; can be &#8220;turned off&#8221; if the government doesn&#8217;t like what you are doing. Rickards has four decades of experience on Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Rickards criticized CBDC and labeled it as &#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s Evil Cousin.&#8221; He also exposed the supposed singular event called C-Day, which according to him, will take place on Dec. 13, 2022, and will disrupt the traditional financial systems in the U.S.</p>\n<p>He said when what he calls <a href=\"https://pro.paradigmnewsletters.org/p/awn_cday_0522/LAWNY660/?cake_s1=08_92774787_7dfe89fe-c418-4aa5-8e8a-c77f5430dac1&amp;h=true\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;C-Day&#8221;</a> happens, paper money would be worthless and the U.S. dollar would crash.

Every digital dollar will be a programmable token, like bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. But there&#8217;s a big difference … Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies. Instead, if it plays out the way I see it … Biden Bucks will have the full backing of the U.S. Federal Reserve. They will REPLACE the cash (&#8216;fiat&#8217;) dollar we have now. And will soon be the sole, MANDATORY currency of the United States.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kiyosaki agrees. But in this climate of fear Biden is creating – over the possibility of Donald Trump making a comeback – he has the Fed in his corner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Biden Bucks are rolled out, many experts – myself included, believe they will begin an era of total government control and surveillance,&#8221; Rickards stated. &#8220;This is not hyperbole. This would dramatically expand the power and influence of the federal government … essentially acting as a new type of &#8216;spyware.&#8217; With Biden Bucks, the government will be able to force you to comply with its agenda. Because if you don&#8217;t, they could turn off your money. This won&#8217;t be like freezing a bank account, it will be so much easier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just think what this will mean if Biden gets his way – or whoever is behind this plot.</p>\n<p>You want to keep your internal combustion engine car? Your digital dollars suddenly won&#8217;t pay for gas. You&#8217;ll be forced to buy an electric vehicle.</p>\n<p>Rickards calls it &#8220;the tip of the fascist iceberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;America would become a surveillance state like China or North Korea,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>Is this scare talk?

When officers arrived at the scene,', 'they discovered Sims had an outstanding warrant for failure to appear in a homicide case, FOX 5 of Atlanta reported.</p>\n<p>Sims was previously arrested in March 2019, as he was accused of setting a car on fire with a woman\'s body inside in October 2018. He was charged with felony murder and ordered to appear in court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe, just maybe, if you commit a crime DON\'T CALL THE POLICE! </p>\n<p>Especially over something completely idiotic like french fries.</p>\n<p>If you\'re wondering, YES, THERE IS VIDEO:</p>\n<div class=\"w-full block\"><div class=\"w-full text-center\"><div></div></div></div>\n<p>He\'s been on the lam, escaping the police, then gets caught up in this french fry argument.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Friday\'s incident started when Sims and his fiancée were waiting for their food at the McDonald\'s location when the order seemed to be taking too long, Sims explained to Kennesaw police, FOX 5 reported.</p>\n<p>Sims then approached the cashier to ask about the order, which was already waiting on the counter, he said. He was not given a receipt, so he was unable to know if his order number was called, he told police.</p>\n<p>\"So now our food is sitting there cold,\" he explained to the officer, per the report. \"So when I come up, I try the fries. The fries are lukewarm, but they\'re not hot.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>THE FRIES WERE LUKEWARM!</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>I don\'t want to take the side of an alleged murderer, but I might want McD\'s to remake my fries if they let them sit out like that.</p>\n<p>Obviously, he must have been out of control for both parties to call police, however.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sims then requested a new fries order, rather than a refund, then feuded with management. Management then demanded he leave the restaurant and both parties called the police, FOX 5 reported. The manager later told police Sims cursed them out and threw his order at them.</p>\n<p>\"I don\'t ever want him back here,\" the manager told the officer, per the report. \"I mean, dude\'s obviously on probation (out on bond) — got an ankle bracelet on.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, throwing the fries at employees definitely crosses the line.</p>\n<p>Sounds like Antoine is not the most... level-headed individual.</p>\n<p>And he almost got away, but police decided to run his info. This made Sims get a little jumpy.</p>\n<p>Then he jumped into his car to get away once he knew the jig was up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Officers told Sims he was not allowed to re-enter the restaurant and asked him to sign a criminal trespass notice. They also requested dispatch run Sims\' information through crime databases which made him visibly \"agitated,\" a police report said.</p>\n<p>\"I\'m afraid of y\'all. I just did three years, sir. I\'m afraid of y\'all, sir,\" Sims told police, FOX 5 reported. An officer then approached Sims, who sprinted away, sparking a chase.</p>\n<p>Police later tracked Sims to an apartment complex, where a resident said he attempted to break into their third-floor apartment. There, the officers used a stun gun and apprehended Sims.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He was totally fine telling his french fry story to the cops, but when they decided to look up his history, he decided he needed to get out of there.</p>\n<p>He still had the ankle monitor on, however.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sims was taken to a hospital and then to jail.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<p>He was charged for his outstanding warrant, as well as obstruction or hindering law enforcement and criminal trespass. He also had a possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute tacked on as police found 31 grams of marijuana in his fiancée\'s vehicle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>If you\'re wanted for murder, maybe try to lay low and not call the police over french fries.</h4>\n<hr class=\"w-32 my-8 border-gray-400\">\n<p>\nP.S.

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has pocketed up to $100,000 in rental income during the pandemic despite pushing to cancel rent, according to disclosure forms reviewed by Fox News Digital.</p>\n<p>Tlaib filed her latest annual financial disclosure report Thursday,', 'which reveals she collected between $15,001 and $50,000 in rental income from a Detroit property in 2021. The Michigan Democrat reported the same rental income for 2020 last August, meaning she now made between $30,000 and $100,000 from rent payments during the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Tlaib, however, collected the rent checks despite co-sponsoring a bill alongside other \"Squad\" members that sought to cancel rent during the pandemic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The hypocrisy is so overwhelming.</p>\n<p>It\'s the perfect encapsulation of the radical Left.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<h4>Rent is evil, landlords are evil, I\'ll even sponsor legislation to CANCEL rent.

A New York State Police trooper providing security at the event arrested the attacker. Police identified the suspect as Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old man from Fairview, New Jersey, who bought a pass to the event.</p>\n<p>\"A man jumped up on the stage from I don\'t know where and started what looked like beating him on the chest, repeated fist strokes into his chest and neck,\" said Bradley Fisher, who was in the audience. \"People were screaming and crying out and gasping.\"</p>\n<p>A doctor in the audience helped tend to Rushdie while emergency services arrived, police said. Henry Reese, the event\'s moderator, suffered a minor head injury. Police said they were working with federal investigators to determine a motive. They did not describe the weapon used.</p>\n<p>White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan described the incident as \"appalling.\" \"We\'re thankful to good citizens and first responders for helping him so swiftly,\" he wrote on Twitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is absolutely stunning that a religious-based assassination attempt like this could happen on US soil.</p>\n<p>Iran has recently taken a more neutral approach to Rushdie, claiming they neither support nor discourage anyone from killing the author.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The threats sent Rushdie into hiding and he was placed under police protection. In 2000, Rushdie re-emerged and moved to the U.S. Two years earlier, Iranian leader Muhammad Khatami said that the government would \"neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie,\" although some hardliners have continued to call for the author\'s death.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The religion of peace.</p>\n<p>Such tolerance.</p>\n<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/uk/this-24-year-old-man-allegedly-attacked-salman-rushdie-read-details-here/articleshow/93536770.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst\">Economic Times of India</a>, Rushdie\'s home country, have the most details about the attacker.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The alleged attacker has been recognised by police as Hadi Matar.

Like the later signal intrusion, it featured a person wearing a mask swaying erratically in front of a swiveling corrugated metal panel apparently meant to resemble Max Headroom\'s animated geometric background. ... This interruption went on for almost 30 seconds before engineers at WGN were able to regain control of their broadcast tower.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first \"incident\" was without sound save for a monotonous buzzing, which is extremely creepy as it is. But a later hack actually included sound, and it was insanely chaotic enough to be even more disturbing:</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<blockquote><p>The second incident occurred about two hours later during PBS member station WTTW\'s broadcast of <i>Doctor Who</i>. This signal takeover was more sustained, and the masked figure could be heard making reference to the real Max Headroom\'s advertisements for New Coke, the animated TV series <i>Clutch Cargo</i>, WGN sportscaster Chuck Swirsky, \"World\'s Greatest Newspaper nerds\", and other seemingly unrelated topics. The video concluded with a side view of someone\'s exposed buttocks being spanked by a woman with a flyswatter while a voice yelled \"Oh no, they\'re coming to get me!\" At that point, the pirate transmission ended and normal programming resumed after a total interruption of about 90 seconds.</p></blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Creeeepy.</strong></h4>\n<p>Here, we present a sanitized version of the insane hacking video, one in which the \"exposed buttocks\" have been understandably excluded (as has an apparent sexual device that shows up on the hacker\'s finger at one point):</p>\n<p>It\'s just nuts. And the craziest part? Thirty-five years later, whoever did this has <strong>never revealed himself </strong>and has <strong>never been caught:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one has ever claimed responsibility for the stunt. Speculation about the identities of \"Max\" and his co-conspirators has centered around the theories that the prank was either an inside job by a disgruntled employee (or former employee) of WGN or was carried out by members of Chicago\'s underground hacker community.
