Some 19 other Asia Pacific countries were pulled in for symbolic participation. RIMPAC is the world’s largest international maritime exercise.</p>\n<p>This aggressive maritime action took place from June 29 to Aug. 4. In other words, it was going on as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was visiting Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The shaping of information is all pervasive. Whether it is FOX News, CNN, AP, the New York Times or the Washington Post, the multibillion-dollar media are part of and totally intertwined with U.S. military industries. They collaborate in hiding U.S. war plans and provocations.</p>\n<p>The role of the corporate media in totally distorting the news on China must be challenged.</p>\n<h2><strong>China’s right to self-defense</strong></h2>\n<p>The media coverage of China’s military drills around Taiwan never describe them as self-defense. The media display absolute unity, blocking any mention of China’s right to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>Every statement or action taken by China is relentlessly described as “threatening,” “provocative” or “expansionist.” The same words are used again and again in news articles and politicians’ statements.</p>\n<p>There is only one accepted political line. The media repeat that China is irrational, paranoid, belligerent, menacing and overreacting.</p>\n<p>U.S. actions, even military maneuvers in which thousands of troops employ jet bombers and aircraft carriers, are described as “routine rotations” or normal schedules – that is, if the mainstream media report on them at all.</p>\n<p>The Chinese media are always described as state-controlled propaganda. By comparison, the U.S. corporate media are always defined as free and democratic.</p>\n<p>This is so relentless that it impacts even social forces who oppose U.S. militarism and endless U.S. wars.</p>\n<h2><b>Routine threats by U.S. Navy</b></h2>\n<p>RIMPAC is planned and coordinated by the U.S. Navy’s Third Fleet. According to its commander, their massive training is meant to deter escalation by China’s military.</p>\n<p>Only part of the Third Fleet is engaged in RIMPAC. The fleet’s total size comes to a combat-ready force of more than 68,000 people, 100 ships and 400 aircraft.</p>\n<p>Moving into place as Pelosi visited Taiwan was the even larger U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet, the largest of its forward-deployed fleets. At any given time, it amounts to 50 to 70 ships and submarines, 150 aircraft, and more than 27,000 sailors and Marines.</p>\n<p>The Seventh Fleet is led by the USS Ronald Reagan, accompanied by guided-missile destroyers, nuclear submarines and jet aircraft. This ship has now been joined by aircraft carrier battle groups of the USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt.</p>\n<p>It is comparable to a scenario in which Chinese destroyers were to sail into the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of New Orleans and Houston.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Pacific Fleet consists of approximately 200 ships/submarines, nearly 1,200 aircraft, and more than 130,000 sailors and civilians. The U.S. Navy maintains 11 carrier strike groups in international waters.</p>\n<h2><b>Hiding in plain sight</b></h2>\n<p>Isn’t this aggressive and threatening? Yet this vast and deadly armada is hidden in plain sight. It is barely mentioned, but even when hundreds of ships and aircraft are involved, they are described as simply participating in “routine” or “business as usual” exercises.</p>\n<p>These continuing assaults are not top news, but they are reported in military news media, such as the Navy Times.</p>\n<p>When the guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold conducted its third transit through the South China Sea in a week, the Chinese government was prompted to label the move as a provocation. (See <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/bdfsm7pa\">this</a>)</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>The U.S. Navy’s Seventh Fleet has so far this year sent an average of one guided-missile destroyer per month through the Taiwan Strait as a challenge to China. (See <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/7zhn9t87\">this</a>)</p>\n<p>According to the Navy Times, China’s foreign ministry protested:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The U.S. military’s actions have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security, seriously undermined peace and stability in the South China Sea, and seriously violated international law and norms governing international relations.”</p>\n<p>China’s long-held position is that “the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China and should work together to seek national reunification.”</p>\n<p>The Taiwan Strait is part of the South China Sea, and China has claimed the area as its territorial waters. However, the United States has consistently said that it considers the strait to be international waters.</p>\n<h2><strong>Freedom of Navigation – imperialist piracy</strong></h2>\n<p>“Freedom of Navigation” is similar to the grand term “Free Trade.” It is not about freedom. Freedom of Navigation has meant unrestricted U.S., British, French and Japanese access to the looting of China.</p>\n<p>Few people in the U.S. are aware of the fact that, more than a century ago, the U.S. Navy sent fleets of armored ships to patrol Chinese rivers and coastal waters.</p>\n<p>Special fleets of gunboats of the U.S. Navy and Marines patrolled Chinese rivers up to 1,000 miles inland. They were there to enforce U.S. trade interests and suppress uprisings. Armies of occupation from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and Japan were stationed in Chinese cities.</p>\n<p>“Concessions” were forced on China by brutal gunboat diplomacy and enshrined by onerous unequal treaties that made China pay imperialist countries huge indemnities and grant such “concessions” as control of its cities, major ports and largest waterways.</p>\n<p>Britain, with U.S. and French participation, fought two Opium Wars in China to enforce its “right” to sell opium. The merchants called this “defending free trade” and “protecting freedom of navigation.”</p>\n<p>It was the 1949 victory of the Chinese Communist Party that finally ended these “Freedom of Navigation” invasions into China’s mainland, opening the opportunity to rebuild a strong, united China which is increasingly able to defend its coastal waters and resist U.S. imperialist demands.</p>\n<p>The corrupt and defeated former military forces, defending the rights of the old landlord class, withdrew, with U.S. Navy protection, to the island province of Taiwan. This was hardly a democratic process. It was a totally militarized U.S. occupation of the island.</p>\n<p>China has held a consistent, well-understood position on its sovereignty and territorial integrity that is recognized internationally in all world bodies. China has repeatedly asserted its right to resolve this unfinished national reunification.</p>\n<h2><b>U.S. violates signed agreements</b></h2>\n<p>Washington is openly violating three different signed agreements – Joint Communiques it made with China in 1972, 1979 and 1982 – affirming that China is one country and Taiwan is a province of China.</p>\n<p>Any focus on these signed agreements of “One China” in the Western media today would expose that the U.S. has broken its promises not to interrupt China’s efforts to reunify the island peacefully.</p>\n<p>Once in a while the truth slips in. Roger Waters, co-founder of Pink Floyd, an English rock band formed in London in 1965, is now on a final U.S. tour titled: “This is not a drill.”  In an interview with CNN on August 7, Waters refuted the narrative about Taiwan.</p>\n<p>When CNN host Michael Smerconish said in the interview that “China is too busy encircling Taiwan,” Waters immediately said, “They’re not encircling Taiwan, Taiwan is part of China, and that’s been absolutely accepted by the whole of the international community since 1948.” Smerconish tried to interrupt Waters, saying that China is “on the top of the list of human rights offenders.” Waters immediately shot back: “The Chinese didn’t go to Iraq and kill 1 million people in 2003.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><b>Pelosi and insider trading</b></h2>\n<p>The U.S. corporate media are united in hostility to China. At the same time, different media can favor either a Democratic or Republican presidency.</p>\n<p>For example, Fox News, guilty of a daily barrage of racist stereotypes against China, was at the forefront of exposing Nancy Pelosi’s husband, <strong>Paul Pelosi</strong>, for his multimillion-dollar insider stock trading in a semiconductor firm just before Congress voted to give $52 billion to chip manufacturers in the U.S., called the CHIPS Act.</p>\n<p>Despite this scandal and her role as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi met with the chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer and a beneficiary of the U.S. legislation.</p>\n<p>TSMC plans to build a $12-billion chip factory in the U.S. The semiconductor industry is a priority for the U.S. “containment” of China. At the same time, the U.S. government is using various sanctions to suppress Chinese high-tech companies and break chip supply chains away from China.</p>\n<h2><b>Effort to reverse U.S. corporate decline</b></h2>\n<p>Wang Peng, a research fellow at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, explained:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The U.S. is using the CHIPS Act to force companies in countries and regions of key status on the global chip supply and industrial chains to play by U.S. rules, as well as encircling and suppressing chip industries in emerging markets,”</p>\n<p>The bill’s requirement is for companies to pick only one of two choices: business ties with China, or subsidies from the U.S. government. (See <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1271588.shtml\">this</a>)</p>\n<p>The problem U.S. imperialists face is how to force countries in the region to act against their own economic interests.</p>\n<p>Taiwan’s annual exports to China come to $126.2 billion, almost double its exports to the U.S. of $65.9 billion. South Korea’s exports to China, at $132.5 billion, far outweigh the $74.4 billion to the U.S. Japan’s exports to China come to $163.8 billion, compared to only $135.9 billion in exports to the U.S.</p>\n<p>In order to force high-tech companies to decouple from the People’s Republic of China, U.S. imperialism needs a political/military crisis with China. Every U.S. plan for sanctions on China starts with a manufactured crisis over Taiwan.</p>\n<p>U.S. imperialism’s strategy of restructuring and distorting the global economy to serve its own short-term interests of maximizing immediate profits has led to an aggressive U.S. expansion of NATO and provocations in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The immediate threat to U.S. hegemony was the EU trade with Russia of $260 billion a year — 10 times its trade with the U.S. The EU has also been the largest investor in Russia. Breaking this growing economic integration of the EU with Russia, and at an even greater level with China, serves the long-term strategic interests of U.S. corporate domination that have been in place since World War II.</p>\n<p>In 2021 China’s GDP was roughly 10 times larger than Russia’s. China is the world’s top trading economy and the number-one exporter of manufactured goods. It is in an increasingly strong position to resist U.S. demands.</p>\n<p>The desperate imperialist strategy to reverse the declining global position of the U.S. will be far more disruptive to the global economy.</p>\n<p>This information on U.S. provocations must be dragged into the daylight by all the forces determined to prevent another imperialist war.</p>\n<p>The role of the U.S. corporate media is to make imperialist threats seem palatable and entirely reasonable. This is possible only by blocking all past history of U.S. wars while using racism to smear and demonize China’s legitimate, reasonable and lawful responses and countermeasures,</p>\n<p>Taiwanese rapper and anti-imperialist commentator Zhong Xiangyu explains:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The U.S. government has never been a protector of Taiwan. The U.S. Navy was the first country to attack Taiwan with a warship in 1867. The U.S. Navy supported Japan in invading Taiwan in 1874. The U.S. government sold weapons to Japan during the Sino-Japanese War, leading to China’s defeat and forcing China to cede Taiwan to Japan in 1895.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Today Taiwan separatism is not true independence. It just means serving U.S. interests in a hegemonic, unequal relationship.” <b> </b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Both houses in the US Congress have approved a $280 billion plan – The Chips and Science Act – to boost US chip manufacturing. Currently, 75 per cent of chip manufacturing in the world takes place in East Asia, centred around Taiwan, South Korea and China. The US aims to re-shore the semiconductor industry back to the US. It also hopes to revive the fortunes of its chip manufacturers like Intel, once upon a time the king of chip manufacturing, currently fighting not to become another has-been like IBM.</em></p>\n<p>While the plan offers various carrots to the semiconductor industry in the US, termed by some as &#8220;corporate handouts&#8221;, it also comes with some substantial stick. Any company availing of its $52.7 billion subsidies for locating computer chip manufacturing in the US is prohibited from expanding or upgrading their advanced chipmaking facilities in China. As a result, companies like Samsung and SK Hynix, two major chip manufacturers who have made substantial investments in China, will now have to choose between walking away from these investments or not availing of the US subsidies.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China has also not been sitting on its hands, waiting for the US to ratchet up its sanctions on its high-tech ambitions in this area. Recognising that the semiconductor industry, particularly advanced chipmaking, is a key area of struggle, it has made a major advance in manufacturing. SMIC, the Shanghai-based chip manufacturer, released its 7nm chips, which have been in the market for the last 12 months. Currently, only Taiwan&#8217;s TSMC and South Korea&#8217;s Samsung have succeeded in manufacturing 7nm chips. Dylan Patel, a leading tech analyst, has written, &#8220;China&#8217;s SMIC is shipping a foundry process with commercially available chips in the open market <em>which are more advanced than any American or European company</em>&#8230;The most advanced American or European foundry produced chips are based on GlobalFoundries 12nm.&#8221; SMIC is the world&#8217;s fifth largest chip manufacturer.</p>\n<p>The astonishing progress in computational power of electronic chips comes from our ability to pack more and more components into a silicon chip. This is known as Moore&#8217;s Law and has continued for the last five decades. A measure of the increased density of components in chips is the size of the transistors being created within the silicon chip. Therefore 14nm, 7nm, and 5nm are an indication of the size of the components in the chip and a measure of its computing power.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Lithography is a critical process in chipmaking and is used to create patterns on silicon wafers using ultraviolet (UV) light. The thinner the line that the lithographic machine creates on the silicon wafer, the more the devices that can be packed into a chip. Each of the measures, 14nm, 7nm, 5nm, etc., is a measure of the density of devices on the chip. The more devices we pack into a chip, the more its computing power and its power consumption.</p>\n<p>I have written earlier in these columns about chip manufacturing and the importance of tools, specifically the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) machines from ASML, the requisite for moving beyond the 14nm chips. It is not that older Deep Ultraviolet Lithography (DUV) machines cannot create higher densities. But the productivity of DUV machines to produce 10nm or 7nm chips is lower than with EUV technology. And going to 5nm or 3nm is not possible without EUV lithography.</p>\n<p>ASML of Netherlands is the only maker of EUV machines in the world. As ASML&#8217;s EUV machine light source that creates the chip patterns is made by an American company, technically, it comes under US regulations. Though ASML was quite unhappy to lose a part of its China market, it has accepted that it will not supply EUV machines to China. For now, it can still continue to supply DUV machines to China, but this may also change in the future.</p>\n<p>The US had believed that without EUV lithographic machines, the Chinese manufacturers would not be able to produce chips below 14nm. The SMIC 7nm chip has therefore blown a big hole in this assumption.</p>\n<p>While DUV lithographic tools can create a high degree of packing of devices on a chip, it requires many more runs and a more complex set of operations to achieve such results. This is how lithographic machines for creating 28nm chips could produce 14 nm chips. This is the same process Intel and others have been trying for some time: use DUV technology to create 10nm or 7nm chips. SMIC is the first to successfully use DUV machines for creating 7nm chips.</p>\n<p>It still does not put SMIC in the same bracket as Taiwan&#8217;s TSMC or South Korea&#8217;s Samsung, which already use EUV technology. But it still puts SMIC ahead of the rest of the pack. It also allows China to compete with products in the market using 7nm chips, as hundreds of its leading companies have come under US sanctions, including Huawei and SMIC. The US interpretation of its powers is that if any company uses US technology, under the US Foreign Direct Product Rule, it must obey the US sanctions regime. That is why ASML&#8217;s machines are under the US sanctions regime; as also any product manufactured using such machines. Therefore TSMC or Samsung, who use EUV machines from ASML, also cannot export any of their advanced chips to entities in China under the US sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>There has been criticism that the 7nm chip from SMIC is only a copy of the TSMC chip and therefore does not show any major advance. While it is indeed a simple chip meant for cryptocurrency mining, according to <em>TechInsights</em>, its importance is that it is a stepping stone for &#8220;achieving a &#8220;true 7nm process&#8221;.</p>\n<p>On the flip side is that China cannot go to 5 or 3nm technology without EUV lithographic machines. Currently, it is able to import DUV machines from ASML. Apart from ASML, two Japanese companies, Canon and Nikon, also manufacture DUV machines. So, where is China in manufacturing lithographic machines?</p>\n<p>China has built indigenous capability in manufacturing chip manufacturing machines for some time, with Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment – or SMEE – as its leading manufacturer. SMEE had announced that it would release its first 28nm DUV machine in 2022, which can be used for 14nm chip manufacture. As SMIC has shown, it can then be used for also manufacturing 7nm chips. There is still no announcement from SMEE&#8217;s DUV machine of a supply date, which would be crucial for China&#8217;s ability to set up large-scale chip manufacturing indigenously.</p>\n<p>The world&#8217;s semiconductor industry is clearly at a crossroads with the risk of the global supply chain splitting into two competing blocks, one led by the US and the other by China. The US semiconductor industry had argued that if such a split happens, then the US, which has a commanding lead in a number of technology areas today, will lose this lead in 5-10 years as a huge part of its profits and, therefore, R&amp;D investments, are financed from their Chinese sales. Losing that market will mean that China will face a temporary setback but the US will permanently lose its leadership. This is why ASML&#8217;s CEO Peter Wennink has said the export restrictions regime that the US is forcing on the industry would not work.</p>\n<p>The bulk of the chip market is not for the more advanced chips. According to a report published by the Boston Consulting Group/Semiconductor Industry Association (BCG/SIA) in late 2020, chips less than 10nm density are only 2 per cent of the market, even though they are the most glamorous and figure in the latest laptops and mobile phones. The bulk of the market is in chips for which China already has the technology or can play catch up with its investments in research and in building the entire supply chain, including chip fabrication and even DUV machines. According to the BCG/ SIA report, the smart way for the west to &#8220;combat&#8221; China would be to restrict the sanctions to only military tech and, from the profits from the rest, finance the R&amp;D expenditure of the US companies. Without these profits, US companies will not be able to finance their future development.</p>\n<p>But with &#8220;politics in command&#8221; in the US and a bi-partisan war hysteria being whipped up, the US seems to prefer the carrot and stick approach: carrot for investing in chip manufacture in the US; and the stick for any company setting up production in China. If the Covid-19 pandemic damaged the semiconductor supply chain leading to a chip shortage in 2021, the supply chain shock in the future is going to be from the US sanctions regime. The belief that the US can restrict the trade war only to sectors where they have a technical edge is the other weakness of the US strategy. It leaves open the possibility of asymmetric responses from China. &#8220;May you live in interesting times&#8221; is supposedly a traditional Chinese curse. The world appears to be entering such a phase, starting with the US-China chip war.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Second in line to the U.S. presidency, Pelosi’s August 2 visit to Taiwan is the highest-level trip there since her predecessor, the rabidly reactionary ex-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich’s foray a quarter of a century ago to this island still claimed by Beijing, located about 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/03/covertaction-bulletin-pelosis-visit-to-taiwan-could-be-start-of-world-war-iii/\">As <em>CovertAction Bulletin</em> reported</a>,</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“1979 was the last time that a U.S. head of state or member of the ruling party visited Taiwan. Since the 1970s the official policy of the U.S. has been the One China policy, and this visit undermines this very policy.”</p>\n<p>In Taipei, Pelosi met with Taiwanese<strong> President Tsai Ing-wen</strong> and addressed the parliament as part of her Asia jaunt at taxpayer expense, which has greatly upset the People’s Republic of China—as if our beleaguered planet did not already have enough problems to deal with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pelosi-expected-arrive-taiwan-tuesday-sources-say-2022-08-02/\">A <em>Reuters</em> report</a> uses words such as “enraged” (in the headline) and “furious” to describe Beijing’s reaction to Pelosi’s interloper excursion and quoted China’s foreign ministry as saying the trip “has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and seriously infringes upon China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan-china-military/\"><em>The Washington Post</em> reported</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs added of Pelosi’s trip that ‘China firmly opposes and sternly condemns this, and has made serious démarche [a complaint through diplomatic channels] and strong protest to the United States.’”</p>\n<p>The<em> Post </em>added:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting in Shanghai that U.S. politicians who are ‘playing with fire’ on the issue of Taiwan will ‘come to no good end,’ according to a transcript released by the Foreign Ministry.” Wang has <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2022/08/02/us-house-speaker-pelosi-arrives-in-taiwan-defying-beijing/\">also called the U.S.</a> “the world’s biggest saboteur of peace.”</p>\n<p>Echoing this sentiment, Foreign Ministry <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-official-nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-tensions-with-china-us-relation-asia-tour-1982949-2022-08-02\">spokesperson<strong> Hua Chunying</strong> tweeted</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Making themselves an enemy of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will not end up well. Acting like a bully in front of the whole world will only make everyone see that the U.S. is the biggest danger to world peace.”</p>\n<p>During a two-hour-plus phone call on July 28 between Chinese <strong>President Xi Jinping</strong> and U.S. <strong>President Joe Biden</strong>, Xi <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/202207/t20220729_10729593.html\">warned in no uncertain terms</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The position of the Chinese government and people on the Taiwan question is consistent, and resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. The public opinion cannot be defied. Those who play with fire will perish by it. It is hoped that the U.S. will be clear-eyed about this. The U.S. should honor the one-China principle…”</p>\n<p>According to its Defense Ministry, the PRC has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china-launch-targeted-military-operations-due-pelosi-visit-2022-08-02/\">ramped up</a> “targeted military operations” that “include joint air and sea drills in the north, southwest and southeast of Taiwan, long-range live firing in the Taiwan Strait, and missile test-launches in the sea east of Taiwan, the [People’s Liberation Army’s] Eastern Theatre Command said.”</p>\n<p>Media commentators have used the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3187619/china-set-begin-effective-taiwan-blockade-hours-after-nancy\">“B” word</a> to describe Beijing’s strategic response, with the Hong Kong-based <em>South China Morning Post </em>stating: “China is set to launch an unprecedented military drill that effectively blockades Taiwan until Sunday afternoon following <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3187512/pelosi-arrives-taiwan-legislature-tensions-soar-beijing?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\">U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island</a>.” Some economic sanctions, too, are being imposed on Taipei.</p>\n<h2><strong>East Meets West Meets Geopolitical Gamesmanship</strong></h2>\n<p>After a circuitous route, Pelosi arrived in Taipei aboard a U.S. Air Force passenger jet where she was met by Taiwan <strong>Foreign Minister Joseph Wu</strong>. According to the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11073085/Nancy-Pelosi-lands-Taiwan-amid-warning-pay-price-visit.html\">U.K.’s <em>Daily Mail</em></a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Eight U.S. F-15 fighter jets and five tanker aircraft took off from a U.S. base in Okinawa to provide protection for Pelosi’s flight, NHK reported.”</p>\n<p>The<em> Military Times</em> noted:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“U.S. officials have said the American military will increase its movements in the Indo-Pacific region during Pelosi’s visit. The aircraft carrier USS <em>Ronald Reagan</em> and its strike group were in the Philippine Sea on Monday, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.”</p>\n<p>President Tsai Ing-wen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit/?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_news_alert_revere&amp;location=alert\">gave Pelosi “an award</a>… on behalf of the Congress, the ‘Order of Propitious Clouds with Special Grand Cordon,’” Taipei’s highest civilian honor.</p>\n<p>Pelosi’s reckless, completely unnecessary pot-stirring brinkmanship has been met with disapproval and sparked controversy at home. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Virtually all the senior members of President Biden’s national security team have privately expressed deep reservations about the trip and its timing, said a White House official.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The arrogance of power is especially ominous and despicable when a government leader risks huge numbers of lives in order to make a provocative move on the world’s geopolitical chessboard. Nancy Pelosi’s plan to visit Taiwan is in that category. Thanks to her, the chances of a military confrontation between China and the United States have spiked upward,” <a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosi-could-get-us-all-killed/\">observed longtime peace activist and author <strong>Norman Solomon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Even late-night comic Trevor Noah chimed in on <em>The Daily Show</em>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Nancy Pelosi is going to get us all killed… Now’s not a good time to start World War III.” (Uh Trev, is there ever a <em>good</em> time?)</p>\n<h2><strong>Civil and Uncivil Wars</strong></h2>\n<p>Why is Pelosi blithely playing with fire and acting like the proverbial “bull in a China shop”?</p>\n<p>Let’s circle back to this commentary’s original question: How many Chinese fought in the U.S. Civil War? This may sound facetious, but <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/surprise-asians-fought-in-the-us-civil-war-120282254/163158.html\">some 58 Chinese, almost all immigrants</a> and none of them known to be officials of the Middle Kingdom, actually did see military action during the War Between the States, mostly in the Union Army and Navy.</p>\n<p>Oddly, two sons of the Siamese twins Chang and Eng—who rose to fame and fortune through the Barnum and Bailey Circus and owned slaves on a farm in North Carolina—fought for Dixie, as did three other Chinese men.</p>\n<p><em>Chinese Yankee</em> by Ruthanne Lum McCunn tells the true story of Hong Kong-born Thomas Sylvanus (Ah Yee Way), an orphan brought to America for schooling in the mid-1850s, but enslaved in Baltimore. Only sixteen at the outbreak of war, Thomas ran north, joined the Freedom Army, and was blinded in the first major campaign. He failed to fully recover his sight and, deemed incapable of performing the duties of a soldier, was discharged. Yet he re-enlisted twice, saved his regiment’s colors during the bloodbath of Spotsylvania, was lamed at Cold Harbor, and survived nine months’ imprisonment in the dreaded Andersonville stockade.</p>\n<p>Having said this in the interest of historical accuracy, the fact is that out of the millions of Americans who fought for the North and South during the Civil War, only a miniscule handful were of Chinese ancestry, and none is known to have officially represented the Chinese government. Nor did Empress Dowager Cixi or other powerful Forbidden City leaders <a href=\"https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/china-history/ci-xi.htm\">travel during 1861-1865 to Washington</a> or Richmond, the Confederacy’s capital, to intervene in the U.S. Civil War.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Furthermore, in the summer of <a href=\"http://civildiscourse-historyblog.com/blog/2015/8/3/wrap-the-world-in-fire-the-possibility-of-british-intervention-in-the-american-civil-war\">1861, Secretary of State William Seward sternly cautioned against</a> foreign intervention in America’s domestic affairs while the Union fought the secessionists, boldly warning: “If any European Power provokes a war, we shall not shrink from it. A contest between Great Britain and the United States would wrap the world in fire.” (Note that Seward doesn’t even so much as mention China in his warning.)</p>\n<h2><strong>Pelosi’s Background of Power and Privilege</strong></h2>\n<p>On the other hand, imperialists like Nancy Pelosi have absolutely no idea that they are perpetually meddling in other people’s affairs and should mind their own business. They are not cognizant of it; the notion does not even cross their cerebral cortex. Like the Europeans who crisscrossed the world, claiming and conquering lands whether their inhabitants wanted to be dominated or not, it simply never occurs to interlopers like Pelosi that they have absolutely no right to stick their noses where they do not belong.</p>\n<p>Multi-millionaires and powerful pols like Pelosi are so convinced of their superiority, inevitability and indispensability that they have absolutely no understanding they are overstepping their boundaries because, in their limitless self-esteem and self-conception, the world is their oyster.</p>\n<p>The snooty Pelosi is so self-assured of her own sense of entitlement that she is often dismissive of the free press, treating reporters rudely if they dare question her royal highness. What is the source of Madam Speaker’s high self-regard?</p>\n<p>Pelosi, who has served in Congress longer than any other California Democrat, is a creature of power and privilege who was born into the D’Alesandro dynasty. The 82-year-old’s father Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., served as a Democratic congressman (1939-1947) and mayor of Baltimore (1947-1959)—a position her brother also held.</p>\n<p>Young <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-2013-3#pelosi-grew-up-in-baltimore-the-daughter-of-the-democratic-mayor-thomas-dalesandro-jr-as-a-young-girl-she-managed-her-fathers-book-of-people-who-owed-him-political-favors-1\">Nancy managed the book of people who owed her father political favors</a> and attended JFK’s inauguration.</p>\n<p>After relocating by 1969 to the West Coast, Pelosi, who holds a degree from Trinity College in Washington, D.C., became a Democratic Party fundraiser and then state party chairwoman. In 1987, at the age of 47 after her two kids had gone off to college, Pelosi first ran for Congress in California’s 5<sup>th</sup> Congressional District (long represented by liberal firebrand Phillip Burton) where her posh home was not even located, so her husband, moneybags Paul Pelosi, bought a new home in upper-class Pacific Heights so she would qualify to represent the district in which she was running.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>New York Post</em>, Paul ran a “venture capital and investment firm Financial Leasing Services Inc. Over the years he’s made countless bets on high-profile companies his wife is supposed to regulate, like Amazon, Apple and Google.”<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/how-nancy-pelosi-got-to-congress/\">According to <em>Time </em>political correspondent and Pelosi biographer Molly Ball</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Pelosi’s most formidable rival [in 1987’s special election] would be Harry Britt, a gay socialist former aide to Harvey Milk who had succeeded Milk on the Board of Supervisors. The AIDS crisis was at its height, ravaging the community. Britt had a chance to be the first openly gay man elected to Congress in history, at a time when President Reagan refused even to acknowledge the disease. It was time, Britt contended, for gay men and women to be represented by one of their own, not merely a sympathetic outsider.”</p>\n<p>Thus, during the AIDS epidemic, Pelosi went to Washington by running to the right of and defeating an LGBTQ founder and vice chair of Democratic Socialists of America 36% to 32% in a three-way race.</p>\n<p>To be fair, Pelosi has done some good in her time in Congress—she <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi#:~:text=She%20is%20the%20first%20woman,to%20partially%20privatize%20Social%20Security.\">opposed the Iraq war and the Bush administration’s efforts to privatize Social Security</a>, for example, was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-2013-3#pelosi-was-also-one-of-the-house-architects-behind-the-1994-assault-weapons-ban-along-with-feinstein-and-then-rep-chuck-schumer-11\">one of the House architects behind the 1994 assault weapons ban</a>, helped pass the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank bill regulating Wall Street and Don’t Ask Don’t Tell Repeal Act allowing gays to serve openly in the military and ripped up a copy of President Trump’s “State of the Union” speech on live TV.</p>\n<p>However, Pelosi has also served as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi#:~:text=She%20is%20the%20first%20woman,to%20partially%20privatize%20Social%20Security.\">the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee</a>, rubber-stamping criminal CIA covert interventions. Although she is viewed as a doyenne of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing, this prototypical “corporate liberal” attained power by, according to a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Madam_Speaker/JtD4AgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Nancy+Pelosi+defeated+Harry+Britt&amp;pg=PA106&amp;printsec=frontcover\">Britt campaign brochure</a>, taking donations from “oil companies, highrise developers, Washington lobbyists and other special interests” in order to defeat a candidate far to her Left.</p>\n<h2><strong>Profiteer Pelosi, the Free Marketeer</strong></h2>\n<p>Although she has flip-flopped on the issue, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pelosi-opposes-ban-lawmakers-trading-stocks-her-family-makes-millions-market-1659812\"><em>Newsweek </em>reports</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Pelosi said she was against prohibiting lawmakers from owning and trading individual stocks. ‘We are a free market economy,’ she said. ‘They should be able to participate in that.’”</p>\n<p><em>Newsweek </em>notes:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Pelosi has so far disclosed 48 transactions made by her family worth more than $50 million… Pelosi is currently one of the 25 wealthiest members of Congress, according to <em>Business Insider</em>.”</p>\n<p>Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> a DSA member, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1468398015161552899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1468398015161552899%7Ctwgr%5E3b7fc892cb0d614a66a06dc294ae3bd9d59d1ef5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fnancy-pelosi-opposes-stocks-ban-these-officials-have-made-most-trading-1659946\">tweeted</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“It is absolutely ludicrous that members of Congress can hold and trade individual stock while in office.

Yet Pelosi defends the practice.”</p>\n<h2><strong>A Chip Off the Old Blockhead</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/the-real-reason-nancy-pelosi-wants-to-keep-trading-individual-stocks/\">The<em> Post </em>also observes:</a></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“From 2007 to 2020, the speaker and her spouse raked in between $5.6 million and $30.4 million (the rules don’t even require exact disclosure) from just five Big Tech firms: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.”</p>\n<p>Microsoft has been <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/nancy-pelosi/contributors?cid=N00007360&amp;cycle=CAREER\">one of Pelosi’s top campaign contributors</a>, donating $113,822 to her since 1989.</p>\n<p>Congress may have dropped the ball on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and Biden’s Build Back Better Act but, in July 2022, Congress somehow managed to pass the $52 billion <a href=\"https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/72022\">Pelosi-backed CHIPS Act of 2022</a>to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing.</p>\n<p>According to the Australian Broadcasting Corp., during her Taipei foray, Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-03/us-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-visits-taiwanese-parliament/101295692\">“said a U.S. bill on computer chips was a good opportunity for more cooperation with Taiwan.”</a></p>\n<p>The world’s number 1 and 3 largest manufacturing companies that produce the microchips that power Big Tech, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and United Microelectronics Corporation, are <a href=\"https://history-computer.com/the-10-largest-chip-manufacturers-in-the-world-and-what-they-do/\">based in Taiwan</a>. Mere coincidence or self-dealing? Could this have something to do with Pelosi’s insistence on going to Taiwan, even if it means upsetting the international apple cart? Hmmm, inquiring minds want to know…</p>\n<h2><strong>Perpetual Busybodies, Endlessly Intervening in Others’ Internal Affairs</strong></h2>\n<p>It never dawns on one percenters like Pelosi, who have such high opinions of themselves, that they simply do not belong in a quarrel on the other side of the world. The distance between Taipei and San Francisco is 6,449 miles; between Taipei and Washington, D.C., 7,864 miles.</p>\n<p>The closest U.S. territory to Taiwan is the American colony of Guam—one-third owned and operated by the Pentagon—located 1,711 miles away, while Hawaii—where the U.S. military owns and operates 21% of Oahu, including Pearl Harbor—is 5,142 miles from Taipei.</p>\n<p>Imperialist busybodies like Pelosi need to mind their own business, and let the people of China, as well as the Formosans (the Indigenous people of Taiwan who are almost always left out of the discussion) settle their own differences and disputes among themselves.</p>\n<p>As we can clearly see by this latest outsider incursion, this foreign intrusion into what are essentially domestic matters and squabbles only exacerbate and heighten their problems. (Hey, how did those Iraq and Afghanistan invasions end up working out?)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, these eternal trespassers want to do so without being held accountable for their encroachments. Thus, like Orwellian Newspeak, we are now witnessing the birth of new definitions. Consider this <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20220802-white-house-warns-china-against-escalation-over-pelosi-s-potential-taiwan-visit\"><em>France 24</em> headline</a>: “White House warns China against escalation over Pelosi’s… Taiwan visit”</p>\n<p>Now, words like “escalation” and “retaliation” mean how a country that has been provoked by a superpower provocateur dares to respond to the offending party’s provocative actions. In this imperialist doublethink, countermeasures to blatant provocations are characterized as “escalation.” MSNBC hack Andrea Mitchell chimed in, insisting that no matter what Pelosi did, “They [PRC] started it!” The imperialists sure can dish it out, but they cannot take it. The elite must never ever be held accountable for their actions.</p>\n<p>Although the U.S. media correctly point out that the People’s Republic of China considers Taiwan to be a “breakaway, renegade” province of China proper that is now “self-ruled,” I have not seen/heard/watched a single report that discussed the Chinese Revolution that spawned this conundrum and split.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the Chinese Civil War was fought between the USSR-backed Chinese Communist Party and the U.S.-backed Kuomintang (KMT) from about 1927 to 1949, pitting China’s peasants and workers against its elite. In 1949, the CCP led by Chairman Mao Zedong triumphed and, with its tails between its legs, the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, a man of legendary corruption, fled across the Taiwan Strait and established a military dictatorship on that island, where martial law lasted almost four decades.</p>\n<p>Now Pelosi, an old Cold Warrior whose world view was formed during the 1950s, is using a retread of the tired old anticommunist sloganeering, which in the past pit <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-visit-china-us-tensions/card/pelosi-says-visit-to-taiwan-is-in-support-of-democracy-not-a-change-in-u-s-policy-UtNiB115PcOXjPcvybo1\">“the free world” against “communism” and “Red China.”</a></p>\n<p>Although the CCP still politically rules the PRC, given China’s tremendous market reforms and development, Pelosi currently rephrases the tired old Cold War mantra as: “America’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.”</p>\n<p>Which part of our much-vaunted system do the Pelosis of the world want to export to China, et al.? The electoral college? The fact that Americans have no direct vote for president? The unelected Supreme Court with life tenure that is stripping away our rights and freedoms?</p>\n<p>The Senate filibuster and other measures such as two senators per state, no matter what the size of their population, enables minority rule? The right to purchase weapons of war to perpetrate mass slaughter in our schools, malls, places of worship, July 4<sup>th</sup> parades, the Las Vegas strip, etc.? Student debt? Earth’s highest incarceration rate in the land of the “free”?</p>\n<p>To return to the U.S. Civil War metaphor, in reality, Madam Speaker is following in the footsteps of Madame Chiang, and backing the side that would be equivalent to the Confederacy.</p>\n<p>U.S. ruling circles may be alarmed at how “aggressive” modern China has supposedly become, but if one were to compare Beijing’s military posture to that of Washington’s incessantly interventionist foreign policy and militarism, with 750-plus bases girdling the globe and endless invasions, colossal Pentagon budgets, drone warfare, covert ops, cruel sanctions and so on, it would be laughable. In the 21<sup>st</sup> century alone, America has slaughtered at least hundreds of thousands of human beings with completely unnecessary wars inflicted in Iraq and dubious other military adventures throughout the Middle East, Afghanistan and beyond. China’s military stance and defense budget is truly dwarfed by that of the bloody American empire, willy-nilly endlessly interfering around the world, as arguably the most destabilizing force in the world today, pursuing the same outdated Cold War strategy and realpolitik it has essentially practiced since 1949, still pitting Washington against Beijing and Moscow.</p>\n<h2><strong>Running Dogs</strong></h2>\n<p>Like all bullies Washington hates to pick on somebody its own size. The nuclear-armed United States prefers to invade smaller, helpless countries—Reagan’s counterinsurgency in Central America and the invasion of tiny Grenada are the more cowardly America’s speed.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to other big powers like Russia and China, perpetually throwing your weight around does not always work. Taunting and bullying will only get you so far. After the Bush regime promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not “move one inch east of Germany,” starting in the 1990s, Boris Yeltsin and then Vladimir Putin began warning the West against NATO expansion that eventually pushed right up to Russia’s borders.</p>\n<p>When somebody is nuclear-armed and dangerous like Putin, it is incumbent upon wise statesmanship to listen to what your adversary is telling you and warning you against. This is not in any way to justify (but perhaps to explain) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but a clear failure of statecraft and diplomacy led to this horrific turn of events.</p>\n<p>Now, not content with triggering a war involving Moscow, entitled globetrotters like Nancy Pelosi traipse around the planet on the taxpayers’ dime and pick a fight with another mighty nuclear power with substantial armed forces. Unlike Grenada, China can fight back and will not be pushed around.</p>\n<p>What is really behind Washington’s anxiety is that China seems to be on the rise, while America is in decline. To be sure, the PRC—like the U.S.—is an imperfect entity with lots of room for improvement. Critics could point to Hong Kong, the Uyghurs, mass surveillance, the zero-tolerance Covid policy, policies toward Taiwan and much more. But this is really <em>absolutely none of America’s business</em>. Should Beijing, Moscow, et al., base their foreign relations with Washington on the mistreatment of George Floyd, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor and the countless other African Americans slaughtered and abused by U.S. law enforcement?</p>\n<p>And just as Western policy makers triggered the Russian bear, when it comes to the Pelosis of the world, rash decision makers who misbehave like pitbulls in China shops may learn the hard way that when it comes to China, if you travel from afar to smash a beehive with a baseball bat, you just might get stung. In the immortal words that may have originated with East German youth at a 1950 Berlin march: “Yankee, Go Home!” And while you’re at it, fix your own troubled household, instead of searching for endless enemies and troublemaking abroad.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

great to spend my last day on air with pals Wolf [Blitzer], Anderson [Cooper]', 'and Don [Lemon].

A three week investigation ended when Conde Nast, the parent company for the New Yorker, fired Toobin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CNN however, didn’t fire the scandalized host, who returned to the network in July of 2021 after a months-long leave of absence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Upon his return to CNN, Toobin addressed the controversy and called it “deeply moronic.”</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62899 \" id=\"quads-ad62899\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n<div id=\"ld-4094-4953\"></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“I didn’t think other people could see me,” the legal analyst told anchor Alisyn Camerota. “I have tried, and I am trying now, to say how sorry I am, sincerely, in all seriousness.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Above all, I am sorry to my wife and to my family but I am also sorry to the people on the Zoom call, I’m sorry to my former colleagues at the New Yorker, I’m sorry to my current, fortunately, still colleagues at CNN and I’m sorry to the people who read my work and who watched me on CNN and thought I was a better person than this.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CNN faced pushback for its decision to keep Toobin in its employ after his touchy display. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The liberal commentator and analyst was also attacked over a column shortly after his reinstatement that </span><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/08/18/jeffrey-toobin-ripped-over-column-arguing-against-prosecuting-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">argued against Attorney General Merrick Garland</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> prosecuting former President Donald Trump.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The abrupt decision by Toobin to leave may have to do with former CNN boss Jeff Zucker, who many credit with keeping Toobin on the station after his display.

Ducey signed an executive order on Friday afternoon, authorizing</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to begin construction.</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62900 \" id=\"quads-ad62900\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n \n<div id=\"M720235ScriptRootC1149360\"> \n</div> \n \n \n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The order was unexpectedly announced after construction had already begun, and the governor’s office said the work would be concluded', 'over the weekend. The order comes just days after the Biden administration lifted the Trump Era “</span><a href=\"https://www.dailywire.com/news/dhs-ready-to-end-trump-era-remain-in-mexico-border-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Remain in Mexico</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">” policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Arizona has had enough,” Ducey said in a </span><a href=\"https://azgovernor.gov/governor/news/2022/08/governor-ducey-issues-executive-order-fill-gaps-border-wall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. “We can’t wait any longer. The Biden administration’s lack of urgency on border security is a dereliction of duty. For the last two years, Arizona has made every attempt to work with Washington to address the crisis on our border. Time and time again we’ve stepped in to clean up their mess. Arizonans can’t wait any longer for the federal government to deliver on their delayed promises.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Our border communities are being used as the entryway to the United States, overwhelming law enforcement, hospitals, nonprofits and residents,” Ducey added. “It’s our responsibility to protect our citizens and law enforcement from this unprecedented crisis. With the resources and manpower in the right places, our Border Patrol and law enforcement will be better equipped to do their jobs well and prevent cartels from exploiting our communities. That’s exactly what our barrier mission will do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The barrier will be constructed using 60 8,800 pound, 9&#215;40 foot shipping containers. They will be linked together, then welded shut and topped with razor wire. The barrier will be approximatelhy 22 feet high, and is expected to cost only $6 million, which will be taken from the $335 million “Arizona Border Security Fund.”</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62899 \" id=\"quads-ad62899\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n<div id=\"ld-4094-4953\"></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The state first made the announcement in a press call Friday morning, just six minutes after construction had started, according to the </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/arizona-reveals-new-border-wall-with-mexico-were-done-waiting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Washington Examiner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The state had not yet informed the Department of Homeland Security or the White House of the decision at the time, and had only made the decision earlier this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“At this point, we are filling that gap and we’ll figure out the consequences,” Ducey’s general counsel, Anni Foster, told reporters. “But bottom line is, is that the federal government has a duty to protect the states. They failed to do that. We have made every effort to work with them and try to resolve this problem, but the governor can no longer wait for the federal government to take action when we have a community like Yuma, who is being sheltered at 150% of capacity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C.J. Karamargin, Ducey’s communications director, said that the state had been waiting for action to be taken by the Biden administration, after they had announced in December that they would be taking action to fill gaps in the wall. The Biden administration made a similar announcement in </span><a href=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/biden-reverses-course-on-gaps-in-areas-of-border-wall-as-crisis-hits-d-c-elections-loom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">July</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“December came and went. January, February, March. Here we are in mid-August,” Karamargin said. “We’ve been waiting a very long time for the federal government to act on measures they said they were going to do and we haven’t seen any tangible evidence that they’re following through. So we will be doing it ourselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Our hope is that they’ll be paying attention to the news today,” he added.</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad64185 \" id=\"quads-ad64185\" style=\"float:left;margin:0px 0px 0px 0;padding:10px 10px 10px 0;\">\n<p removeable><strong><i>Scroll down to leave a comment and share your thoughts.</i></strong></p>\n<div removeable id=\"ld-9325-4135\"></div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 0px\"></div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://resistthemainstream.org/arizona-announces-its-building-its-own-border-wall-the-governor-is-done-waiting-for-the-biden-administration-to-act/\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 23:19:23', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '246', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

correspondent Ali Vitali, Hillary Clinton once accused her former Democratic Party rival Bernie Sanders of being sexist, alleging that he routinely made demeaning comments about women, including those he campaigned against.</span></p>\n<div class=\"jeg_ad jeg_ad_article jnews_content_inline_ads  \"><div class=\"ads-wrapper align-center \"><div class=\"ads_code\">\n<div

class=\"rtm_ad_toggle_off\">OFF</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The exclusive quote from Clinton came from Vitali’s new book, &#8220;Electable: Why America Hasn’t Put a Woman In the White House … Yet,&#8221; a political memoir about her time covering the female candidates of recent U.S. presidential elections.</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62900 \" id=\"quads-ad62900\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n \n<div id=\"M720235ScriptRootC1149360\"> \n</div> \n \n \n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Politico published an excerpt of the book on it’s website focusing on the democratic primary for the 2020 election,', 'from the perspective of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and the argument she had with her rival progressive candidate over comments he allegedly made that “a woman couldn’t win” the election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As Vitali’s book recalled, during the now infamous 2020 Democratic primary debate night, moderator Abby Phillip of CNN addressed Sanders: &#8220;CNN reported yesterday, and Senator Sanders, Senator Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018, you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election.&#8221; She then asked, &#8220;Why did you say that?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitali recounted Sanders’ quote, in which Sanders reportedly claimed, &#8220;Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t say it. And I don’t want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody who knows me knows that it’s incomprehensible that I would think that a woman couldn’t be president of the United States.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One particular moment that would eventually go viral came at the </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-appears-to-snub-sanders-handshake-after-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">end of the debate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, where Warren, with a hot mic, confronted Sanders, saying, &#8220;I think you called me a liar on national TV.&#8221; Sanders waved off the concerns, saying &#8220;Let’s not do this now,&#8221; and stepped off the stage after an awkward moment.</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"quads-location quads-ad62899 \" id=\"quads-ad62899\" style=\"float:none;margin:0px 3px 3px 3px;padding:0px;\">\n<div class=\"quads-ad-label quads-ad-label-new\">Advertisements</div>\n<div id=\"ld-4094-4953\"></div>\n</div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, Vitali alleges that Warren wasn’t the only female candidate to be disgruntled at Sanders, after her 2016 loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The journalist claimed in the excerpt that Clinton sounded off on the Vermont senator&#8217;s sexism surrounding the incident. Vitali wrote, &#8220;Hillary Clinton was watching this debate moment, too. ‘I believed her, because I know Sanders, and I know the kind of things that he says about women and to women,’ she told me, her distaste for her 2016 opponent still palpable.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&#8220;I asked what she thought about the hot mic moment. ‘I wish she had done it on mic,’ Clinton said. ‘I wish that she had pushed back in front of everybody.

Much like anything else, politics and money have been used to warp people’s minds and encourage them to embrace what is bad for them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt all began with John D. Rockefeller who was an oil magnate, a robber baron, America’s first billionaire, and a natural-born monopolist.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBy the turn on the 20th century, he controlled 90% of all oil refineries in the U.S. through his oil company, Standard Oil, which was later on broken up. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAround that same time, scientists discovered “petrochemicals” and the ability to create all kinds of chemicals from oil. Scientists were discovering that many pharmaceutical drugs could be made from oil.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRockefeller immediately seized on the opportunity to monopolize the oil, chemical and medical industries all at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe best thing about petrochemicals was that everything could be patented and sold for high profits.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut there was one problem with Rockefeller’s tyrannical plan for the medical industry: natural &amp; herbal medicines were very popular in America at that time.

Much like anything else, politics and money have been used to warp people’s minds and encourage them to embrace what is bad for them.\n\nIt all began with John D. Rockefeller who was an oil magnate, a robber baron, America’s first billionaire, and a natural-born monopolist.\n\nBy the turn on the 20th century, he controlled 90% of all oil refineries in the U.S. through his oil company, Standard Oil, which was later on broken up. \n\nAround that same time, scientists discovered “petrochemicals” and the ability to create all kinds of chemicals from oil. Scientists were discovering that many pharmaceutical drugs could be made from oil.\n\nRockefeller immediately seized on the opportunity to monopolize the oil, chemical and medical industries all at the same time!\n\nThe best thing about petrochemicals was that everything could be patented and sold for high profits.\n\nBut there was one problem with Rockefeller’s tyrannical plan for the medical industry: natural &amp; herbal medicines were very popular in America at that time. Almost half the doctors and medical colleges in the U.S. were practicing holistic medicine, using knowledge from Europe and Native Americans to heal patients.\n\nRockefeller, the monopolist, had to figure out a way to get rid of his biggest competition. So he used the classic strategy of “problem-reaction-solution.” \n\nHe went to his buddy Andrew Carnegie – another plutocrat who made his money from monopolizing the steel industry – who devised a scheme.

Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders are systematically attempting to normalize pedophilia and decriminalize sex with children across the world.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt’s happening right before our very eyes and the mainstream media are complicit in their silence.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis week in Jacinda Ardern’s far-left New Zealand, a judge declared that 12-year-old children can consent to sex with adults. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNo need to hit rewind. You heard me correctly. The case in question featured a 45-year-old man whose defense centered on the claim that his 12-year-old victim “wanted it.” According to the middle-aged man, the 12-year-old girl pressured him for sex.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn the final days of the trial, Judge Earwaker addressed the issue of consent for a person under 16 years:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“But as for sexual intercourse, a person under 16 can give consent. You need to consider whether or not the consent was given based on the evidence you have.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOn Monday, Judge Earwaker closed the trial, urging the jury to stay “utterly dispassionate” when judging whether the Crown prosecution had proved its case or not. Keep in mind, we are talking about a man who confessed to having sex with a 12-year-old and justified it on the grounds she “wanted it.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“It is not enough for the Crown to persuade you that he is most likely guilty, it needs to be beyond a reasonable doubt.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nScary times in New Zealand. But are you surprised? We are talking about a far-left authoritarian state, led by Young Global Leader Jacinda Ardern, where citizens are being told to put their total trust in government.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNew Zealand has fallen.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut they are not the only ones.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEmmanuel Macron was re-elected as president of France earlier this year in an election widely regarded as suspect. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt’s perhaps no surprise that he is also one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders and France is also normalizing pedophilia.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPresident Macron’s government voted against having an age of consent in France in 2018, becoming one of the first nations to give in to pressure from an international cabal determined to decriminalize sex with children across the world.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis means federal law in France has no legal age of consent, and adults who have sex with children of any age will not be prosecuted for rape if the child victim is unable to prove “violence, threat, duress, or surprise.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe draft bill against sexual and gender-based violence was signed into law by the French Parliament on 3 August, sparking outrage in France as parents and children’s rights groups accused Macron’s government of betraying the nation’s children.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe lack of an age of consent places millions of children in serious danger of sexual abuse in France, according to child protection officials.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLike Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, Macron is one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders. They are all hell-bent on waging war against our children.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLove him or loathe him, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned us years ago that the global elite plan to normalize pedophilia in the West. According to Putin, the global elite engage in Satan worship. “Do as thou wilt” is their motto.

Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders are systematically attempting to normalize pedophilia and decriminalize sex with children across the world.\n\nIt’s happening right before our very eyes and the mainstream media are complicit in their silence.\n\nThis week in Jacinda Ardern’s far-left New Zealand, a judge declared that 12-year-old children can consent to sex with adults. \n\nNo need to hit rewind. You heard me correctly. The case in question featured a 45-year-old man whose defense centered on the claim that his 12-year-old victim “wanted it.” According to the middle-aged man, the 12-year-old girl pressured him for sex.\n\nIn the final days of the trial, Judge Earwaker addressed the issue of consent for a person under 16 years:\n\n“But as for sexual intercourse, a person under 16 can give consent. You need to consider whether or not the consent was given based on the evidence you have.”\n\nOn Monday, Judge Earwaker closed the trial, urging the jury to stay “utterly dispassionate” when judging whether the Crown prosecution had proved its case or not. Keep in mind, we are talking about a man who confessed to having sex with a 12-year-old and justified it on the grounds she “wanted it.”\n\n“It is not enough for the Crown to persuade you that he is most likely guilty, it needs to be beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\nScary times in New Zealand. But are you surprised? We are talking about a far-left authoritarian state, led by Young Global Leader Jacinda Ardern, where citizens are being told to put their total trust in government.\n\nNew Zealand has fallen.\n\nBut they are not the only ones.\n\nEmmanuel Macron was re-elected as president of France earlier this year in an election widely regarded as suspect. \n\nIt’s perhaps no surprise that he is also one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders and France is also normalizing pedophilia.\n\nPresident Macron’s government voted against having an age of consent in France in 2018, becoming one of the first nations to give in to pressure from an international cabal determined to decriminalize sex with children across the world.\n\nThis means federal law in France has no legal age of consent, and adults who have sex with children of any age will not be prosecuted for rape if the child victim is unable to prove “violence, threat, duress, or surprise.”\n\nThe draft bill against sexual and gender-based violence was signed into law by the French Parliament on 3 August, sparking outrage in France as parents and children’s rights groups accused Macron’s government of betraying the nation’s children.\n\nThe lack of an age of consent places millions of children in serious danger of sexual abuse in France, according to child protection officials.\n\nLike Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, Macron is one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders. They are all hell-bent on waging war against our children.\n\nLove him or loathe him, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned us years ago that the global elite plan to normalize pedophilia in the West. According to Putin, the global elite engage in Satan worship. “Do as thou wilt” is their motto. It appears he was correct.\n\nI said earlier that the mainstream media is complicit in its silence. More interested in promoting Big Pharma products and acting as the PR Department of the Democrat Party, the media appears completely uninterested in the real world issues that have a direct influence on the lives of our children.\n\nBut when you scratch the surface, you realize the media is complicit in more ways than simply turning a blind eye.\n\nThe attempt to normalize pedophilia has been playing out before our very eyes for years.

They want to shame those among us who dare to ask questions and question the official narrative.\n\nAsk yourself, when was the last time the media unearthed a conspiracy? \n\nAlso ask yourself, when was the last time the media covered up a conspiracy?\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 4, 2022 9:29 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn\" data-date=\"1659558698\" data-video-id=\"Q-obrXE3B2g\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-obrXE3B2g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q-obrXE3B2g/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"Q-obrXE3B2g\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-obrXE3B2g\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.

Much like anything else, politics and money have been used to warp people’s minds and encourage them to embrace what is bad for them.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt all began with John D. Rockefeller who was an oil magnate, a robber baron, America’s first billionaire, and a natural-born monopolist.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBy the turn on the 20th century, he controlled 90% of all oil refineries in the U.S. through his oil company, Standard Oil, which was later on broken up. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAround that same time, scientists discovered “petrochemicals” and the ability to create all kinds of chemicals from oil.

Much like anything else, politics and money have been used to warp people’s minds and encourage them to embrace what is bad for them.\n\nIt all began with John D. Rockefeller who was an oil magnate, a robber baron, America’s first billionaire, and a natural-born monopolist.\n\nBy the turn on the 20th century, he controlled 90% of all oil refineries in the U.S. through his oil company, Standard Oil, which was later on broken up. \n\nAround that same time, scientists discovered “petrochemicals” and the ability to create all kinds of chemicals from oil. Scientists were discovering that many pharmaceutical drugs could be made from oil.\n\nRockefeller immediately seized on the opportunity to monopolize the oil, chemical and medical industries all at the same time!\n\nThe best thing about petrochemicals was that everything could be patented and sold for high profits.\n\nBut there was one problem with Rockefeller’s tyrannical plan for the medical industry: natural &amp; herbal medicines were very popular in America at that time.

Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders are systematically attempting to normalize pedophilia and decriminalize sex with children across the world.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt’s happening right before our very eyes and the mainstream media are complicit in their silence.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis week in Jacinda Ardern’s far-left New Zealand, a judge declared that 12-year-old children can consent to sex with adults. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNo need to hit rewind. You heard me correctly. The case in question featured a 45-year-old man whose defense centered on the claim that his 12-year-old victim “wanted it.” According to the middle-aged man, the 12-year-old girl pressured him for sex.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn the final days of the trial, Judge Earwaker addressed the issue of consent for a person under 16 years:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“But as for sexual intercourse, a person under 16 can give consent. You need to consider whether or not the consent was given based on the evidence you have.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOn Monday, Judge Earwaker closed the trial, urging the jury to stay “utterly dispassionate” when judging whether the Crown prosecution had proved its case or not. Keep in mind, we are talking about a man who confessed to having sex with a 12-year-old and justified it on the grounds she “wanted it.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n“It is not enough for the Crown to persuade you that he is most likely guilty, it needs to be beyond a reasonable doubt.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nScary times in New Zealand. But are you surprised? We are talking about a far-left authoritarian state, led by Young Global Leader Jacinda Ardern, where citizens are being told to put their total trust in government.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNew Zealand has fallen.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBut they are not the only ones.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEmmanuel Macron was re-elected as president of France earlier this year in an election widely regarded as suspect. &lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt’s perhaps no surprise that he is also one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders and France is also normalizing pedophilia.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPresident Macron’s government voted against having an age of consent in France in 2018, becoming one of the first nations to give in to pressure from an international cabal determined to decriminalize sex with children across the world.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis means federal law in France has no legal age of consent, and adults who have sex with children of any age will not be prosecuted for rape if the child victim is unable to prove “violence, threat, duress, or surprise.”&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe draft bill against sexual and gender-based violence was signed into law by the French Parliament on 3 August, sparking outrage in France as parents and children’s rights groups accused Macron’s government of betraying the nation’s children.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe lack of an age of consent places millions of children in serious danger of sexual abuse in France, according to child protection officials.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLike Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, Macron is one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders. They are all hell-bent on waging war against our children.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLove him or loathe him, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned us years ago that the global elite plan to normalize pedophilia in the West.

Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders are systematically attempting to normalize pedophilia and decriminalize sex with children across the world.\n\nIt’s happening right before our very eyes and the mainstream media are complicit in their silence.\n\nThis week in Jacinda Ardern’s far-left New Zealand, a judge declared that 12-year-old children can consent to sex with adults. \n\nNo need to hit rewind. You heard me correctly. The case in question featured a 45-year-old man whose defense centered on the claim that his 12-year-old victim “wanted it.” According to the middle-aged man, the 12-year-old girl pressured him for sex.\n\nIn the final days of the trial, Judge Earwaker addressed the issue of consent for a person under 16 years:\n\n“But as for sexual intercourse, a person under 16 can give consent. You need to consider whether or not the consent was given based on the evidence you have.”\n\nOn Monday, Judge Earwaker closed the trial, urging the jury to stay “utterly dispassionate” when judging whether the Crown prosecution had proved its case or not. Keep in mind, we are talking about a man who confessed to having sex with a 12-year-old and justified it on the grounds she “wanted it.”\n\n“It is not enough for the Crown to persuade you that he is most likely guilty, it needs to be beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\nScary times in New Zealand. But are you surprised? We are talking about a far-left authoritarian state, led by Young Global Leader Jacinda Ardern, where citizens are being told to put their total trust in government.\n\nNew Zealand has fallen.\n\nBut they are not the only ones.\n\nEmmanuel Macron was re-elected as president of France earlier this year in an election widely regarded as suspect. \n\nIt’s perhaps no surprise that he is also one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders and France is also normalizing pedophilia.\n\nPresident Macron’s government voted against having an age of consent in France in 2018, becoming one of the first nations to give in to pressure from an international cabal determined to decriminalize sex with children across the world.\n\nThis means federal law in France has no legal age of consent, and adults who have sex with children of any age will not be prosecuted for rape if the child victim is unable to prove “violence, threat, duress, or surprise.”\n\nThe draft bill against sexual and gender-based violence was signed into law by the French Parliament on 3 August, sparking outrage in France as parents and children’s rights groups accused Macron’s government of betraying the nation’s children.\n\nThe lack of an age of consent places millions of children in serious danger of sexual abuse in France, according to child protection officials.\n\nLike Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, Macron is one of Klaus Schwab’s Young Global Leaders. They are all hell-bent on waging war against our children.\n\nLove him or loathe him, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned us years ago that the global elite plan to normalize pedophilia in the West. According to Putin, the global elite engage in Satan worship. “Do as thou wilt” is their motto. It appears he was correct.\n\nI said earlier that the mainstream media is complicit in its silence.

They want to shame those among us who dare to ask questions and question the official narrative.\n\nAsk yourself, when was the last time the media unearthed a conspiracy? \n\nAlso ask yourself, when was the last time the media covered up a conspiracy?\">\n\n                <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover sby_item_video_thumbnail_hover\">\n                    <div class=\"sby_thumbnail_hover_inner\">\n                                                <span class=\"sby_video_title\">UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;</span>\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <span class=\"sby-screenreader\">YouTube Video VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLjdVUkVMSUpzYmxZ</span>\n                                    <div class=\"sby_play_btn\">\n                        <span class=\"sby_play_btn_bg\"></span>\n                                        </div>\n                                <span class=\"sby_loader sby_hidden\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"></span>\n            </a>\n\n            \n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"sby_info sby_info_item\">\n\n			<p class=\"sby_video_title_wrap\">\n			<span class=\"sby_video_title\">UN Declares Conspiracy Theorists &quot;Public Enemy no.1&quot;</span>\n		</p>\n	\n			<p class=\"sby_meta\">\n\n													<span class=\"sby_date_wrap\">\n                <span class=\"sby_date sby_live_broadcast_type_none\">August 4, 2022 9:29 pm</span>\n            </span>\n					</p>\n	\n	\n	\n</div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sby_item  sby_new sby_transition sby_no_margin\" id=\"sby_VVV6MkVGRnQxczFuc091bmhwRnNHQk9RLlEtb2JyWEUzQjJn\" data-date=\"1659558698\" data-video-id=\"Q-obrXE3B2g\" data-video-title=\"Tesla’s Greatest Inventions Promised ‘Bright Future’ For Humanity Until the Elite Destroyed Them\" data-live-date=\"0\">\n    <div class=\"sby_inner_item\">\n        <div class=\"sby_video_thumbnail_wrap sby_item_video_thumbnail_wrap\">\n            <a class=\"sby_video_thumbnail sby_item_video_thumbnail\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-obrXE3B2g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-full-res=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q-obrXE3B2g/maxresdefault.jpg\" data-img-src-set=\"{&quot;120&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/default.jpg&quot;,&quot;320&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/mqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;480&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;640&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/i.ytimg.com\\/vi\\/Q-obrXE3B2g\\/sddefault.jpg&quot;}\" data-video-id=\"Q-obrXE3B2g\" data-user=\"The People&#039;s Voice\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-obrXE3B2g\" data-avatar=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AMLnZu-uX06WSvndT9YY756PSkup7_U9OLwPlZYr-0QkTg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj\" data-title=\"Nikola Tesla was way ahead of his time.
