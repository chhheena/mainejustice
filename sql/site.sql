It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

international experts that failed to conclude how the virus first broke out.<\\/p>\\n<p>But Chinese officials have resisted this, brushing off claims by US President Joe Biden that China was

Still, health experts contend that the ongoing hospitalizations and deaths are burdening overstretched hospitals and could be reduced with basic measures.<\\/p>\\n<p>Tim Spector, a professor at King\\u2019s College London, who has been leading a major study of Covid symptoms since the start of the pandemic, said it is hard to predict whether high levels of transmission will continue. One reason for the uncertainty, he said, is that public behavior, led by government guidance, is very different now than in previous surges. \\u201cIn past waves, there\\u2019s been a general panic and reduction in mobility,\\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe trouble is that the government has gone from \\u2018operation fear\\u2019 that we had a year ago to \\u2018operation complacency,\\u2019\\u201d Spector said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a massive switch.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p><a class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/indianexpress.com\\/article\\/world\\/uk-coronavirus-tracker-region-wise-cases-and-deaths-6373786\\/\\\">England<\\/a>\\u00a0has some of the loosest coronavirus protections in Europe since July 19, when it lifted all legal restrictions, including mandatory mask-wearing. In a recent survey by YouGov and Imperial College London, 21% of Britons said they rarely or never wear a face mask in public \\u2014 about four times as many as in Italy and Spain.<\\/p>\\n<p>Despite the extended surge in cases, the UK\\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies recently said that behaviors in Britain are closer to pre-pandemic levels than at any time since March 2020.<\\/p>\\n<p>The current surge is being primarily driven by high levels of infection in school-age children, with more than one-third of all recent cases being reported in those younger than 15.<\\/p>\\n<p>Unlike most of Europe, the UK was slow to approve vaccines for adolescents. The recommendation of a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds was not announced until mid-September \\u2014 weeks after many students had returned to school from summer vacation. So far, just 21% of 12- to 15-year-olds are vaccinated in England, compared with 80% of adults.<\\/p>\\n<p>Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London, said the lag in approval of vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds was an enormous mistake.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve had an extra 10% or 20% of kids infected when they didn\\u2019t need to be, and we\\u2019re dealing with the hospitalizations and deaths that came from that,\\u201d Pagel said. \\u201cAnd with long Covid, even if that affects 5% of them, that\\u2019s a lot of kids.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>These infections have started to spread into older age groups in recent weeks, and overall in England, about 20% of beds in intensive care units are filled with Covid patients. Experts warn that the National Health Service could face intense pressure this winter.<\\/p>\\n<p>Experts agree that Covid vaccine booster doses \\u2014 an additional shot given once the protection from the initial inoculation starts to decline \\u2014 are going to be essential to reduce demand on hospitals in the coming months. A recent study from Public Health England found that protection against symptomatic infection drops significantly in the five months after a second vaccine dose.<\\/p>\\n<p>The study found the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\\u2019s effectiveness at preventing symptomatic infection from the\\u00a0<a class=\\\"\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/indianexpress.com\\/article\\/explained\\/covid-delta-variant-coronavirus-cases-7344758\\/\\\">delta variant<\\/a>\\u00a0dropped to 70% after five months from 90% two weeks after full immunization. Waning immunity was more severe for those who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine; five months after being administered, its effectiveness dropped to 47% from 67%.<\\/p>\\n<p>Booster doses are currently being rolled out to everyone ages 50 and above in Britain, as well as health care workers and the clinically vulnerable, six months after their second doses. So far, 6.7 million booster doses, or enough to cover 10% of the total population, have been administered.<\\/p>\\n<p>The UK\\u2019s high case rates had been an outlier in Western Europe in recent weeks, as infections in France, Germany and Spain all plateaued at low levels. But rising cases in Germany hint that Britain\\u2019s woes could spread across the continent this winter, with fears that waning immunity and increased indoor mixing will fuel further infection.<\\/p>\\n<p>The British government has so far resisted calls to invoke its \\u201cPlan B\\u201d for suppressing infections over the winter. That protocol would include vaccine passes for nightclubs, mandatory face coverings and a push for those who can to work from home.<\\/p>\\n<p>At a recent news conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said although the NHS is under increasing pressure, he believed the current lack of restrictions remained appropriate. \\u201cIf we feel at any point it\\u2019s becoming unsustainable, then we won\\u2019t hesitate to act,\\u201d he added.<\\/p>\\n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association, in a recent statement pressed for more urgent action. He said the NHS is heading into winter with a \\u201cdepleted and exhausted workforce\\u201d and called on the government to enact its \\u201cPlan B\\u201d measures now to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed.<\\/p>\\n<p>Case rates have fallen in the UK in the past few days, although it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue once children return to school next week after a midsemester break. Pagel said she hoped the brief vacation from school would serve as a break in transmission. Still, she warned, \\u201cEven if cases do start declining, they\\u2019re not going to go down super fast. If we added in masks and home working, we could make them go down quicker, so why aren\\u2019t we doing that?\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"non-city-story-widget\\\">\\u00a0She added: \\u201cLast winter was awful, and we shouldn\\u2019t get anywhere near that level before raising alarm bells.\\u201d<\\/div>\\n<p>Source:\\u00a0\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/indianexpress.com\\/article\\/world\\/children-drive-britain-longest-covid-19-surge-7599935\\/\\\">https:\\/\\/indianexpress.com\\/article\\/world\\/children-drive-britain-longest-covid-19-surge-7599935\\/<\\/a>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"104\",\"created\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"created_by\":\"82\",\"created_by_alias\":null,\"modified\":\"2021-11-09 12:25:04\",\"modified_by\":\"82\",\"checked_out\":0,\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_associations\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_page_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image\\\":\\\"images\\\\\\/2021\\\\\\/10\\\\\\/31\\\\\\/UK-Virus.jpg\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_format\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"gallery\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"audio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_url\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_text\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_status\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"8\",\"ordering\":1,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"10\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":1,\"language\":\"*\",\"xreference\":null}', '0'),

However, using the above definition, common sense, the laws of logic and the dictates of science, any unbiased person must come to the conclusion that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has\\u00a0<i>never<\\/i>\\u00a0been isolated or purified. As a result, no confirmation of the virus\\u2019 existence can be found. The logical, common sense, and scientific consequences of this fact are:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the structure and composition of something not shown to exist can\\u2019t be known, including the presence, structure, and function of any hypothetical spike or other proteins;<\\/li>\\n<li>the genetic sequence of something that has never been found can\\u2019t be known;<\\/li>\\n<li>\\u201cvariants\\u201d of something that hasn\\u2019t been shown to exist can\\u2019t be known;<\\/li>\\n<li>it\\u2019s impossible to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease called Covid-19.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>In as concise terms as possible, here\\u2019s the proper way to isolate, characterize and demonstrate a new virus. First, one takes samples (blood, sputum, secretions) from many people (e.g. 500) with symptoms which are unique and specific enough to characterize an illness. Without mixing these samples with ANY tissue or products that also contain genetic material, the virologist macerates, filters and ultracentrifuges i.e.\\u00a0<i>purifies<\\/i>\\u00a0the specimen. This common virology technique, done for decades to isolate bacteriophages<sup>1<\\/sup>\\u00a0and so-called giant viruses in every virology lab, then allows the virologist to demonstrate with electron microscopy thousands of identically sized and shaped particles. These particles are the isolated and purified virus.<\\/p>\\n<p>These identical particles are then checked for uniformity by physical and\\/or microscopic techniques. Once the purity is determined, the particles may be further characterized. This would include examining the structure, morphology, and chemical composition of the particles. Next, their genetic makeup is characterized by extracting the genetic material directly from the purified particles and using genetic-sequencing techniques, such as Sanger sequencing, that have also been around for decades. Then one does an analysis to confirm that these uniform particles are exogenous (outside) in origin as a virus is conceptualized to be, and not the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues.<sup>2<\\/sup>\\u00a0(As of May 2020, we know that virologists have no way to determine whether the particles they\\u2019re seeing are viruses or just normal break-down products of dead and dying tissues.)<sup>3<\\/sup>\\u00a0<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-element elementor-element-1e8edf5 ob-harakiri-inherit elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\\\" data-id=\\\"1e8edf5\\\" data-element_type=\\\"widget\\\" data-settings=\\\"{&quot;_ob_harakiri_writing_mode&quot;:&quot;inherit&quot;,&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\\\" data-widget_type=\\\"text-editor.default\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-widget-container\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\\\">\\n<p><em><sup>1<\\/sup>\\u00a0Isolation, characterization and analysis of bacteriophages from the haloalkaline lake Elmenteita, KenyaJuliah Khayeli Akhwale et al, PLOS One, Published: April 25, 2019.\\u00a0<a title=\\\"https:\\/\\/journals.plos.org\\/plosone\\/article?id=10.1371\\/journal.pone.0215734\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/journals.plos.org\\/plosone\\/article?id=10.1371\\/journal.pone.0215734\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">https:\\/\\/journals.plos.org\\/plosone\\/article?id=10.1371\\/journal.pone.0215734<\\/a>\\u00a0\\u2014 accessed 2\\/15\\/21<\\/em><br \\/><em><sup>2<\\/sup>\\u00a0\\u201cExtracellular Vesicles Derived From Apoptotic Cells: An Essential Link Between Death and Regeneration,\\u201d Maojiao Li1 et al, Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2020 October 2.\\u00a0<a title=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/fcell.2020.573511\\/full\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/fcell.2020.573511\\/full\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/fcell.2020.573511\\/full<\\/a>\\u00a0\\u2014 accessed 2\\/15\\/21<\\/em><br \\/><em><sup>3<\\/sup>\\u00a0\\u201cThe Role of Extracellular Vesicles as Allies of HIV, HCV and SARS Viruses,\\u201d Flavia Giannessi, et al, Viruses, 2020 May<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"elementor-element elementor-element-c0ceae5 elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\\\" data-id=\\\"c0ceae5\\\" data-element_type=\\\"widget\\\" data-settings=\\\"{&quot;_ob_perspektive_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_shadough_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_allow_hoveranimator&quot;:&quot;no&quot;,&quot;_ob_widget_stalker_use&quot;:&quot;no&quot;}\\\" data-widget_type=\\\"divider.default\\\">If we have come this far then we have fully isolated, characterized, and genetically sequenced an exogenous virus particle. However, we still have to show it is causally related to a disease. This is carried out by exposing a group of healthy subjects (animals are usually used) to this isolated, purified virus in the manner in which the disease is thought to be transmitted. If the animals get sick with the same disease, as confirmed by clinical and autopsy findings, one has now shown that the virus actually causes a disease.

Our research indicates that a single study showing these steps does not exist in the medical literature.<\\/p>\\n<p>Instead, since 1954, virologists have taken unpurified samples from a relatively few people, often less than ten, with a similar disease. They then minimally process this sample and inoculate this unpurified sample onto tissue culture containing usually four to six other types of material \\u2014\\u00a0<strong>all of which contain identical genetic material as to what is called a \\u201cvirus.\\u201d<\\/strong>\\u00a0The tissue culture is starved and poisoned and naturally disintegrates into many types of particles, some of which contain genetic material. Against all common sense, logic, use of the English language and scientific integrity, this process is called \\u201cvirus isolation.\\u201d This brew containing fragments of genetic material from many sources is then subjected to genetic analysis, which then creates in a computer-simulation process the alleged sequence of the alleged virus, a so called\\u00a0<em>in silico genome<\\/em>. At no time is an actual virus confirmed by electron microscopy. At no time is a genome extracted and sequenced from an actual virus. This is scientific fraud.<\\/p>\\n<p>The observation that the unpurified specimen \\u2014 inoculated onto tissue culture along with toxic antibiotics, bovine fetal tissue, amniotic fluid and other tissues \\u2014 destroys the kidney tissue onto which it is inoculated is given as evidence of the virus\\u2019 existence and pathogenicity. This is scientific fraud.<\\/p>\\n<p>From now on, when anyone gives you a paper that suggests the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated, please check the methods sections. If the researchers used Vero cells or any other culture method, you know that their process was not isolation. You will hear the following excuses for why actual isolation isn\\u2019t done:<\\/p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>There were not enough virus particles found in samples from patients to analyze.<\\/li>\\n<li>Viruses are intracellular parasites; they can\\u2019t be found outside the cell in this manner.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ol>\\n<p>If No. 1 is correct, and we can\\u2019t find the virus in the sputum of sick people, then on what evidence do we think the virus is dangerous or even lethal? If No. 2 is correct, then how is the virus spread from person to person? We are told it emerges from the cell to infect others. Then why isn\\u2019t it possible to find it?<\\/p>\\n<p>Finally, questioning these virology techniques and conclusions is not some distraction or divisive issue. Shining the light on this truth is essential to stop this terrible fraud that humanity is confronting. For, as we now know, if the virus has never been isolated, sequenced or shown to cause illness, if the virus is imaginary, then why are we wearing masks, social distancing and putting the whole world into prison?<\\/p>\\n<p>Finally, if pathogenic viruses don\\u2019t exist, then what is going into those injectable devices erroneously called \\u201cvaccines,\\u201d and what is their purpose? This scientific question is the most urgent and relevant one of our time.<\\/p>\\n<p>We are correct.

My colleague and I are working on a story about false or misleading vaccine misinformation in the audio space ... You have said on Facebook that the vaccine \'doesn\'t work\' and is \'a complete failure.\' Do you have any comment?\\\"<\\/p>\",\"fulltext\":\"<p>I want to share my response to The New York Times:<\\/p>\\n<p>Sure, I have a comment. Every word I say is based on science and facts.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the only present scientific way of measuring deaths and injuries from any vaccine \\u2014 including the COVID-19 vaccine. It\'s not my system. It\'s not based on politics. It has nothing to do with conservative or liberal opinions.<\\/p>\\n<p>It is a science-based medical reporting system provided by the government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<\\/p>\\n<p>It is the only way of keeping track of deaths, crippling injuries and adverse reactions from any vaccine. It has been used for many decades.<\\/p>\\n<p>No one in the medical community or media has EVER in history ignored or disparaged VAERS before \\u2014 until now.<\\/p>\\n<p>Here are the VAERS numbers: Over 17,000 Americans are reported dead from this vaccine \\u2014 mostly from strokes, heart attacks and blood clots. Over 800,000 are reported injured, many of them hospitalized (over 83,000), many with life-threatening illness (over 18,000) and many others permanently disabled (over 26,000).<\\/p>\\n<p>This information is all publicly available and provided by the CDC. This cannot be called \\\"misleading\\\" by anyone in the media. The very definition of \\\"misleading\\\" would be to either disparage or ignore VAERS and not report on it daily to your readers.<\\/p>\\n<p>The number of deaths and significant injuries reported to VAERS is now dramatically higher than in the past 30-plus years combined. This has happened in only 10 months.<\\/p>\\n<p>That\'s a fact. Facts cannot be \\\"misleading.\\\"<\\/p>\\n<p>Several times in America\'s recent history, the medical community has suspended or canceled a vaccine program over a small number of deaths. The first rule of medicine is \\\"physician do no harm.\\\" At any sign of harm, a vaccine should and must be questioned and\\/or suspended.<\\/p>\\n<p>Never before have we even imagined a vaccine would be linked to over 17,000 deaths and over 800,000 adverse reactions.<\\/p>\\n<p>Yet, the official VAERS numbers have been blacked out from the mainstream media and social media \\u2014 including your New York Times. Any time something is not discussed or debated and is disparaged as \\\"misleading\\\" because it is different from the official government narrative, I\'d call that the very definition of \\\"intolerance\\\" at best, and tyranny at worst.<\\/p>\\n<p>Even more facts and SCIENCE ...<\\/p>\\n<p>Studies are in from many countries, but in particular the U.K. and Israel, reporting:<\\/p>\\n<p>No. 1: The vaccine is in fact failing miserably \\u2014 a huge majority of recent cases, hospitalizations and deaths are among double vaccinated individuals. FACT.<\\/p>\\n<p>No. 2: Cases are slightly higher in countries with higher vaccination rates, and slightly lower in countries with lower vaccination rates.<\\/p>\\n<p>These are factual, credible, scientific studies from multiple countries.<\\/p>\\n<p>So yes, I question this vaccine, and yes, I am seriously worried about the proven deaths and injuries directly from this vaccine in the short term (as seen on the VAERS reporting system), and I\'m especially worried about the long-term effects of this vaccine.<\\/p>\\n<p>If The New York Times believes anything I\'ve said is \\\"misleading,\\\" then you clearly don\'t understand the definition of \\\"science.\\\" I\'m quoting only government, CDC and scientific studies from multiple countries.<\\/p>\\n<p>More importantly, the very definition of \\\"science\\\" is asking questions and debating.<\\/p>\\n<p>To not ask questions, especially in the face of so many Americans sick with COVID-19 who are double vaccinated, and so many dead or injured directly from the vaccine as reported by VAERS, would make someone either naive, gullible, blind, deaf or very dumb.<\\/p>\\n<p>I\'m proud that my time at Columbia University taught me to think critically, ask questions, never accept as fact what any government agency or authority figure says and always be a fearless debater.<\\/p>\\n<p>By the way, I urge The New York Times to set up a debate on this topic. I\'ll be thrilled to debate any \\\"expert\\\" about this particular COVID-19 vaccine and the facts reported by VAERS and studies around the world. Let\'s do it.<\\/p>\\n<p>WAR<\\/p>\\n<p>Wayne Allyn Root<\\/p>\\n<p>P.S. After I sent this response, it was reported 77.7% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois last week were among vaccinated people. It was also reported Ireland has a massive COVID-19 outbreak, despite the country being 91% vaccinated. And an exhaustive yearlong study in the U.K. was released proving vaccinated people are just as likely to spread COVID-19 as the unvaccinated.<\\/p>\\n<p>The debate is over. The vaccine is a failure. The vaccine mandates must end now.<\\/p>\\n<p>Source:\\u00a0\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.creators.com\\/read\\/wayne-allyn-root\\\">https:\\/\\/www.creators.com\\/read\\/wayne-allyn-root<\\/a>\\u00a0<\\/p>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"107\",\"created\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"created_by\":\"82\",\"created_by_alias\":null,\"modified\":\"2021-11-09 12:25:04\",\"modified_by\":\"82\",\"checked_out\":0,\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"data\\\\\\/phocadownload\\\\\\/images\\\\\\/photos\\\\\\/7dad3be262e2359ed43c614ede38cfc7a460be79.jpg\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_associations\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_page_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image\\\":\\\"images\\\\\\/2021\\\\\\/10\\\\\\/31\\\\\\/7dad3be262e2359ed43c614ede38cfc7a460be79.jpg\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_format\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"gallery\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"audio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_url\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_text\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_status\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"18\",\"ordering\":1,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"18\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":1,\"language\":\"*\",\"xreference\":null}', '0'),

Messaging needed to be tailored to take into account different \\u201cmotivational levers.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Thus, the document suggested using both social approval and disapproval, with government compulsion as a backup, as follows:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Option 6:<\\/strong>\\u00a0Use and promote social approval for desired behaviors.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Option 7:<\\/strong>\\u00a0Consider enacting legislation to compel required behaviors.<\\/li>\\n<li><strong>Option 8:<\\/strong>\\u00a0Consider use of social disapproval for failure to comply.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>As if on cue, the \\u201cheroes and covidiots\\u201d narrative began to appear in the \\u201cnews.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The word \\u201ccovidiots\\u201d was coined in spring 2020 by The Economist, the official magazine of the world\\u2019s most elite globalists. The magazine described \\u201ccovidiots\\u201d as follows:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"wp-block-quote\\\">\\n<p>\\u201cThe term \\u201ccovidiot\\u201d describes any and every person behaving stupidly or irresponsibly as the epidemic spreads. Sometime in early March the word was born, and, almost as fast as the virus spread, so did instances of covidiotic behavior.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<\\/blockquote>\\n<p>The U.S. government was party to similar discussions about how to control the media narrative about COVID at Event 201 in October 2019, two months before the virus was discovered in China.<\\/p>\\n<p>In Germany, equally insidious propaganda strategies have been documented within the so-called \\u201c<strong>Panic Paper<\\/strong>,\\u201d a leaked document from the German Department of Interior that shows the population was deliberately driven to panic by politicians and mainstream media.<\\/p>\\n<p>Among other things, the Panic Paper calls for\\u00a0<strong>children to be made to feel responsible \\u201cfor the painful tortured death of their parents and grandparents if they do not follow the corona rules,\\u201d<\\/strong>\\u00a0that is, if they do not constantly wash their hands, put on masks and avoid contact with their grandparents.<\\/p>\\n<p>Scientific data shows children are not efficient spreaders of the virus but that couldn\\u2019t be allowed to disrupt the fear-based narrative. They were masked and socially distanced, their schools shut down, their social lives destroyed, leading to a record number of teen suicides.<\\/p>\\n<p>It became obvious to Robinson that the extreme government responses had nothing to do with public health.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat has becoming increasingly clear is this is not being driven by a health crisis,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe are seeing profound changes in our society.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The changes include everything from the introduction of digital currencies and vaccine passports with scannable QR codes, to the regulation of worship services and small businesses.<\\/p>\\n<p>The World Economic Forum immediately seized on the COVID pandemic as an \\u201copportunity\\u201d to change the economic, political and social structure of the free world. Elites at the WEF, United Nations, the British Royal family, the Vatican, World Bank and International Monetary Fund did not hide their excitement about the \\u201copportunity\\u201d that came with a global pandemic. In fact they were very open about it, writing books, making speeches and participating in glitzy promotional videos posted to YouTube.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat we seem to have here are political actors exploiting the circumstances for political, economic and social objectives,\\u201d Robinson said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s certainly very clear for example, organizations such as the World Economic Forum had a very specific vision from the very beginning on how to respond to COVID and had a very specific vision for the future, talking about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, smart cities and so on, and it would appear that actors such as that are using and exploiting COVID for substantial political, economic and social restructuring.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The role of propaganda then becomes key because it conditions people to accept these drastic changes without any scrutiny or public debate, \\u201cbecause people are thinking this is all about a virus and people are scared. So all of the transformative changes are being swept through without any scrutiny. This is very, very dangerous. A terrified population has extracted a huge opportunity for people with agendas who have the power to realize that.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo we are moving into pretty worrying territory now, in terms of how governments are behaving.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Those who speak out against the propaganda start to be treated as the \\u201cother.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The virus now becomes an engine to drive society to vaccine passports, a digital ID system and a social-credit scoring system similar to what\\u2019s used in China to keep people toeing the government line.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll of these seem to revolve around a major restructuring of society, major redistribution of wealth, much more control, much less democracy,\\u201d Robinson said.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"has-text-align-center\\\"><strong>The role of the mask<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Laura Dodsworth, in her book\\u00a0<strong><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/State-Fear-government-weaponised-Covid-19-ebook\\/dp\\/B08ZSYN14J\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">A State of Fear: How the UK Government Weaponized Fear During the Covid-19 Pandemic<\\/a><\\/strong>, interviewed behavioral psychologists that work for the UK government.

It\\u2019s not about protecting people from a virus but managing their perception of the virus.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Governments set up snitchlines in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia, and throughout the formerly free world, further dividing their populations and turning friends and family against each other.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis concept of divide and control is becoming more apparent. We\\u2019re starting to see it over the last couple of weeks in terms of mandated vaccination,\\u201d Robison said.<\\/p>\\n<p>Headlines like this from the LA Times are commonplace, \\u201cCOVID-19 cases surge in L.A. County, fueled by \\u2018enormously selfish\\u2019 unvaccinated.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Often the media campaigns for even more restrictions than are currently put in place by the government, such as barring the unvaccinated from airline flights, restaurants, stores and basically every public venue, even outdoor sporting events and concerts.<\\/p>\\n<p>Blaming the unvaccinated for continued flare ups of the pandemic is everywhere.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis should ring alarm bells for anyone who has even the most basic grasp of history. You start to talk about segregation, you start to talk about people who are unclean, unhealthy, unvaccinated versus vaccinated,\\u201d Robinson said.<\\/p>\\n<p>None of these policies is based on scientific data.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll of the level-headed epidemiologists that I listen to are very clear that this idea that the unvaccinated spread the virus is not accurate scientifically, but that is the kind of message which is being communicated by people who have been pushing the agenda from the beginning,\\u201d Robinson said. \\u201cAnd that will create divisions, and we\\u2019ve been in this kind of place in history and it ends very badly when we start segregating people and we start using that language. But, quite terrifyingly, this is the language which is being used by the people who have been pushing draconian restrictions, vaccines, for the last two years.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Former Fox News commentator Piers Morgan, for example, took to Twitter last week and suggested that the\\u00a0<strong><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.vaccinewars.com\\/2021-08-05-morgan-calls-for-unvaccinated-to-be-denied-treatment.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">unvaccinated should be denied medical treatment<\\/a><\\/strong>.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe know from history this kind of talk can lead to very, very dark places,\\u201d said Robinson. \\u201cMany of the things we are seeing, the need to carry special passports for instance, have parallels in 1930s Germany.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery credible, eminent scientists, are now being smeared in the media because of their anti-lockdown views or for questioning the Covid vaccines. The casual smearing is certainly a big part of what\\u2019s going on. This should be another warning sign to those who think everything is OK and there are no problems out there. People should ask themselves, why are very eminent scientists from the beginning [<em>like Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Robert Malone<\\/em>] being smeared and being censored and shut down and shut out from debates? That tells you something. That tells you this isn\\u2019t a rational response that\\u2019s going on. This is a propagandized response. And it\\u2019s being carried through by shutting people up, by humiliating them, smearing them and so on.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\\"has-text-align-center\\\"><strong>All institutions complicit in the propaganda<\\/strong>\\u00a0<strong>war<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Mainstream journalists operate in close proximity to people in political power. They frequent the same groups and social gatherings.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey share basically the same outlook,\\u201d Robinson noted. \\u201cThey depend on each other for information. So journalists are not as critical as they should be and not as independent as they should be. So it shouldn\\u2019t surprise us that when it comes to Covid, they are reluctant to go against the government narrative.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Those in academia also tend to self-censor. They come up against pressure within institutions to \\u201cstay within the program,\\u201d leading to a groupthink mentality.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe are seeing lawmakers, parliaments being incredibly timid, and not engaging in the kind of democratic scrutiny that they should be,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo I think we\\u2019re seeing all of the institutions in our society being bent to this propaganda campaign.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He said hope lies in new political parties that are rising against the establishment, but it\\u2019s too early to tell if they will gain the traction needed to turn back the tide of authoritarianism in nations that have a long history of freedom.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost of our democratic institutions are hollowed out. We need to get democracy back,\\u201d Robinson said.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Those fighting for the resistance have a small window to get their message out, educate the public and stem the tide.<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn all my life I have never experienced anything as worrying and as extreme as what we\\u2019re seeing at the moment,\\u201d Robinson said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to be able to rely on your local politician or the mainstream media to suddenly pick up this issue. We\\u2019re in a phase where people need to mobilize, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re seeing. And that means not relying on your mainstream or established political parties.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>The growing protest movements in France and Italy will need to continue to intensify and spread beyond Europe if they are going to be successful.<\\/p>\\n<p>People must get out and start organizing and communicating with like-minded groups. That\\u2019s the key, as Robinson sees it.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe will have to see how this develops, the people getting out in the streets and the new political parties representing those views. Will that start to change the course of what we\\u2019re seeing?\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Robinson\\u2019s gut feeling is that it will, but one can sense his hesitancy to become too optimistic.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI sort of have a feeling in my own heart, maybe just my instinct, that it\\u2019s so extreme what is being proposed: lockdowns, and vaccinating children, people being forced to vaccinate. This is so extreme that as this goes on, the numbers who are willing to organize and join new parties will increase.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t see for sure what is going to happen. My guestimate at the moment, is the propaganda around Covid 19 is quite a fragile bubble.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn my career researching and exposing propaganda I\\u2019ve never seen this number of people who are waking up.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll the alarm bells are ringing with anyone who has a knowledge of history, and a knowledge of propaganda, how governments don\\u2019t always operate in the best interests of their populations. All the alarm bells are ringing, and we are in extremely dangerous times, unfortunately, and very worrying for the future.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>So what is the end game?<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are some great investigative journalists out there, who have reported on the World Economic Forum and the idea that the end game is a restructuring of society which involves more control over individuals and their lives by the state,\\u201d Robinson said.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are many theories out there. But one thing is clear; this all seems to be driving toward a real end to proper freedom. If you have a vaccination passport which you need to get into your supermarket, you\\u2019re not actually free anymore.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Digital currencies are another thing that seems to be in the offing.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis gives a tremendous shift in power to governments,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is all pretty anti-democratic. If you think democracy and freedom are generally good things, and I\\u2019m one of them who does, this is all extremely concerning.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe are at a pivotal moment\\u2026it could go either way. That\\u2019s why people must mobilize and realize something is wrong beyond COVID-19.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>As for the QR codes on the vaccine passports, \\u201cwe should have all learned a lesson after 9\\/11, with the Patriot Act, surveillance, monitoring everything, and governments, if they can get away with it, will exploit all of this.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Seeing the writing on the wall, some resisters are already talking about buying swaths of land and forming self-supporting communities that exist off the grid.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cHopefully,\\u201d Robinson mused, \\u201cit isn\\u2019t coming to that.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>[<i>Editor\'s note: This story originally was published by\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/leohohmann.com\\/2021\\/08\\/10\\/renowned-propaganda-expert-worst-is-still-to-come-in-global-psy-op-if-people-do-not-rise-up-and-resist\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer\\\">LeoHohmann.com<\\/a>.<\\/i>]<\\/p>\\n<p>Source:\\u00a0\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.wnd.com\\/2021\\/08\\/propaganda-expert-warns-global-covid-psyop\\/\\\">https:\\/\\/www.wnd.com\\/2021\\/08\\/propaganda-expert-warns-global-covid-psyop\\/<\\/a>\\u00a0<\\/p>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"107\",\"created\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"created_by\":\"82\",\"created_by_alias\":null,\"modified\":\"2021-11-09 12:25:04\",\"modified_by\":\"82\",\"checked_out\":0,\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2021-10-28 07:34:04\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_associations\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_page_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image\\\":\\\"images\\\\\\/2021\\\\\\/10\\\\\\/31\\\\\\/surveillance-spying-watching-masks-covid-coronavirus-screens-taiwan-military-defense.jpg\\\",\\\"spfeatured_image_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_format\\\":\\\"standard\\\",\\\"gallery\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"audio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"video\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_url\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_text\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"quote_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"post_status\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"9\",\"ordering\":1,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"7\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":1,\"language\":\"*\",\"xreference\":null}', '0'),

Dr. Rose is an expert in bio-mathematics and molecular research.<\\/p>\",\"fulltext\":\"<p>In January of 2021, she utilized her skills as a computational biologist and began analyzing data in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Each week, she downloaded publicly-available data sets from VAERS, comparing inputs week-to-week. She discovered that vaccine injury reports went missing from one week to the next. Each week, the data is updated in the VAERS system. She found that some of the data is overwritten, vanished from the system. She also found that \\u201chundreds of thousands\\u201d of covid vaccine injury reports were backlogged and did not appear in a timely manner to alert healthcare professionals to serious issues with the vaccine.<\\/p>\\n<h2>Hundreds of thousands of vaccine injury reports backlogged in VAERS<\\/h2>\\n<p>In the interview, Dr. Rose discussed the systemic flaws of the VAERS system, flaws that stop the passive reporting system from working in the public\\u2019s interest, as was originally intended. The pharmacovigilance system was set up in 1990 to detect issues with vaccines, to alert regulatory agencies and the public about serious adverse events and contraindications for specific vaccines. The data is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Healthcare professionals input the data into the system, and have a narrow thirty-minute window to complete the report. In 2021, healthcare workers have been overwhelmed with vaccine injury reports and have not had the time to enter them all into the system. Many medical concerns associated with the covid vaccine are overlooked, discarded or discounted as coincidental or normalized reactions\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/vaccinedamage.news\\/\\\">to the vaccine<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>The hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports that have been filed paint a grisly picture of medical malfeasance. These serious public health issues have yet to be addressed by any regulatory agency or judicial process. In the past, vaccines were pulled from the market if the VAERS system documented more than fifty deaths from a single vaccine. In 2021, there have been more than 20,000 deaths recorded in just ten months. Up to 97 percent of these issues are coming from the new mRNA covid vaccines, not the rest of the vaccine supply. Instead of pulling the deadly products from the market, the federal government has issued unlawful mandates, coercing individuals to take part in the depopulation experiment. This might be the biggest flaw with the system yet: The agencies that are supposed to oversee the data and alert the public to medical atrocities are the same entities trying to push a narrative forward \\u2013 that vaccines are \\u201csafe and effective.\\u201d (Related: COVID vaccine experiment causes\\u00a0<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.naturalnews.com\\/2021-10-24-covid-vaccine-experiment-causes-monstrous-spike-in-vaccine-injuries.html\\\">monstrous spike in vaccine injuries and deaths<\\/a>, serious adverse events under-reported by a factor of eight.)<\\/p>\\n<h2>Serious adverse events and fatalities are occurring at magnitudes greater than what is recorded in the VAERS system<\\/h2>\\n<p>After analyzing missing data in the VAERS system, Dr. Rose came to the conclusion that serious adverse events and fatalities following covid vaccination are much higher than what is recorded in the VAERS system. Some issues are under-reported by a factor of thirty-one, and other, more common side effects can be under-reported by a factor of one hundred.
