It is aimed disproportionately at people of color, as well as others engaged in anti-racist struggle. Whether in the fight against racism at home or against racist foreign policies, wars, occupation and colonialism, the overarching purpose of political imprisonment is to intimidate and try to crush militant forms of anti-racist struggle.</em></p>\n<p>By treating U.S. political prisoners as “common criminals,” the criminal justice system individualizes each case as if they are somehow separate from their social contexts. This ignores root causes and impedes the development of political solutions to the underlying issues for which people have been arrested.</p>\n<p>Readers can discern for themselves what is revealed in the findings presented here, and in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">US Political Prisoner list</a> this article analyzes. The large number of people of color and others involved in the anti-racist struggle arrested for their activities is sadly predictable. Our entire history and existing political and economic institutions are founded and advanced squarely on the foundations of racism.</p>\n<p>The problem is the entire U.S. social, political and economic apparatus. It’s the system that must change. Only when that happens will political prisoners find justice and true liberation in the U.S. We fight for the liberation of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal. But as wonderful as winning freedom for individuals may be, without a political solution, little is accomplished regarding the causes for which these prisoners have sacrificed their freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=432,288&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?w=432&ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"A poster with a group of people\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence\" width=\"524\" height=\"349\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"432,288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-political-prisoners-in-usa\">syracuseculturalworkers.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Not all U.S. political prisoners are in jail for explicitly anti-racist struggles. There are those in prison for opposing the whole fabric of militarism and war, women who have defended their bodies from abuse, striking blows against patriarchy, and eco-defenders.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the racism that permeates U.S. political imprisonment does not diminish the validity of the struggles for which they were arrested. Without exception, racism and anti-racism is a factor in every facet of U.S. popular movements. For instance, all anti-war and anti-imperialist struggle has a fundamentally anti-racist aspect. The one existing imperial power in the world today is the U.S./NATO Empire, an Empire centered among mostly White nations, in service to global capitalism and western geopolitical hegemony. That Empire is the primary global purveyor of the exploitation and dispossession of Black, Indigenous, and other colonized peoples in the nations of the Global South.</p>\n<p>We further recognize that we can and must look to anti-racist struggles, especially Black and Indigenous liberation, for guidance, lessons, and leadership, regardless the area of activity. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/racism-liberation-and-us-political-prisoners\">Alliance for Global Justice analysis published August 5, 2020</a> (which this paper updates), explains that,</p>\n<p>“…We are convinced that African people, including the African diaspora, play a leading role in all revolutionary and transformational struggles. African and Indigenous peoples have been specially targeted for repression and exploitation from the very beginning days of the global spread of capitalism. Today, in the U.S., the movement for the rights and self-determination of Black people has, above all else, shown that it is not a temporary struggle but that it has staying power.</p>\n<p>There is a thread that connects the struggles of the very first enslaved people through the historic Civil Rights Movement to the… Black Lives Matter uprisings today. The struggle for Black liberation in the U.S. is huge, mature yet young: multigenerational, experienced, politically savvy, and enduring. The successes of Black liberation struggles have always, in every instance, opened the way for other struggles. The struggles against slavery and for Black voting rights led directly to the women’s suffrage movement. The Civil Rights Movement was a foundation for an endless list of struggles, including anti-war, anti-poverty, women’s rights, Latin American and Asian liberation movements, disability rights, gay rights, and more. (Indigenous defense of the land and its people is, of course, the oldest movement in resistance to Empire in the Americas.) Thus, we can say that the prominence of African heritage political prisoners in the U.S. is a situation that concerns all of us.”</p>\n<p>AFGJ has maintained a list of U.S. Political Prisoners since 2013, when Stan Smith of the Chicago Committee to Free the [Cuban] Five put that list together for the first time, counting 38 U.S. Political Prisoners. Due to a lack of capacity at the time, we did not undertake an update again until 2018, when we were able to hire Nasim Chatha to help us organize a new comprehensive and updated list. Nasim had been our intern in 2012 and had written some of our pioneering work on the related theme of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/prison-imperialism\">Prison Imperialism</a>. (Prison Imperialism focuses on the export of the US mass incarceration model to other countries.)</p>\n<p>Ours is not the only political prisoner list, and we have always consulted the work of others while augmenting those with our research. We have especially relied heavily on the advice and feedback of Claude Marks from the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freedomarchives.org/\">Freedom Archives</a> and have regularly referenced the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">Jericho Movement</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nukeresister.org/\">Nuclear Resister</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://earthfirstjournal.news/\">Earth First!,</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.abcf.net/\">Anarchist Black Cross</a>.</p>\n<p>How we define who is a “political prisoner” is a classification always open to debate. We note that some organizations, such as the Jericho Movement, do not list people as political prisoners unless they have asked or agreed to be so listed. As we noted in our 2020 report,</p>\n<p>“There is a concern that prisoners may experience further targeting and harassment as a result of attention brought by well-meaning supporters. We very much respect that. For our purpose, we are trying to build a comprehensive list that reflects the overall extent and reality of politically motivated arrests in the United States. We are not involved in direct advocacy. For political prisoners who have specific solidarity campaigns, we have tried to provide links. If there are no advocacy organizations linked, they may not exist or be wanted.”</p>\n<p>We are not attempting to maintain a complete list of all U.S. political prisoners. Instead, our list is of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">U.S. political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire</a> (PP/POEs). There are, for instance, animal rights activists whom we do not include. A person arrested for direct action against the inhumane conditions suffered under the conditions of factory farming, or to liberate animals from pens where there is no freedom of movement, is not included, unless there is some element directly related to the struggle against the underpinnings of Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696,538&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?w=792&ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=768%2C593&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=150%2C116&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696%2C538&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Home | Jericho Movement\" width=\"516\" height=\"399\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/home-or-jericho-movement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=792%2C612&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,612\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"home-or-jericho-movement\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=300%2C232&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=696%2C538&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">thejerichomovement.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Even under socialism, under nations in resistance to Empire, sometimes even under locally autonomous communities, there are animals kept and exploited under conditions that can only be described as cruel. But one cannot simply blame Empire for this, even when and if it exacerbates the problem.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we define political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire? Our August 5, 2020 report on political prisoners states:</p>\n<p>“Our definition of political prisoners refers to people who are incarcerated for alleged crimes related to resistance and liberation from repression. We believe that these cases should not be treated as isolated, ‘common’ crimes, but [cases that] require a political solution. In many cases, those in jail are there because of false allegations or because they were framed and railroaded through the courts. Our list is not only of political prisoners, but also of what we term “prisoners of Empire.” By that, we mean people who are jailed because of activities that constitute a direct challenge to the national and international dominance of U.S., NATO, and transnational capitalist imperialism.”</p>\n<p>We also note in our listing that,</p>\n<p>“…political prisoners […] require a political solution […] Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply ‘common crimes.’ Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute an endorsement of the tactics or immediate goals of every individual. We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so can be, itself, a crime against the people. In many cases, those arrested have been set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights. More often than not, they have received harsher sentences than usual because of the political nature of their activities.”</p>\n<p>Although the origins of our PP/POEs list date back to 2013, this is only the second comprehensive analysis we’ve published. The first analysis was in response to the 2020 uprising sparked by the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd. We admit that what we have could be significantly augmented.</p>\n<p>We need another major and exhaustive review of the definitions, criteria, and categories we employ. Towards that end, we’ve established a committee that will spend the next year revising all aspects of the list. This is an ongoing process, and if you have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to send your suggestions to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"6d270c00081e2d2c2b2a2743021f0a43\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p>One must also look at the back stories behind the numbers and trends. For instance, in 2018, we listed 50 political prisoners. After several minor revisions in the interim, in which the total was steady, we published a major update in August of 2020, following the peak of the 2020 uprising. We found that after the 2020 uprising, the number of PPs/POE had risen by 12.28% to 57.</p>\n<p>As of the present moment, the number has diminished to a count of 55 U.S. PP/POEs, as of August 10, 2022. The decline in the overall number can be attributed to paroles, completed sentences, as well as deaths, of several PP/POEs. Especially, over the past two years, several Black PP/POEs arrested in crackdowns during the previous century have died in prison or been released after decades behind bars. These include the MOVE 9 and participants in historic Black liberation struggles, both armed and unarmed.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we found 38.60% of PPs/POE were Black, and just over 72% were people of color. Today, the percentage of Black PP/POEs has dropped to 34.55% (19), while the overall number of people of color who are PPs/POE has dropped to 69% (38). Of the other PP/POEs who are people of color, 10.9% (6) are Latino; 5.45% (3) are North “American” Indigenous; 3.64% (2) are Asian-American (non-Arab, Middle Eastern, or Central Asian); and 16.36% (9) are Arab, Middle Eastern, African Muslim, or Central Asian (one PP/POE is of Pakistani heritage, and one PP/POE is included under both Latino and Arab, ME, etc.-heritage categories).</p>\n<p>As for the last category, we have included these together because we’ve found it difficult to find statistics related to these specific ethnic groups. Instead, we find the closest readily available statistics have to do with Muslims in prison—and Muslim is not an ethnicity and can include people from all over the world, including those who are not necessarily people of color.</p>\n<p>Although Muslim or perceived-as-Muslim peoples are not ethnicities, they are discriminated against as if they were, targeted as a class because of their actual or perceived religious identification. Similarly, prison population statistics regularly confuse the count of Latino prisoners by counting most of them simply as “white.”</p>\n<p>To understand the racism revealed in these percentages, we must compare them to the demographic percentages of the US population as a whole. Respectively, we find that the U.S. general population is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/VET605220#VET605220\">13.6% Black, 18.9% Latino, 1.3% Indigenous</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/\">1.1% “Muslim.”</a></p>\n<p>The racist application of the “criminal justice” system is a feature of the entire system, not just of political imprisonment, which itself reflects a larger reality. For instance, we find that Black persons are incarcerated at a rate <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/jail-inmates-2020-statistical-tables\">3.5 times higher than that of Whites</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696,357&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?w=779&ssl=1 779w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=300%2C154&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=768%2C394&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=150%2C77&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696%2C357&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Progression from slavery to mass incarceration in US history\" width=\"612\" height=\"314\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=779%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"779,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=300%2C154&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=696%2C357&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2019/08/slavery-to-mass-incarceration\">benjerry.com</a></span></p>\n<p>We need to place the differences and the total number of PP/POEs within context. Among the U.S. PP/POEs, it is significant that just over 14.55% (8) of the total are those incarcerated for their activities during the 2020 Uprising. There are also still two PP/POEs that remain in jail for activities related to the Ferguson uprising in 2014, following the extrajudicial killing of Michael Brown. If we add those together, we find that 18.18% of U.S. PPs/POE have been jailed in relation to charges stemming from the birth and continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>How do we determine who and how many are PPs/POE because of anti-racist struggle? We count 22 of 55 PPs/POE, or 40%, arrested for domestic anti-racist actions. As an international solidarity organization, AFGJ is keenly aware that U.S. foreign policies and international relations are extensions of the same policies, attitudes, and actions that drive domestic racism. U.S. wars, sanctions, blockades, and Prison Imperialism are overwhelmingly wielded against nations with a large majority of people of color, countries of the Global South. We find that 11 PPs/POE are in jail for actions of international solidarity with specific nations targeted by Empire (as Noam Chomsky defines it, “an integrated policy of U.S. military and economic supremacy”).</p>\n<p>Another 8 are people involved in activities of self-determination, liberation, and defense of their territories from occupation, war, sanctions, and blockades.</p>\n<p>Among them are Simon Trinidad from Colombia, Ivan Vargas from Colombia, Alex Saab from Venezuela, the Virgin Island Three, Mun Chol, Myong, and Leonard Peltier (in defense of the Lakota nation in occupied South Dakota). Together, these represent 34.55% (19) of those engaged in struggle directly against the international application of U.S. racist and political repression. When we combine those arrested for domestic and international resistance to U.S. racism, we find that 42 of 55 PPs/POE, 76.36%, are incarcerated for acts of anti-racist resistance.</p>\n<p>In other words, more than three quarters of US/POEs are in jail for activities that can be described as anti-racist.</p>\n<p>We also count 5.54% (three) PP/POEs jailed for eco-defense. 7.27% (four) were arrested for activities generally or directly opposed to U.S. militarism and wars. 7.27% (the Cleveland Four) are in prison for generalized resistance to the U.S. political system and global capitalism. 3.64% (two) women are in jail for defending themselves from their abusers or rapists.</p>\n<p>As for the last category, the reality is that there are hundreds if not thousands we might include in that category. We need to pose several questions and investigations to determine who and how many of these there are and who, if not all, could be considered Prisoners of Empire. We ask the reader to be patient with us as we delve into this complex and challenging area of research for next year’s report.</p>\n<p>For now, we include Maddesyn George and Fran Thompson as emblematic cases for which we know there is a much higher total.</p>\n<p>We also note that there is overlap in some of these categories. For instance, Fran Thompson is included as a woman arrested for self-defense and an eco-defender, exacerbating her prosecution and sentencing. There are other cases where people are counted in more than one category.</p>\n<p>At the 2013 Tear Down the Walls conference in Tucson, Arizona, Margaret Prescod of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women’s Strike</a> argued that all those interned under the inherently racist and classist U.S. model of mass incarceration are political prisoners. That may not be our definition, but who can honestly claim she was wrong?</p>\n<p>In our list of classes of political imprisonment, we include those held in immigrant detention centers and those still held in occupied Cuba at the Guantánamo prison. But they are not counted among the 55 PPs/POE that we document.</p>\n<p>We do know this—even if we added the 36 inmates in Guantánamo, the thousands held in immigrant detention centers, the many women jailed for defending themselves against their rapists and abusers, and, therefore, in resistance to the patriarchal underpinnings of the Empire, these inclusions would only underscore what we already know: political imprisonment in the U.S. is a tool of racist as well as other easily identified forms of repression both at home and abroad, and all of these cases require political solutions, not individualized and decontextualized punishment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, systemic change is needed, which is another way of saying revolution.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

It is aimed disproportionately at people of color, as well as others engaged in anti-racist struggle. Whether in the fight against racism at home or against racist foreign policies, wars, occupation and colonialism, the overarching purpose of political imprisonment is to intimidate and try to crush militant forms of anti-racist struggle.</em></p>\n<p>By treating U.S. political prisoners as “common criminals,” the criminal justice system individualizes each case as if they are somehow separate from their social contexts. This ignores root causes and impedes the development of political solutions to the underlying issues for which people have been arrested.</p>\n<p>Readers can discern for themselves what is revealed in the findings presented here, and in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">US Political Prisoner list</a> this article analyzes. The large number of people of color and others involved in the anti-racist struggle arrested for their activities is sadly predictable. Our entire history and existing political and economic institutions are founded and advanced squarely on the foundations of racism.</p>\n<p>The problem is the entire U.S. social, political and economic apparatus. It’s the system that must change. Only when that happens will political prisoners find justice and true liberation in the U.S. We fight for the liberation of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal. But as wonderful as winning freedom for individuals may be, without a political solution, little is accomplished regarding the causes for which these prisoners have sacrificed their freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=432,288&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?w=432&ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"A poster with a group of people\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence\" width=\"524\" height=\"349\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"432,288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-political-prisoners-in-usa\">syracuseculturalworkers.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Not all U.S. political prisoners are in jail for explicitly anti-racist struggles. There are those in prison for opposing the whole fabric of militarism and war, women who have defended their bodies from abuse, striking blows against patriarchy, and eco-defenders.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the racism that permeates U.S. political imprisonment does not diminish the validity of the struggles for which they were arrested. Without exception, racism and anti-racism is a factor in every facet of U.S. popular movements. For instance, all anti-war and anti-imperialist struggle has a fundamentally anti-racist aspect. The one existing imperial power in the world today is the U.S./NATO Empire, an Empire centered among mostly White nations, in service to global capitalism and western geopolitical hegemony. That Empire is the primary global purveyor of the exploitation and dispossession of Black, Indigenous, and other colonized peoples in the nations of the Global South.</p>\n<p>We further recognize that we can and must look to anti-racist struggles, especially Black and Indigenous liberation, for guidance, lessons, and leadership, regardless the area of activity. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/racism-liberation-and-us-political-prisoners\">Alliance for Global Justice analysis published August 5, 2020</a> (which this paper updates), explains that,</p>\n<p>“…We are convinced that African people, including the African diaspora, play a leading role in all revolutionary and transformational struggles. African and Indigenous peoples have been specially targeted for repression and exploitation from the very beginning days of the global spread of capitalism. Today, in the U.S., the movement for the rights and self-determination of Black people has, above all else, shown that it is not a temporary struggle but that it has staying power.</p>\n<p>There is a thread that connects the struggles of the very first enslaved people through the historic Civil Rights Movement to the… Black Lives Matter uprisings today. The struggle for Black liberation in the U.S. is huge, mature yet young: multigenerational, experienced, politically savvy, and enduring. The successes of Black liberation struggles have always, in every instance, opened the way for other struggles. The struggles against slavery and for Black voting rights led directly to the women’s suffrage movement. The Civil Rights Movement was a foundation for an endless list of struggles, including anti-war, anti-poverty, women’s rights, Latin American and Asian liberation movements, disability rights, gay rights, and more. (Indigenous defense of the land and its people is, of course, the oldest movement in resistance to Empire in the Americas.) Thus, we can say that the prominence of African heritage political prisoners in the U.S. is a situation that concerns all of us.”</p>\n<p>AFGJ has maintained a list of U.S. Political Prisoners since 2013, when Stan Smith of the Chicago Committee to Free the [Cuban] Five put that list together for the first time, counting 38 U.S. Political Prisoners. Due to a lack of capacity at the time, we did not undertake an update again until 2018, when we were able to hire Nasim Chatha to help us organize a new comprehensive and updated list. Nasim had been our intern in 2012 and had written some of our pioneering work on the related theme of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/prison-imperialism\">Prison Imperialism</a>. (Prison Imperialism focuses on the export of the US mass incarceration model to other countries.)</p>\n<p>Ours is not the only political prisoner list, and we have always consulted the work of others while augmenting those with our research. We have especially relied heavily on the advice and feedback of Claude Marks from the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freedomarchives.org/\">Freedom Archives</a> and have regularly referenced the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">Jericho Movement</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nukeresister.org/\">Nuclear Resister</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://earthfirstjournal.news/\">Earth First!,</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.abcf.net/\">Anarchist Black Cross</a>.</p>\n<p>How we define who is a “political prisoner” is a classification always open to debate. We note that some organizations, such as the Jericho Movement, do not list people as political prisoners unless they have asked or agreed to be so listed. As we noted in our 2020 report,</p>\n<p>“There is a concern that prisoners may experience further targeting and harassment as a result of attention brought by well-meaning supporters. We very much respect that. For our purpose, we are trying to build a comprehensive list that reflects the overall extent and reality of politically motivated arrests in the United States. We are not involved in direct advocacy. For political prisoners who have specific solidarity campaigns, we have tried to provide links. If there are no advocacy organizations linked, they may not exist or be wanted.”</p>\n<p>We are not attempting to maintain a complete list of all U.S. political prisoners. Instead, our list is of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">U.S. political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire</a> (PP/POEs). There are, for instance, animal rights activists whom we do not include. A person arrested for direct action against the inhumane conditions suffered under the conditions of factory farming, or to liberate animals from pens where there is no freedom of movement, is not included, unless there is some element directly related to the struggle against the underpinnings of Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696,538&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?w=792&ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=768%2C593&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=150%2C116&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696%2C538&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Home | Jericho Movement\" width=\"516\" height=\"399\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/home-or-jericho-movement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=792%2C612&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,612\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"home-or-jericho-movement\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=300%2C232&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=696%2C538&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">thejerichomovement.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Even under socialism, under nations in resistance to Empire, sometimes even under locally autonomous communities, there are animals kept and exploited under conditions that can only be described as cruel. But one cannot simply blame Empire for this, even when and if it exacerbates the problem.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we define political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire? Our August 5, 2020 report on political prisoners states:</p>\n<p>“Our definition of political prisoners refers to people who are incarcerated for alleged crimes related to resistance and liberation from repression. We believe that these cases should not be treated as isolated, ‘common’ crimes, but [cases that] require a political solution. In many cases, those in jail are there because of false allegations or because they were framed and railroaded through the courts. Our list is not only of political prisoners, but also of what we term “prisoners of Empire.” By that, we mean people who are jailed because of activities that constitute a direct challenge to the national and international dominance of U.S., NATO, and transnational capitalist imperialism.”</p>\n<p>We also note in our listing that,</p>\n<p>“…political prisoners […] require a political solution […] Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply ‘common crimes.’ Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute an endorsement of the tactics or immediate goals of every individual. We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so can be, itself, a crime against the people. In many cases, those arrested have been set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights. More often than not, they have received harsher sentences than usual because of the political nature of their activities.”</p>\n<p>Although the origins of our PP/POEs list date back to 2013, this is only the second comprehensive analysis we’ve published. The first analysis was in response to the 2020 uprising sparked by the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd. We admit that what we have could be significantly augmented.</p>\n<p>We need another major and exhaustive review of the definitions, criteria, and categories we employ. Towards that end, we’ve established a committee that will spend the next year revising all aspects of the list. This is an ongoing process, and if you have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to send your suggestions to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"2e644f434b5d6e6f68696400415c4900\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p>One must also look at the back stories behind the numbers and trends. For instance, in 2018, we listed 50 political prisoners. After several minor revisions in the interim, in which the total was steady, we published a major update in August of 2020, following the peak of the 2020 uprising. We found that after the 2020 uprising, the number of PPs/POE had risen by 12.28% to 57.</p>\n<p>As of the present moment, the number has diminished to a count of 55 U.S. PP/POEs, as of August 10, 2022. The decline in the overall number can be attributed to paroles, completed sentences, as well as deaths, of several PP/POEs. Especially, over the past two years, several Black PP/POEs arrested in crackdowns during the previous century have died in prison or been released after decades behind bars. These include the MOVE 9 and participants in historic Black liberation struggles, both armed and unarmed.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we found 38.60% of PPs/POE were Black, and just over 72% were people of color. Today, the percentage of Black PP/POEs has dropped to 34.55% (19), while the overall number of people of color who are PPs/POE has dropped to 69% (38). Of the other PP/POEs who are people of color, 10.9% (6) are Latino; 5.45% (3) are North “American” Indigenous; 3.64% (2) are Asian-American (non-Arab, Middle Eastern, or Central Asian); and 16.36% (9) are Arab, Middle Eastern, African Muslim, or Central Asian (one PP/POE is of Pakistani heritage, and one PP/POE is included under both Latino and Arab, ME, etc.-heritage categories).</p>\n<p>As for the last category, we have included these together because we’ve found it difficult to find statistics related to these specific ethnic groups. Instead, we find the closest readily available statistics have to do with Muslims in prison—and Muslim is not an ethnicity and can include people from all over the world, including those who are not necessarily people of color.</p>\n<p>Although Muslim or perceived-as-Muslim peoples are not ethnicities, they are discriminated against as if they were, targeted as a class because of their actual or perceived religious identification. Similarly, prison population statistics regularly confuse the count of Latino prisoners by counting most of them simply as “white.”</p>\n<p>To understand the racism revealed in these percentages, we must compare them to the demographic percentages of the US population as a whole. Respectively, we find that the U.S. general population is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/VET605220#VET605220\">13.6% Black, 18.9% Latino, 1.3% Indigenous</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/\">1.1% “Muslim.”</a></p>\n<p>The racist application of the “criminal justice” system is a feature of the entire system, not just of political imprisonment, which itself reflects a larger reality. For instance, we find that Black persons are incarcerated at a rate <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/jail-inmates-2020-statistical-tables\">3.5 times higher than that of Whites</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696,357&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?w=779&ssl=1 779w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=300%2C154&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=768%2C394&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=150%2C77&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696%2C357&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Progression from slavery to mass incarceration in US history\" width=\"612\" height=\"314\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=779%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"779,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=300%2C154&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=696%2C357&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2019/08/slavery-to-mass-incarceration\">benjerry.com</a></span></p>\n<p>We need to place the differences and the total number of PP/POEs within context. Among the U.S. PP/POEs, it is significant that just over 14.55% (8) of the total are those incarcerated for their activities during the 2020 Uprising. There are also still two PP/POEs that remain in jail for activities related to the Ferguson uprising in 2014, following the extrajudicial killing of Michael Brown. If we add those together, we find that 18.18% of U.S. PPs/POE have been jailed in relation to charges stemming from the birth and continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>How do we determine who and how many are PPs/POE because of anti-racist struggle? We count 22 of 55 PPs/POE, or 40%, arrested for domestic anti-racist actions. As an international solidarity organization, AFGJ is keenly aware that U.S. foreign policies and international relations are extensions of the same policies, attitudes, and actions that drive domestic racism. U.S. wars, sanctions, blockades, and Prison Imperialism are overwhelmingly wielded against nations with a large majority of people of color, countries of the Global South. We find that 11 PPs/POE are in jail for actions of international solidarity with specific nations targeted by Empire (as Noam Chomsky defines it, “an integrated policy of U.S. military and economic supremacy”).</p>\n<p>Another 8 are people involved in activities of self-determination, liberation, and defense of their territories from occupation, war, sanctions, and blockades.</p>\n<p>Among them are Simon Trinidad from Colombia, Ivan Vargas from Colombia, Alex Saab from Venezuela, the Virgin Island Three, Mun Chol, Myong, and Leonard Peltier (in defense of the Lakota nation in occupied South Dakota). Together, these represent 34.55% (19) of those engaged in struggle directly against the international application of U.S. racist and political repression. When we combine those arrested for domestic and international resistance to U.S. racism, we find that 42 of 55 PPs/POE, 76.36%, are incarcerated for acts of anti-racist resistance.</p>\n<p>In other words, more than three quarters of US/POEs are in jail for activities that can be described as anti-racist.</p>\n<p>We also count 5.54% (three) PP/POEs jailed for eco-defense. 7.27% (four) were arrested for activities generally or directly opposed to U.S. militarism and wars. 7.27% (the Cleveland Four) are in prison for generalized resistance to the U.S. political system and global capitalism. 3.64% (two) women are in jail for defending themselves from their abusers or rapists.</p>\n<p>As for the last category, the reality is that there are hundreds if not thousands we might include in that category. We need to pose several questions and investigations to determine who and how many of these there are and who, if not all, could be considered Prisoners of Empire. We ask the reader to be patient with us as we delve into this complex and challenging area of research for next year’s report.</p>\n<p>For now, we include Maddesyn George and Fran Thompson as emblematic cases for which we know there is a much higher total.</p>\n<p>We also note that there is overlap in some of these categories. For instance, Fran Thompson is included as a woman arrested for self-defense and an eco-defender, exacerbating her prosecution and sentencing. There are other cases where people are counted in more than one category.</p>\n<p>At the 2013 Tear Down the Walls conference in Tucson, Arizona, Margaret Prescod of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women’s Strike</a> argued that all those interned under the inherently racist and classist U.S. model of mass incarceration are political prisoners. That may not be our definition, but who can honestly claim she was wrong?</p>\n<p>In our list of classes of political imprisonment, we include those held in immigrant detention centers and those still held in occupied Cuba at the Guantánamo prison. But they are not counted among the 55 PPs/POE that we document.</p>\n<p>We do know this—even if we added the 36 inmates in Guantánamo, the thousands held in immigrant detention centers, the many women jailed for defending themselves against their rapists and abusers, and, therefore, in resistance to the patriarchal underpinnings of the Empire, these inclusions would only underscore what we already know: political imprisonment in the U.S. is a tool of racist as well as other easily identified forms of repression both at home and abroad, and all of these cases require political solutions, not individualized and decontextualized punishment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, systemic change is needed, which is another way of saying revolution.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

It is aimed disproportionately at people of color, as well as others engaged in anti-racist struggle. Whether in the fight against racism at home or against racist foreign policies, wars, occupation and colonialism, the overarching purpose of political imprisonment is to intimidate and try to crush militant forms of anti-racist struggle.</em></p>\n<p>By treating U.S. political prisoners as “common criminals,” the criminal justice system individualizes each case as if they are somehow separate from their social contexts. This ignores root causes and impedes the development of political solutions to the underlying issues for which people have been arrested.</p>\n<p>Readers can discern for themselves what is revealed in the findings presented here, and in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">US Political Prisoner list</a> this article analyzes. The large number of people of color and others involved in the anti-racist struggle arrested for their activities is sadly predictable. Our entire history and existing political and economic institutions are founded and advanced squarely on the foundations of racism.</p>\n<p>The problem is the entire U.S. social, political and economic apparatus. It’s the system that must change. Only when that happens will political prisoners find justice and true liberation in the U.S. We fight for the liberation of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal. But as wonderful as winning freedom for individuals may be, without a political solution, little is accomplished regarding the causes for which these prisoners have sacrificed their freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=432,288&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?w=432&ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"A poster with a group of people\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence\" width=\"524\" height=\"349\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"432,288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-political-prisoners-in-usa\">syracuseculturalworkers.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Not all U.S. political prisoners are in jail for explicitly anti-racist struggles. There are those in prison for opposing the whole fabric of militarism and war, women who have defended their bodies from abuse, striking blows against patriarchy, and eco-defenders.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the racism that permeates U.S. political imprisonment does not diminish the validity of the struggles for which they were arrested. Without exception, racism and anti-racism is a factor in every facet of U.S. popular movements. For instance, all anti-war and anti-imperialist struggle has a fundamentally anti-racist aspect. The one existing imperial power in the world today is the U.S./NATO Empire, an Empire centered among mostly White nations, in service to global capitalism and western geopolitical hegemony. That Empire is the primary global purveyor of the exploitation and dispossession of Black, Indigenous, and other colonized peoples in the nations of the Global South.</p>\n<p>We further recognize that we can and must look to anti-racist struggles, especially Black and Indigenous liberation, for guidance, lessons, and leadership, regardless the area of activity. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/racism-liberation-and-us-political-prisoners\">Alliance for Global Justice analysis published August 5, 2020</a> (which this paper updates), explains that,</p>\n<p>“…We are convinced that African people, including the African diaspora, play a leading role in all revolutionary and transformational struggles. African and Indigenous peoples have been specially targeted for repression and exploitation from the very beginning days of the global spread of capitalism. Today, in the U.S., the movement for the rights and self-determination of Black people has, above all else, shown that it is not a temporary struggle but that it has staying power.</p>\n<p>There is a thread that connects the struggles of the very first enslaved people through the historic Civil Rights Movement to the… Black Lives Matter uprisings today. The struggle for Black liberation in the U.S. is huge, mature yet young: multigenerational, experienced, politically savvy, and enduring. The successes of Black liberation struggles have always, in every instance, opened the way for other struggles. The struggles against slavery and for Black voting rights led directly to the women’s suffrage movement. The Civil Rights Movement was a foundation for an endless list of struggles, including anti-war, anti-poverty, women’s rights, Latin American and Asian liberation movements, disability rights, gay rights, and more. (Indigenous defense of the land and its people is, of course, the oldest movement in resistance to Empire in the Americas.) Thus, we can say that the prominence of African heritage political prisoners in the U.S. is a situation that concerns all of us.”</p>\n<p>AFGJ has maintained a list of U.S. Political Prisoners since 2013, when Stan Smith of the Chicago Committee to Free the [Cuban] Five put that list together for the first time, counting 38 U.S. Political Prisoners. Due to a lack of capacity at the time, we did not undertake an update again until 2018, when we were able to hire Nasim Chatha to help us organize a new comprehensive and updated list. Nasim had been our intern in 2012 and had written some of our pioneering work on the related theme of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/prison-imperialism\">Prison Imperialism</a>. (Prison Imperialism focuses on the export of the US mass incarceration model to other countries.)</p>\n<p>Ours is not the only political prisoner list, and we have always consulted the work of others while augmenting those with our research. We have especially relied heavily on the advice and feedback of Claude Marks from the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freedomarchives.org/\">Freedom Archives</a> and have regularly referenced the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">Jericho Movement</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nukeresister.org/\">Nuclear Resister</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://earthfirstjournal.news/\">Earth First!,</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.abcf.net/\">Anarchist Black Cross</a>.</p>\n<p>How we define who is a “political prisoner” is a classification always open to debate. We note that some organizations, such as the Jericho Movement, do not list people as political prisoners unless they have asked or agreed to be so listed. As we noted in our 2020 report,</p>\n<p>“There is a concern that prisoners may experience further targeting and harassment as a result of attention brought by well-meaning supporters. We very much respect that. For our purpose, we are trying to build a comprehensive list that reflects the overall extent and reality of politically motivated arrests in the United States. We are not involved in direct advocacy. For political prisoners who have specific solidarity campaigns, we have tried to provide links. If there are no advocacy organizations linked, they may not exist or be wanted.”</p>\n<p>We are not attempting to maintain a complete list of all U.S. political prisoners. Instead, our list is of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">U.S. political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire</a> (PP/POEs). There are, for instance, animal rights activists whom we do not include. A person arrested for direct action against the inhumane conditions suffered under the conditions of factory farming, or to liberate animals from pens where there is no freedom of movement, is not included, unless there is some element directly related to the struggle against the underpinnings of Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696,538&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?w=792&ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=768%2C593&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=150%2C116&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696%2C538&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Home | Jericho Movement\" width=\"516\" height=\"399\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/home-or-jericho-movement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=792%2C612&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,612\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"home-or-jericho-movement\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=300%2C232&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=696%2C538&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">thejerichomovement.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Even under socialism, under nations in resistance to Empire, sometimes even under locally autonomous communities, there are animals kept and exploited under conditions that can only be described as cruel. But one cannot simply blame Empire for this, even when and if it exacerbates the problem.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we define political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire? Our August 5, 2020 report on political prisoners states:</p>\n<p>“Our definition of political prisoners refers to people who are incarcerated for alleged crimes related to resistance and liberation from repression. We believe that these cases should not be treated as isolated, ‘common’ crimes, but [cases that] require a political solution. In many cases, those in jail are there because of false allegations or because they were framed and railroaded through the courts. Our list is not only of political prisoners, but also of what we term “prisoners of Empire.” By that, we mean people who are jailed because of activities that constitute a direct challenge to the national and international dominance of U.S., NATO, and transnational capitalist imperialism.”</p>\n<p>We also note in our listing that,</p>\n<p>“…political prisoners […] require a political solution […] Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply ‘common crimes.’ Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute an endorsement of the tactics or immediate goals of every individual. We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so can be, itself, a crime against the people. In many cases, those arrested have been set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights. More often than not, they have received harsher sentences than usual because of the political nature of their activities.”</p>\n<p>Although the origins of our PP/POEs list date back to 2013, this is only the second comprehensive analysis we’ve published. The first analysis was in response to the 2020 uprising sparked by the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd. We admit that what we have could be significantly augmented.</p>\n<p>We need another major and exhaustive review of the definitions, criteria, and categories we employ. Towards that end, we’ve established a committee that will spend the next year revising all aspects of the list. This is an ongoing process, and if you have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to send your suggestions to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"276d464a4254676661606d0948554009\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p>One must also look at the back stories behind the numbers and trends. For instance, in 2018, we listed 50 political prisoners. After several minor revisions in the interim, in which the total was steady, we published a major update in August of 2020, following the peak of the 2020 uprising. We found that after the 2020 uprising, the number of PPs/POE had risen by 12.28% to 57.</p>\n<p>As of the present moment, the number has diminished to a count of 55 U.S. PP/POEs, as of August 10, 2022. The decline in the overall number can be attributed to paroles, completed sentences, as well as deaths, of several PP/POEs. Especially, over the past two years, several Black PP/POEs arrested in crackdowns during the previous century have died in prison or been released after decades behind bars. These include the MOVE 9 and participants in historic Black liberation struggles, both armed and unarmed.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we found 38.60% of PPs/POE were Black, and just over 72% were people of color. Today, the percentage of Black PP/POEs has dropped to 34.55% (19), while the overall number of people of color who are PPs/POE has dropped to 69% (38). Of the other PP/POEs who are people of color, 10.9% (6) are Latino; 5.45% (3) are North “American” Indigenous; 3.64% (2) are Asian-American (non-Arab, Middle Eastern, or Central Asian); and 16.36% (9) are Arab, Middle Eastern, African Muslim, or Central Asian (one PP/POE is of Pakistani heritage, and one PP/POE is included under both Latino and Arab, ME, etc.-heritage categories).</p>\n<p>As for the last category, we have included these together because we’ve found it difficult to find statistics related to these specific ethnic groups. Instead, we find the closest readily available statistics have to do with Muslims in prison—and Muslim is not an ethnicity and can include people from all over the world, including those who are not necessarily people of color.</p>\n<p>Although Muslim or perceived-as-Muslim peoples are not ethnicities, they are discriminated against as if they were, targeted as a class because of their actual or perceived religious identification. Similarly, prison population statistics regularly confuse the count of Latino prisoners by counting most of them simply as “white.”</p>\n<p>To understand the racism revealed in these percentages, we must compare them to the demographic percentages of the US population as a whole. Respectively, we find that the U.S. general population is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/VET605220#VET605220\">13.6% Black, 18.9% Latino, 1.3% Indigenous</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/\">1.1% “Muslim.”</a></p>\n<p>The racist application of the “criminal justice” system is a feature of the entire system, not just of political imprisonment, which itself reflects a larger reality. For instance, we find that Black persons are incarcerated at a rate <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/jail-inmates-2020-statistical-tables\">3.5 times higher than that of Whites</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696,357&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?w=779&ssl=1 779w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=300%2C154&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=768%2C394&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=150%2C77&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696%2C357&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Progression from slavery to mass incarceration in US history\" width=\"612\" height=\"314\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=779%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"779,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=300%2C154&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=696%2C357&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2019/08/slavery-to-mass-incarceration\">benjerry.com</a></span></p>\n<p>We need to place the differences and the total number of PP/POEs within context. Among the U.S. PP/POEs, it is significant that just over 14.55% (8) of the total are those incarcerated for their activities during the 2020 Uprising. There are also still two PP/POEs that remain in jail for activities related to the Ferguson uprising in 2014, following the extrajudicial killing of Michael Brown. If we add those together, we find that 18.18% of U.S. PPs/POE have been jailed in relation to charges stemming from the birth and continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>How do we determine who and how many are PPs/POE because of anti-racist struggle? We count 22 of 55 PPs/POE, or 40%, arrested for domestic anti-racist actions. As an international solidarity organization, AFGJ is keenly aware that U.S. foreign policies and international relations are extensions of the same policies, attitudes, and actions that drive domestic racism. U.S. wars, sanctions, blockades, and Prison Imperialism are overwhelmingly wielded against nations with a large majority of people of color, countries of the Global South. We find that 11 PPs/POE are in jail for actions of international solidarity with specific nations targeted by Empire (as Noam Chomsky defines it, “an integrated policy of U.S. military and economic supremacy”).</p>\n<p>Another 8 are people involved in activities of self-determination, liberation, and defense of their territories from occupation, war, sanctions, and blockades.</p>\n<p>Among them are Simon Trinidad from Colombia, Ivan Vargas from Colombia, Alex Saab from Venezuela, the Virgin Island Three, Mun Chol, Myong, and Leonard Peltier (in defense of the Lakota nation in occupied South Dakota). Together, these represent 34.55% (19) of those engaged in struggle directly against the international application of U.S. racist and political repression. When we combine those arrested for domestic and international resistance to U.S. racism, we find that 42 of 55 PPs/POE, 76.36%, are incarcerated for acts of anti-racist resistance.</p>\n<p>In other words, more than three quarters of US/POEs are in jail for activities that can be described as anti-racist.</p>\n<p>We also count 5.54% (three) PP/POEs jailed for eco-defense. 7.27% (four) were arrested for activities generally or directly opposed to U.S. militarism and wars. 7.27% (the Cleveland Four) are in prison for generalized resistance to the U.S. political system and global capitalism. 3.64% (two) women are in jail for defending themselves from their abusers or rapists.</p>\n<p>As for the last category, the reality is that there are hundreds if not thousands we might include in that category. We need to pose several questions and investigations to determine who and how many of these there are and who, if not all, could be considered Prisoners of Empire. We ask the reader to be patient with us as we delve into this complex and challenging area of research for next year’s report.</p>\n<p>For now, we include Maddesyn George and Fran Thompson as emblematic cases for which we know there is a much higher total.</p>\n<p>We also note that there is overlap in some of these categories. For instance, Fran Thompson is included as a woman arrested for self-defense and an eco-defender, exacerbating her prosecution and sentencing. There are other cases where people are counted in more than one category.</p>\n<p>At the 2013 Tear Down the Walls conference in Tucson, Arizona, Margaret Prescod of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women’s Strike</a> argued that all those interned under the inherently racist and classist U.S. model of mass incarceration are political prisoners. That may not be our definition, but who can honestly claim she was wrong?</p>\n<p>In our list of classes of political imprisonment, we include those held in immigrant detention centers and those still held in occupied Cuba at the Guantánamo prison. But they are not counted among the 55 PPs/POE that we document.</p>\n<p>We do know this—even if we added the 36 inmates in Guantánamo, the thousands held in immigrant detention centers, the many women jailed for defending themselves against their rapists and abusers, and, therefore, in resistance to the patriarchal underpinnings of the Empire, these inclusions would only underscore what we already know: political imprisonment in the U.S. is a tool of racist as well as other easily identified forms of repression both at home and abroad, and all of these cases require political solutions, not individualized and decontextualized punishment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, systemic change is needed, which is another way of saying revolution.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

It is aimed disproportionately at people of color, as well as others engaged in anti-racist struggle. Whether in the fight against racism at home or against racist foreign policies, wars, occupation and colonialism, the overarching purpose of political imprisonment is to intimidate and try to crush militant forms of anti-racist struggle.</em></p>\n<p>By treating U.S. political prisoners as “common criminals,” the criminal justice system individualizes each case as if they are somehow separate from their social contexts. This ignores root causes and impedes the development of political solutions to the underlying issues for which people have been arrested.</p>\n<p>Readers can discern for themselves what is revealed in the findings presented here, and in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">US Political Prisoner list</a> this article analyzes. The large number of people of color and others involved in the anti-racist struggle arrested for their activities is sadly predictable. Our entire history and existing political and economic institutions are founded and advanced squarely on the foundations of racism.</p>\n<p>The problem is the entire U.S. social, political and economic apparatus. It’s the system that must change. Only when that happens will political prisoners find justice and true liberation in the U.S. We fight for the liberation of Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu Jamal. But as wonderful as winning freedom for individuals may be, without a political solution, little is accomplished regarding the causes for which these prisoners have sacrificed their freedom.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=432,288&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?w=432&ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"A poster with a group of people\n\nDescription automatically generated with low confidence\" width=\"524\" height=\"349\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"432,288\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=300%2C200&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-poster-with-a-group-of-people-description-autom.jpeg?fit=432%2C288&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-political-prisoners-in-usa\">syracuseculturalworkers.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Not all U.S. political prisoners are in jail for explicitly anti-racist struggles. There are those in prison for opposing the whole fabric of militarism and war, women who have defended their bodies from abuse, striking blows against patriarchy, and eco-defenders.</p>\n<p>Recognizing the racism that permeates U.S. political imprisonment does not diminish the validity of the struggles for which they were arrested. Without exception, racism and anti-racism is a factor in every facet of U.S. popular movements. For instance, all anti-war and anti-imperialist struggle has a fundamentally anti-racist aspect. The one existing imperial power in the world today is the U.S./NATO Empire, an Empire centered among mostly White nations, in service to global capitalism and western geopolitical hegemony. That Empire is the primary global purveyor of the exploitation and dispossession of Black, Indigenous, and other colonized peoples in the nations of the Global South.</p>\n<p>We further recognize that we can and must look to anti-racist struggles, especially Black and Indigenous liberation, for guidance, lessons, and leadership, regardless the area of activity. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/racism-liberation-and-us-political-prisoners\">Alliance for Global Justice analysis published August 5, 2020</a> (which this paper updates), explains that,</p>\n<p>“…We are convinced that African people, including the African diaspora, play a leading role in all revolutionary and transformational struggles. African and Indigenous peoples have been specially targeted for repression and exploitation from the very beginning days of the global spread of capitalism. Today, in the U.S., the movement for the rights and self-determination of Black people has, above all else, shown that it is not a temporary struggle but that it has staying power.</p>\n<p>There is a thread that connects the struggles of the very first enslaved people through the historic Civil Rights Movement to the… Black Lives Matter uprisings today. The struggle for Black liberation in the U.S. is huge, mature yet young: multigenerational, experienced, politically savvy, and enduring. The successes of Black liberation struggles have always, in every instance, opened the way for other struggles. The struggles against slavery and for Black voting rights led directly to the women’s suffrage movement. The Civil Rights Movement was a foundation for an endless list of struggles, including anti-war, anti-poverty, women’s rights, Latin American and Asian liberation movements, disability rights, gay rights, and more. (Indigenous defense of the land and its people is, of course, the oldest movement in resistance to Empire in the Americas.) Thus, we can say that the prominence of African heritage political prisoners in the U.S. is a situation that concerns all of us.”</p>\n<p>AFGJ has maintained a list of U.S. Political Prisoners since 2013, when Stan Smith of the Chicago Committee to Free the [Cuban] Five put that list together for the first time, counting 38 U.S. Political Prisoners. Due to a lack of capacity at the time, we did not undertake an update again until 2018, when we were able to hire Nasim Chatha to help us organize a new comprehensive and updated list. Nasim had been our intern in 2012 and had written some of our pioneering work on the related theme of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/prison-imperialism\">Prison Imperialism</a>. (Prison Imperialism focuses on the export of the US mass incarceration model to other countries.)</p>\n<p>Ours is not the only political prisoner list, and we have always consulted the work of others while augmenting those with our research. We have especially relied heavily on the advice and feedback of Claude Marks from the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freedomarchives.org/\">Freedom Archives</a> and have regularly referenced the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">Jericho Movement</a>, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nukeresister.org/\">Nuclear Resister</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://earthfirstjournal.news/\">Earth First!,</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.abcf.net/\">Anarchist Black Cross</a>.</p>\n<p>How we define who is a “political prisoner” is a classification always open to debate. We note that some organizations, such as the Jericho Movement, do not list people as political prisoners unless they have asked or agreed to be so listed. As we noted in our 2020 report,</p>\n<p>“There is a concern that prisoners may experience further targeting and harassment as a result of attention brought by well-meaning supporters. We very much respect that. For our purpose, we are trying to build a comprehensive list that reflects the overall extent and reality of politically motivated arrests in the United States. We are not involved in direct advocacy. For political prisoners who have specific solidarity campaigns, we have tried to provide links. If there are no advocacy organizations linked, they may not exist or be wanted.”</p>\n<p>We are not attempting to maintain a complete list of all U.S. political prisoners. Instead, our list is of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://afgj.org/politicalprisonersusa\">U.S. political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire</a> (PP/POEs). There are, for instance, animal rights activists whom we do not include. A person arrested for direct action against the inhumane conditions suffered under the conditions of factory farming, or to liberate animals from pens where there is no freedom of movement, is not included, unless there is some element directly related to the struggle against the underpinnings of Empire.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696,538&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?w=792&ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=300%2C232&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=768%2C593&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=150%2C116&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?resize=696%2C538&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Home | Jericho Movement\" width=\"516\" height=\"399\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/home-or-jericho-movement/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=792%2C612&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"792,612\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"home-or-jericho-movement\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=300%2C232&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/home-or-jericho-movement.jpeg?fit=696%2C538&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thejerichomovement.com/\">thejerichomovement.com</a></span></p>\n<p>Even under socialism, under nations in resistance to Empire, sometimes even under locally autonomous communities, there are animals kept and exploited under conditions that can only be described as cruel. But one cannot simply blame Empire for this, even when and if it exacerbates the problem.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we define political prisoners who are also prisoners of Empire? Our August 5, 2020 report on political prisoners states:</p>\n<p>“Our definition of political prisoners refers to people who are incarcerated for alleged crimes related to resistance and liberation from repression. We believe that these cases should not be treated as isolated, ‘common’ crimes, but [cases that] require a political solution. In many cases, those in jail are there because of false allegations or because they were framed and railroaded through the courts. Our list is not only of political prisoners, but also of what we term “prisoners of Empire.” By that, we mean people who are jailed because of activities that constitute a direct challenge to the national and international dominance of U.S., NATO, and transnational capitalist imperialism.”</p>\n<p>We also note in our listing that,</p>\n<p>“…political prisoners […] require a political solution […] Whether the circumstances of the alleged crimes are true or false, we strenuously reject the individualized and out-of-context treatment of these cases as simply ‘common crimes.’ Our listing of these prisoners does not constitute an endorsement of the tactics or immediate goals of every individual. We also recognize that people have a right to resist oppression, and the failure to do so can be, itself, a crime against the people. In many cases, those arrested have been set up, falsely accused, railroaded, and/or denied adequate defense and basic human rights. More often than not, they have received harsher sentences than usual because of the political nature of their activities.”</p>\n<p>Although the origins of our PP/POEs list date back to 2013, this is only the second comprehensive analysis we’ve published. The first analysis was in response to the 2020 uprising sparked by the extrajudicial killing of George Floyd. We admit that what we have could be significantly augmented.</p>\n<p>We need another major and exhaustive review of the definitions, criteria, and categories we employ. Towards that end, we’ve established a committee that will spend the next year revising all aspects of the list. This is an ongoing process, and if you have suggestions for improvements, we want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to send your suggestions to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"1c567d71796f5c5d5a5b5632736e7b32\">[email protected]</a></p>\n<p>One must also look at the back stories behind the numbers and trends. For instance, in 2018, we listed 50 political prisoners. After several minor revisions in the interim, in which the total was steady, we published a major update in August of 2020, following the peak of the 2020 uprising. We found that after the 2020 uprising, the number of PPs/POE had risen by 12.28% to 57.</p>\n<p>As of the present moment, the number has diminished to a count of 55 U.S. PP/POEs, as of August 10, 2022. The decline in the overall number can be attributed to paroles, completed sentences, as well as deaths, of several PP/POEs. Especially, over the past two years, several Black PP/POEs arrested in crackdowns during the previous century have died in prison or been released after decades behind bars. These include the MOVE 9 and participants in historic Black liberation struggles, both armed and unarmed.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we found 38.60% of PPs/POE were Black, and just over 72% were people of color. Today, the percentage of Black PP/POEs has dropped to 34.55% (19), while the overall number of people of color who are PPs/POE has dropped to 69% (38). Of the other PP/POEs who are people of color, 10.9% (6) are Latino; 5.45% (3) are North “American” Indigenous; 3.64% (2) are Asian-American (non-Arab, Middle Eastern, or Central Asian); and 16.36% (9) are Arab, Middle Eastern, African Muslim, or Central Asian (one PP/POE is of Pakistani heritage, and one PP/POE is included under both Latino and Arab, ME, etc.-heritage categories).</p>\n<p>As for the last category, we have included these together because we’ve found it difficult to find statistics related to these specific ethnic groups. Instead, we find the closest readily available statistics have to do with Muslims in prison—and Muslim is not an ethnicity and can include people from all over the world, including those who are not necessarily people of color.</p>\n<p>Although Muslim or perceived-as-Muslim peoples are not ethnicities, they are discriminated against as if they were, targeted as a class because of their actual or perceived religious identification. Similarly, prison population statistics regularly confuse the count of Latino prisoners by counting most of them simply as “white.”</p>\n<p>To understand the racism revealed in these percentages, we must compare them to the demographic percentages of the US population as a whole. Respectively, we find that the U.S. general population is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/VET605220#VET605220\">13.6% Black, 18.9% Latino, 1.3% Indigenous</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/03/new-estimates-show-u-s-muslim-population-continues-to-grow/\">1.1% “Muslim.”</a></p>\n<p>The racist application of the “criminal justice” system is a feature of the entire system, not just of political imprisonment, which itself reflects a larger reality. For instance, we find that Black persons are incarcerated at a rate <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/jail-inmates-2020-statistical-tables\">3.5 times higher than that of Whites</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696,357&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?w=779&ssl=1 779w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=300%2C154&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=768%2C394&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=150%2C77&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?resize=696%2C357&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"Progression from slavery to mass incarceration in US history\" width=\"612\" height=\"314\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/15/while-claiming-to-defend-freedom-around-the-world-the-u-s-has-dozens-of-political-prisoners-and-the-majority-are-people-of-color/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=779%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"779,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=300%2C154&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/progression-from-slavery-to-mass-incarceration-in.jpeg?fit=696%2C357&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2019/08/slavery-to-mass-incarceration\">benjerry.com</a></span></p>\n<p>We need to place the differences and the total number of PP/POEs within context. Among the U.S. PP/POEs, it is significant that just over 14.55% (8) of the total are those incarcerated for their activities during the 2020 Uprising. There are also still two PP/POEs that remain in jail for activities related to the Ferguson uprising in 2014, following the extrajudicial killing of Michael Brown. If we add those together, we find that 18.18% of U.S. PPs/POE have been jailed in relation to charges stemming from the birth and continued growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>How do we determine who and how many are PPs/POE because of anti-racist struggle? We count 22 of 55 PPs/POE, or 40%, arrested for domestic anti-racist actions. As an international solidarity organization, AFGJ is keenly aware that U.S. foreign policies and international relations are extensions of the same policies, attitudes, and actions that drive domestic racism. U.S. wars, sanctions, blockades, and Prison Imperialism are overwhelmingly wielded against nations with a large majority of people of color, countries of the Global South. We find that 11 PPs/POE are in jail for actions of international solidarity with specific nations targeted by Empire (as Noam Chomsky defines it, “an integrated policy of U.S. military and economic supremacy”).</p>\n<p>Another 8 are people involved in activities of self-determination, liberation, and defense of their territories from occupation, war, sanctions, and blockades.</p>\n<p>Among them are Simon Trinidad from Colombia, Ivan Vargas from Colombia, Alex Saab from Venezuela, the Virgin Island Three, Mun Chol, Myong, and Leonard Peltier (in defense of the Lakota nation in occupied South Dakota). Together, these represent 34.55% (19) of those engaged in struggle directly against the international application of U.S. racist and political repression. When we combine those arrested for domestic and international resistance to U.S. racism, we find that 42 of 55 PPs/POE, 76.36%, are incarcerated for acts of anti-racist resistance.</p>\n<p>In other words, more than three quarters of US/POEs are in jail for activities that can be described as anti-racist.</p>\n<p>We also count 5.54% (three) PP/POEs jailed for eco-defense. 7.27% (four) were arrested for activities generally or directly opposed to U.S. militarism and wars. 7.27% (the Cleveland Four) are in prison for generalized resistance to the U.S. political system and global capitalism. 3.64% (two) women are in jail for defending themselves from their abusers or rapists.</p>\n<p>As for the last category, the reality is that there are hundreds if not thousands we might include in that category. We need to pose several questions and investigations to determine who and how many of these there are and who, if not all, could be considered Prisoners of Empire. We ask the reader to be patient with us as we delve into this complex and challenging area of research for next year’s report.</p>\n<p>For now, we include Maddesyn George and Fran Thompson as emblematic cases for which we know there is a much higher total.</p>\n<p>We also note that there is overlap in some of these categories. For instance, Fran Thompson is included as a woman arrested for self-defense and an eco-defender, exacerbating her prosecution and sentencing. There are other cases where people are counted in more than one category.</p>\n<p>At the 2013 Tear Down the Walls conference in Tucson, Arizona, Margaret Prescod of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women’s Strike</a> argued that all those interned under the inherently racist and classist U.S. model of mass incarceration are political prisoners. That may not be our definition, but who can honestly claim she was wrong?</p>\n<p>In our list of classes of political imprisonment, we include those held in immigrant detention centers and those still held in occupied Cuba at the Guantánamo prison. But they are not counted among the 55 PPs/POE that we document.</p>\n<p>We do know this—even if we added the 36 inmates in Guantánamo, the thousands held in immigrant detention centers, the many women jailed for defending themselves against their rapists and abusers, and, therefore, in resistance to the patriarchal underpinnings of the Empire, these inclusions would only underscore what we already know: political imprisonment in the U.S. is a tool of racist as well as other easily identified forms of repression both at home and abroad, and all of these cases require political solutions, not individualized and decontextualized punishment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, systemic change is needed, which is another way of saying revolution.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

These are serious allegations.  Whereas the sanctions are  directed against Russia, the ultimate intent is to undermine the legitimacy of president-elect Donald Trump and his foreign policy stance in relation to Moscow. </em></p>\n<p><em>According to the US media, the sanctions against Moscow were intended to<strong> “Box in President-elect Donald J. Trump” </strong>because  Trump “has consistently cast doubt” that Putin was involved in the alleged hacking of the DNC.  </em><em>In an earlier report on Kremlin meddling, the NYT  (December 15) depicted Donald Trump as<strong> “…a Useful Idiot”… </strong><strong>an American president who doesn’t know he’s being played by a wily foreign power.</strong> (emphasis added)</em></p>\n<p><em>But the accusations against Trump have gone far beyond the “Box in” Narrative.<strong> </strong>The unspoken truth pertaining to Obama’s Executive Order is that <strong>the punishment was intended for Trump rather than Putin.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>The objective is not to “Box-In” the president-elect for his “unfamiliarity with the role of intelligence”.

Unlikely. They are part of a propaganda campaign on behalf of powerful corporate interests.</p>\n<p>What is at stake is tantamount to a carefully coordinated operation to destabilize the Trump presidency, characterized by several distinct components.</p>\n<p>The central objective of this project against Trump is to ensure the continuity of the Neocons’ foreign policy agenda geared towards global warfare and Worldwide economic conquest, which has dominated the US political landscape since September 2001.</p>\n<p>Let us first review the nature of the Neocons’ foreign policy stance.</p>\n<h2><strong>Background on The Neocons’ Foreign Policy Agenda</strong></h2>\n<p>In the wake of 9/11, two major shifts in US foreign policy were devised as part of the 2001 National Security Strategy (NSS).</p>\n<p>The first pertained to the “global war on terrorism” against Al Qaeda, the second introduced the preemptive “defensive war” doctrine. The objective was to present “preemptive military action” –meaning war as an act of “self-defense” against two categories of enemies, “rogue States” and “Islamic terrorists”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">“The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. …America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed.(National Security Strategy, White House, 2002, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">The preemptive war doctrine also included the preemptive use of nuclear weapons on a “first strike” basis (as a means of “self-defence”) against both nuclear and non-nuclear states. This concept of  a preemptive first strike nuclear attack was firmly endorsed by Hillary Clinton in her election campaign.</p>\n<p>In turn, the “Global War on Terrorism”(GWOT) launched in the wake of 9/11 has come to play a central role in justifying US-NATO military intervention in the Middle East on “humanitarian grounds” (R2P), including the instatement of so-called “No Fly Zones”. GWOT also constitutes  the cornerstone of media propaganda.</p>\n<p>The military and intelligence dimensions of the Neocons’ project are contained in<strong> The Project for the New American Century</strong> formulated prior to the accession of George W. Bush to the White House. The PNAC also posits a “Revolution in Military Affairs” requiring a massive budget outlay allocated to the development of advanced weapons systems including a new generation of nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-neocons-project-for-the-new-american-century-american-world-leadership-syria-next-to-pay-the-price/5305447\">The PNAC initiative was launched by William Kristol and Robert Kagan </a>whose wife Victoria Nuland, played a key role as Clinton’s Assistant Secretary of State in engineering the Euro-Maidan coup in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The Neocon project also includes a menu of “regime change”, “color revolutions”, economic sanctions and macro-economic reforms directed against countries which fail to conform to Washington’s demands.</p>\n<p>In turn, the globalization of war supports Wall Street’s global economic agenda: The (secretly negotiated) Atlantic and Pacific trade blocks (TPP, TTIP, CETA, TISA), coupled up with IMF- World Bank- WTO “surveillance” are an integral part of this hegemonic project, intimately related to US military and intelligence operations.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg\"><img title=\"project-new-american-century\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"512\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg 512w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century-400x232.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>“The Deep State” and The Clash of Powerful Corporate Interests</strong></h2>\n<p>Global capitalism is by no means monolithic. What is at stake are fundamental rivalries within the US establishment marked by the clash between competing corporate factions, each of which is intent upon exerting control over the incoming US presidency. In this regard,  Trump is not entirely in the pocket of the lobby groups. As a member of the establishment, he has his own corporate sponsors and fund raisers. His stated foreign policy agenda including his commitment to revise Washington’s relationship with Moscow does not fully conform with the interests of the defence contractors, which supported Clinton’s candidacy.</p>\n<p>There are powerful corporate interests on both sides, which are now clashing. There are also overlapping allegiances and “cross-cutting alliances” within the corporate establishment.  What we are witnessing are  “inter-capitalist rivalries” within the spheres of banking, oil and energy, the military industrial complex, etc.</p>\n<p>Is “The Deep State” divided?  These corporate rivalries are also characterized by strategic divisions and clashes within several agencies of the US State apparatus including the intelligence community and the military.  In this regard, the CIA is deeply embedded in the corporate media (CNN, NBC, NYT. WP, etc) which is waging a relentless smear campaign against  Trump and his alleged links to Moscow.</p>\n<p>But there is also a  countervailing campaign within the intelligence community against the dominant Neocon faction. In this regard, the Trump team is contemplating a streamlining of the CIA (aka purges). According to a member of the Trump transition team (quoted by the Wall Street Journal, January 4, 2017), “<em>The view from the Trump team is the intelligence world [is] becoming completely politicized, … They all need to be slimmed down. The focus will be on restructuring the agencies and how they interact.”</em> This project would also affect CIA operatives responsible for propaganda embedded within the mainstream media. This would inevitably create profound divisions and conflicts within the US intelligence apparatus, which could potentially backlash on the Trump presidency. it is unlikely that a Trump administration would be able to undermine the inner structures of US intelligence and CIA sponsored media propaganda.</p>\n<h2><strong>Continuity in US Foreign Policy? </strong></h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg\"><img title=\"kennan\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"192\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg 400w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan-246x300.jpg 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" /></a>Crafted in the late 1940s by US State Department official George F. Kennan, the “Truman Doctrine” sets the ideological foundations of America’s post-war hegemonic project.  What these State department documents reveal is continuity in US foreign policy  from “Containment” during the Cold War to today’s post 9/11 doctrine of “Pre-emptive Warfare”.</p>\n<p>In this regard, the Neocons’ <strong>Project for the New American Century’s</strong> blueprint (cited above) for global conquest should be viewed as the culmination of a post-war agenda of military hegemony and global economic domination formulated by the State Department in 1948 at the outset of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, successive Democratic and Republican administrations, from Harry Truman to George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been involved in carrying out this <strong>hegemonic blueprint for global domination</strong>, which the Pentagon  calls the “Long War”.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"kennanbook\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennanbook.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[5400067]\"><img title=\"kennanbook\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennanbook.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"92\" height=\"142\" /></a>In this regard, the Neocons have followed in the footsteps of  the “Truman Doctrine”. In the late 1940s, George F. Kennan called for building <strong>a dominant Anglo-American alliance</strong> based on “good relations between our country and [the] British Empire”.  In today’s world, this alliance largely characterizes the military axis between Washington and London, which plays a dominant role inside NATO to the detriment of Washington’s  (continental) European allies.  It also includes Canada and Australia as key strategic partners.</p>\n<p>Of significance, Kennan underscored the importance of <strong>preventing the development of continental European powers</strong> (e.g. Germany, France, Italy) which could compete with the Anglo-American axis. The objective during the Cold War and its aftermath was to prevent Europe from establishing political as well as economic ties with Russia. In turn, NATO largely dominated by the US has prevented both Germany and France from performing a strategic role in World affairs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trump Foreign Policy Realignments</strong></h2>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that a Trump administration would depart from the mainstay of US foreign policy.</p>\n<p>While the Trump team is committed to a socially regressive and racist right wing agenda on the domestic front, certain foreign policy realignments are possible including a softening of the sanctions against Russia, which could potentially have an impact on the multibillion dollar contracts of the military industrial complex. This in itself would be a significant achievement which could contribute to a period of Detente in East-West relations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while Trump has put together a right wing cabinet of generals, bankers and oil executives,  which largely conforms to the mainstay of the Republican Party, the bi-partisan “entente cordiale” between Democrats and Republicans has been broken. Meanwhile, there are powerful  voices within the GOP who are supportive of the “anti-Trump faction”.</p>\n<p>The divisions between these two competing factions are nonetheless significant. With regard to US foreign policy, they largely pertain to US-Russia bilateral relations which have been jeopardized by the Obama administration as well as to the ongoing US military agenda in Syria and Iraq. They also have a bearing on the European Union, which has been affected by Obama’s economic sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>The sanctions have resulted in a dramatic decline in EU trade and investment with the Russian Federation. In conformity with the “Truman Doctrine” discussed above, US foreign policy under the Neocons, particularly since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, had sought <strong>to dismantle the Franco-German alliance and weaken the European Union.</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Of relevance in relation to recent developments in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, George F. Kennan explicitly pointed in his 1948 State Department brief, to<strong> “a policy of containment of Germany, within Western Europe”. </strong>What Kennan’s observations suggest is that the <strong>US should be  supportive of  a European Project only inasmuch as it supports US hegemonic interests. </strong>And that is precisely what the Neocons have achieved under the Bush and Obama administrations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Today both Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel are taking their orders directly from Washington. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was a turning point. The election of pro-US political leaders (President Sarkozy in France and Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany) was conducive to a weakening of national sovereignty, leading to the demise of the Franco-German alliance. ” (Michel Chossudovsky <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/americas-blueprint-for-global-domination-from-containment-to-pre-emptive-war-the-1948-truman-doctrine/5400067\">America’s Blueprint for Global Domination: From “Containment” to “Pre-emptive War”.</a> Global Research, 2014)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The more significant question is whether this realignment under a Trump administration will restrain the deployment of NATO troops and military hardware in Eastern Europe on Russia’s doorstep. Will it be conducive to nuclear disarmament?</p>\n<p>While Trump’s foreign policy agenda has been the target of “dirty politics” by the Clinton faction, the new administration has powerful corporate backers who will no doubt challenge the Neocons including those operating within the intelligence community. It is worth noting that Trump also has the support of the pro-Israel lobby as well as Israeli intelligence.

While the MSM routinely criticize politicians in high office including the president of the US, the media narrative in this case is fundamentally different. The incoming president is the target of an organized media smear campaign which will not subside upon Trump’s accession to the White House.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, an engineered and coordinated protest movement against Trump has been ongoing since November 8. In fact it started on the evening of November 8 prior to the announcement of the election results.  The protests have all the appearances of  a “color revolution” style op.</p>\n<p>The media also provides a biased coverage of the engineered protest movement. The organizers and recruiters are serving the interests of  powerful corporate lobby groups including the defence contractors. They are not serving the interests of the American people</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that these various initiatives including the Disrupt campaign will have a significant bearing on Trump’s inauguration. Our assessment suggests, however, that the president-elect will accede to the White House amidst an aura of controversy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Impeachment is the “Talking Point”</strong></h2>\n<p>The propaganda campaign will continue in the wake of Trump’s inauguration intimating accusations of treason.

As far as the public were concerned the Kaiser was the killer, the Germans ate Belgian babies and the repulsive Teutonic octopus had to be stopped at all costs.</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that the entire conflict was about imperial power, commerce and competition between the three grandchildren of the British Queen Victoria was conveniently ignored. In July 1916 British newspaper reports on the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest battles in human history, famously read “Our casualties are not heavy,” an utterly misleading headline which sounds disturbingly familiar today.</p>\n<p>When we consider Americas most recent large-scale military misadventures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya these ill-advised and bloody failures have yet again been portrayed as the “good guys against the bad guys”, it’s the Cowboys against the Indians, the dangerous and untrustworthy Muslim savages against the very existence of Western civilisation.</p>\n<p>The immeasurable human suffering that these wars have visited on the innocent populations seldom features. American complicity and responsibility for creating the very problems they now seek to “solve” is bizarrely entirely ignored in its client media.</p>\n<p>Today’s conflict in Ukraine is no exception, a similar narrative is peddled with the historical truths about where conflict grew from remaining unreported. Some of the most critical facts relating to Ukraine are routinely and conveniently rendered invisible by the mainstream media, such as when this civil war began and most crucially, who paid for and built the scaffolding on which it is now burning.</p>\n<p>It is of course unpopular in any instance to swim against the flow of the tide, to be the child suggesting the emperor has no clothes, and to challenge “realities” that have been broadly accepted by a trusting public. Despite the gross imbalance in the presentation of the facts, up to now at least dissent was something accepted as a privilege of western democratic society, that freedom of speech and opinion is however in grave danger, particularly if it is based on inconvenient truths.</p>\n<h2><strong>The “Absolute Truth”</strong></h2>\n<p>When it comes to Ukraine <strong>a new, dangerous and lavishly funded weapon in the counter truth war has been deployed by western governments and media,</strong> I call it “Absolute Truth”. The Absolute truth doesn’t tolerate any challenges, when its allegations are proven false those realities are suppressed and ignored.</p>\n<p>It immediately and efficiently targets any dissent from the prescribed narrative and brands challengers as “enemies,” “foreign agents,” or “useful idiots.” Critically there is no room for debate of any kind, there is no analysis of facts, there is only their Absolute Truth.</p>\n<p>Should a journalist, State or individual question this Absolute Truth or merely suggest an objective analysis of the facts they are immediately and brutally marginalised and then targeted for retribution. This determined and choreographed punishment can range from the loss of a job to the isolation of an entire nation with threats of violence commonplace.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=696,696&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?w=800&ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=768%2C768&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=696%2C696&ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"464\" height=\"464\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/13/war-propaganda-about-ukraine-starting-to-wear-thin/1385077_orig/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=800%2C800&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"1385077_orig\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=300%2C300&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=696%2C696&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/BowesChay/status/1505248984255840261/photo/1\">twitter.com</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>The fact that the West’s “Absolute Truth” narrative relies implicitly on mass censorship and the wholesale destruction of freedom of speech</strong> is apparently irrelevant to its architects and disciples, if these pillars of liberal democracy must be abandoned in this war against the facts, so be it.</p>\n<p>Absolute truth also has a selective attitude when it comes to the behavior of its idols, when Mr Zelensky’s election with the assistance, cash and muscle of a corrupt oligarch is highlighted this is ignored, when his antidemocratic banning of all opposition and the imprisonment of its leaders comes up, its fine. if the Absolute Truth requires the acceptance and deployment of brutal Nazi militias against civilians, (previously designated by the west as terrorists) that is again entirely acceptable.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Absolute truth brigade have a magical ability to erase history, assign hero status to mass murders (Stepan Bandera) and demonise those that defeated Nazism in Europe. The Absolute Truth now defines the narrative, the facts do not, facts and independent evidence will be selectively deployed if at all, those that challenge this are immediately designated as collaborators, war mongers and enemies of democracy.</p>\n<p>Another sinister element of the cult of Absolute Truth is the reluctance to correct the record or admit when you get it wrong, from the “massacre” at Snake Island that never happened to the fake headlines about the Mariupol maternity hospital to name but a few, there is never any attempt to correct the record which begs the question

respected Amnesty international bravely countered the Absolute truth with indisputable facts, it was itself attacked by an increasingly paranoid Zelensky.</strong> There is now a distinct element of “the boy who cried wolf” about Zelensky’s persistent and now routine allegations of genocide, targeting of civilians and the apparent desire to “erase Ukraine from the map”.</p>\n<p>Any cursory examination of the facts around the Ukrainian Army’s “counter terrorist” operation against its own people in 2014 in Donbas would suggest it was an increasingly radicalised Ukrainian military that first assaulted the ethnic Russian populations in the east in 2014.</p>\n<p>As NATOs exceptionally costly and increasingly destructive proxy war against Russia grinds on, the prospect of any military victory for Ukraine fades almost hourly, the likelihood that Russia will seek settlement also fades by the day, any incentive to do so now strategically valueless.</p>\n<p>Western support for Zelensky’s seemingly rudderless and incompetent regime is privately wavering as the impact of ham-fisted sanctions against Russia threatens social cohesion in Europe and America alongside a global energy crisis.</p>\n<p>Promised counter offensives in the south have not materialized, the much vaunted “Million-man army” has failed to appear and yet again, the American and European press that presented this as fact have not rowed back on their outlandish claims.</p>\n<p>The harsh reality of war is seemingly lost on the “absolute Truth” brigade who are happmericy to “stand with Ukraine” but will never stand in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The western public are a fickle audience, given the lack of initial scrutiny generally applied to the mainstream narrative on Ukraine it’s likely that as more of the inconvenient truths about Zelensky, his junta and the realities of this conflict appear, more and more westerns will be creeping into their yards in the dead of night to take down their hastily hoisted Ukrainian flags.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the best efforts of those that have funded, molded and justified this proxy war the truth has a habit of resurfacing. It will be impossible to “manage” the oncoming tide of reality that will gush out of Ukraine as the western powers refocus on their self-inflicted domestic troubles this winter, Zelensky himself may become the fall guy for the failed NATO escapade in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing about those inconvenient facts, they keep persisting under the surface, the truth doesn’t have a sell by date, and it is patient, the memory of the countless dead demands it to be.</p>\n<p>And of course, as good old Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool part of the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

“massacre” at Snake Island that never happened to the fake headlines about the Mariupol maternity hospital to name but a few, there is never any attempt to correct the record which begs the question

respected Amnesty international bravely countered the Absolute truth with indisputable facts, it was itself attacked by an increasingly paranoid Zelensky.</strong> There is now a distinct element of “the boy who cried wolf” about Zelensky’s persistent and now routine allegations of genocide, targeting of civilians and the apparent desire to “erase Ukraine from the map”.</p>\n<p>Any cursory examination of the facts around the Ukrainian Army’s “counter terrorist” operation against its own people in 2014 in Donbas would suggest it was an increasingly radicalised Ukrainian military that first assaulted the ethnic Russian populations in the east in 2014.</p>\n<p>As NATOs exceptionally costly and increasingly destructive proxy war against Russia grinds on, the prospect of any military victory for Ukraine fades almost hourly, the likelihood that Russia will seek settlement also fades by the day, any incentive to do so now strategically valueless.</p>\n<p>Western support for Zelensky’s seemingly rudderless and incompetent regime is privately wavering as the impact of ham-fisted sanctions against Russia threatens social cohesion in Europe and America alongside a global energy crisis.</p>\n<p>Promised counter offensives in the south have not materialized, the much vaunted “Million-man army” has failed to appear and yet again, the American and European press that presented this as fact have not rowed back on their outlandish claims.</p>\n<p>The harsh reality of war is seemingly lost on the “absolute Truth” brigade who are happmericy to “stand with Ukraine” but will never stand in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The western public are a fickle audience, given the lack of initial scrutiny generally applied to the mainstream narrative on Ukraine it’s likely that as more of the inconvenient truths about Zelensky, his junta and the realities of this conflict appear, more and more westerns will be creeping into their yards in the dead of night to take down their hastily hoisted Ukrainian flags.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the best efforts of those that have funded, molded and justified this proxy war the truth has a habit of resurfacing. It will be impossible to “manage” the oncoming tide of reality that will gush out of Ukraine as the western powers refocus on their self-inflicted domestic troubles this winter, Zelensky himself may become the fall guy for the failed NATO escapade in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing about those inconvenient facts, they keep persisting under the surface, the truth doesn’t have a sell by date, and it is patient, the memory of the countless dead demands it to be.</p>\n<p>And of course, as good old Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool part of the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

While the U.S. and its NATO allies prosecute their proxy conflict on the ground, in the air, and at sea, another illicit battle is being fought on social media, TV and radio.</p>\n<p>Of course, propaganda and the winning of “hearts and minds” is nothing new when it comes to conflict.

respected Amnesty international bravely countered the Absolute truth with indisputable facts, it was itself attacked by an increasingly paranoid Zelensky.</strong> There is now a distinct element of “the boy who cried wolf” about Zelensky’s persistent and now routine allegations of genocide, targeting of civilians and the apparent desire to “erase Ukraine from the map”.</p>\n<p>Any cursory examination of the facts around the Ukrainian Army’s “counter terrorist” operation against its own people in 2014 in Donbas would suggest it was an increasingly radicalised Ukrainian military that first assaulted the ethnic Russian populations in the east in 2014.</p>\n<p>As NATOs exceptionally costly and increasingly destructive proxy war against Russia grinds on, the prospect of any military victory for Ukraine fades almost hourly, the likelihood that Russia will seek settlement also fades by the day, any incentive to do so now strategically valueless.</p>\n<p>Western support for Zelensky’s seemingly rudderless and incompetent regime is privately wavering as the impact of ham-fisted sanctions against Russia threatens social cohesion in Europe and America alongside a global energy crisis.</p>\n<p>Promised counter offensives in the south have not materialized, the much vaunted “Million-man army” has failed to appear and yet again, the American and European press that presented this as fact have not rowed back on their outlandish claims.</p>\n<p>The harsh reality of war is seemingly lost on the “absolute Truth” brigade who are happmericy to “stand with Ukraine” but will never stand in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The western public are a fickle audience, given the lack of initial scrutiny generally applied to the mainstream narrative on Ukraine it’s likely that as more of the inconvenient truths about Zelensky, his junta and the realities of this conflict appear, more and more westerns will be creeping into their yards in the dead of night to take down their hastily hoisted Ukrainian flags.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the best efforts of those that have funded, molded and justified this proxy war the truth has a habit of resurfacing. It will be impossible to “manage” the oncoming tide of reality that will gush out of Ukraine as the western powers refocus on their self-inflicted domestic troubles this winter, Zelensky himself may become the fall guy for the failed NATO escapade in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing about those inconvenient facts, they keep persisting under the surface, the truth doesn’t have a sell by date, and it is patient, the memory of the countless dead demands it to be.</p>\n<p>And of course, as good old Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool part of the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

While the U.S. and its NATO allies prosecute their proxy conflict on the ground, in the air, and at sea, another illicit battle is being fought on social media, TV and radio.</p>\n<p>Of course, propaganda and the winning of “hearts and minds” is nothing new when it comes to conflict. As far back as the 19th century Governments were aware of how important the narrative was at home, they actively sought to suppress details which they thought may be offensive or unhelpful to the home audience.</p>\n<p>In the second Boer war in South Africa (1899-1902), when the British Army’s colonial war was failing it resorted to imprisoning Boer Women and children in vast ill equipped concentration camps where a stunning 26,000 of them would die from starvation, ill treatment and disease. The British actively considered creating a publicity campaign to hide the true horror of the hellish camps, including false reports and newspaper stories.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=674,400&ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?w=674&ssl=1 674w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=150%2C89&ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"558\" height=\"331\" data-attachment-=\"data-attachment-\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/13/war-propaganda-about-ukraine-starting-to-wear-thin/word-image-44120-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=674%2C400&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"674,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"word-image-44120-3\" data-image-description=\"data-image-description\" data-image-caption=\"data-image-caption\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=300%2C178&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=674%2C400&ssl=1\" /></p>\n<p><span>Black woman in British concentration camp in the Boer War.

[Source: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/featured/white-washing-the-boer-war/\">halifaxexaminer.ca</a>]</span></p>\n<p>Again, during World War I the gruesome details of mass casualties in the horrendous and inhumane trenches of the western front were also sterilized and minimized for the home audience. As far as the public were concerned the Kaiser was the killer, the Germans ate Belgian babies and the repulsive Teutonic octopus had to be stopped at all costs.</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that the entire conflict was about imperial power, commerce and competition between the three grandchildren of the British Queen Victoria was conveniently ignored. In July 1916 British newspaper reports on the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest battles in human history, famously read “Our casualties are not heavy,” an utterly misleading headline which sounds disturbingly familiar today.</p>\n<p>When we consider Americas most recent large-scale military misadventures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya these ill-advised and bloody failures have yet again been portrayed as the “good guys against the bad guys”, it’s the Cowboys against the Indians, the dangerous and untrustworthy Muslim savages against the very existence of Western civilisation.</p>\n<p>The immeasurable human suffering that these wars have visited on the innocent populations seldom features. American complicity and responsibility for creating the very problems they now seek to “solve” is bizarrely entirely ignored in its client media.</p>\n<p>Today’s conflict in Ukraine is no exception, a similar narrative is peddled with the historical truths about where conflict grew from remaining unreported. Some of the most critical facts relating to Ukraine are routinely and conveniently rendered invisible by the mainstream media, such as when this civil war began and most crucially, who paid for and built the scaffolding on which it is now burning.</p>\n<p>It is of course unpopular in any instance to swim against the flow of the tide, to be the child suggesting the emperor has no clothes, and to challenge “realities” that have been broadly accepted by a trusting public. Despite the gross imbalance in the presentation of the facts, up to now at least dissent was something accepted as a privilege of western democratic society, that freedom of speech and opinion is however in grave danger, particularly if it is based on inconvenient truths.</p>\n<h2><strong>The “Absolute Truth”</strong></h2>\n<p>When it comes to Ukraine <strong>a new, dangerous and lavishly funded weapon in the counter truth war has been deployed by western governments and media,</strong> I call it “Absolute Truth”.

respected Amnesty international bravely countered the Absolute truth with indisputable facts, it was itself attacked by an increasingly paranoid Zelensky.</strong> There is now a distinct element of “the boy who cried wolf” about Zelensky’s persistent and now routine allegations of genocide, targeting of civilians and the apparent desire to “erase Ukraine from the map”.</p>\n<p>Any cursory examination of the facts around the Ukrainian Army’s “counter terrorist” operation against its own people in 2014 in Donbas would suggest it was an increasingly radicalised Ukrainian military that first assaulted the ethnic Russian populations in the east in 2014.</p>\n<p>As NATOs exceptionally costly and increasingly destructive proxy war against Russia grinds on, the prospect of any military victory for Ukraine fades almost hourly, the likelihood that Russia will seek settlement also fades by the day, any incentive to do so now strategically valueless.</p>\n<p>Western support for Zelensky’s seemingly rudderless and incompetent regime is privately wavering as the impact of ham-fisted sanctions against Russia threatens social cohesion in Europe and America alongside a global energy crisis.</p>\n<p>Promised counter offensives in the south have not materialized, the much vaunted “Million-man army” has failed to appear and yet again, the American and European press that presented this as fact have not rowed back on their outlandish claims.</p>\n<p>The harsh reality of war is seemingly lost on the “absolute Truth” brigade who are happmericy to “stand with Ukraine” but will never stand in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The western public are a fickle audience, given the lack of initial scrutiny generally applied to the mainstream narrative on Ukraine it’s likely that as more of the inconvenient truths about Zelensky, his junta and the realities of this conflict appear, more and more westerns will be creeping into their yards in the dead of night to take down their hastily hoisted Ukrainian flags.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the best efforts of those that have funded, molded and justified this proxy war the truth has a habit of resurfacing. It will be impossible to “manage” the oncoming tide of reality that will gush out of Ukraine as the western powers refocus on their self-inflicted domestic troubles this winter, Zelensky himself may become the fall guy for the failed NATO escapade in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing about those inconvenient facts, they keep persisting under the surface, the truth doesn’t have a sell by date, and it is patient, the memory of the countless dead demands it to be.</p>\n<p>And of course, as good old Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool part of the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

As a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/al-qaeda-terrorism-isis.html\">United Nations report released in July</a> concluded, “Al Qaeda is not viewed as posing an immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan because it lacks an external operational capability and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.”</p>\n<p>Just as former president Barack Obama stated that “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-dead\">Justice has been done</a>” after he assassinated <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong>, Biden said, “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/\">Now justice has been delivered</a>” when he announced the assassination of Zawahiri.</p>\n<p>Retaliation, however, does not constitute justice.</p>\n<p>Targeted, or political, assassinations are extrajudicial executions. They are deliberate and unlawful killings meted out by order of, or with acquiescence of, a government. Extrajudicial executions are implemented outside a judicial framework.</p>\n<p>The fact that Zawahiri did not pose an imminent threat is precisely why his assassination was illegal.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zawahiri’s Assassination Violated International Law</strong></h2>\n<p>Extrajudicial executions are prohibited by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, making it part of U.S. law under the Constitution’s supremacy clause. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights\">Article 6 of the ICCPR</a> states, “Every human being has the inherent right to life.

No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.” In its interpretation of Article 6, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/CCPR/GCArticle6/GCArticle6_EN.pdf\">The UN Human Rights Committee opined</a> that all human beings are entitled to the protection of the right to life “without distinction of any kind, including for persons suspected or convicted of even the most serious crimes.”</p>\n<p>“Outside the context of active hostilities, the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal,” <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AgnesCallamard/status/1212918159096864768\">tweeted</a>Agnès Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. “Intentionally lethal or potentially lethal force can only be used where strictly necessary to protect against an imminent threat to life.” In order to be lawful, the United States would need to demonstrate that the target “constituted an imminent threat to others,” Callamard said.</p>\n<p>Moreover, willful killing is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, punishable as a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act. A targeted killing is lawful only when deemed necessary to protect life, and no other means (including apprehension or nonlethal incapacitation) is available to protect life.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zawahiri’s Assassination Violated U.S. Law</strong></h2>\n<p>The drone strike that killed Zawahiri also violated the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp\">War Powers Resolution</a>, which lists three situations in which the president can introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities:</p>\n<p>First, pursuant to a congressional declaration of war, which has not occurred since World War II. Second, in “a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.” (Zawahiri’s presence in Afghanistan more than 20 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks did not constitute a “national emergency.”) Third, when there is “specific statutory authorization,” such as an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).</p>\n<p>In 2001, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf\">Congress adopted an AUMF</a> that authorized the president to use military force against individuals, groups and countries that had contributed to the 9/11 attacks “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”</p>\n<p>Zawahiri was one of a small circle of people widely believed to have planned the 2001 hijacking of four airplanes, three of which were flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center buildings. But since he did not pose “an immediate international threat” before the U.S. targeted him for assassination, he should have been arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>The attack against Zawahiri violated Obama’s targeting rules, which required that the target pose a “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/presidential_policy_guidance.pdf\">continuing imminent threat.</a>” Although <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Donald Trump relaxed </a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Obama’s rules</a>, Biden is conducting <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/biden-drones.html\">a secret review</a>to establish his own standards for targeting killing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Biden Continues to Launch Illegal Drone Strikes</strong></h2>\n<p>In spite of the Biden administration’s claim that no civilians were killed during the strike on Zawahiri, there has been no independent evidence to support that assertion.</p>\n<p>The assassination of Zawahiri came nearly a year after <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/war-in-afghanistan-isnt-over-its-taking-the-form-of-illegal-drone-strikes/\">Biden launched an illegal strike</a> as he withdrew U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Ten civilians were killed in that attack. The U.S. Central Command admitted the strike was “a tragic mistake” after <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">an extensive </a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\"><em>New York Times </em></a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">investigation </a>put a lie to the prior U.S. declaration that it was a “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-drone-strike-mistake-civilians-killed-pentagon/\">righteous strike</a>.”</p>\n<p>Biden declared that although he was withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan, he would mount “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/politics/cia-afghanistan.html\">over-the-horizon</a>” attacks from outside the country even without troops on the ground. We can expect the Biden administration to conduct future illegal drone strikes that kill civilians.</p>\n<p>The 2001 AUMF has been used to justify <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2022/8/3/23289167/zawahiri-war-terror-afghanistan-us-biden\">U.S. military actions in 85 countries</a>. Congress must repeal it and replace it with a new AUMF specifically requiring that any use of force comply with U.S. obligations under international law.</p>\n<p>In addition, Congress should revisit the War Powers Resolution and explicitly limit the president’s authority to use force to that which is necessary to repel a sudden or imminent attack.</p>\n<p>Finally, the United States must end its “global war on terror” once and for all. Drone strikes terrorize and kill countless civilians and make us more vulnerable to terrorism.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

As a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/al-qaeda-terrorism-isis.html\">United Nations report released in July</a> concluded, “Al Qaeda is not viewed as posing an immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan because it lacks an external operational capability and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.”</p>\n<p>Just as former president Barack Obama stated that “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-dead\">Justice has been done</a>” after he assassinated <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong>, Biden said, “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/\">Now justice has been delivered</a>” when he announced the assassination of Zawahiri.</p>\n<p>Retaliation, however, does not constitute justice.</p>\n<p>Targeted, or political, assassinations are extrajudicial executions.

Second, in “a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.” (Zawahiri’s presence in Afghanistan more than 20 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks did not constitute a “national emergency.”) Third, when there is “specific statutory authorization,” such as an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).</p>\n<p>In 2001, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf\">Congress adopted an AUMF</a> that authorized the president to use military force against individuals, groups and countries that had contributed to the 9/11 attacks “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”</p>\n<p>Zawahiri was one of a small circle of people widely believed to have planned the 2001 hijacking of four airplanes, three of which were flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center buildings.

But since he did not pose “an immediate international threat” before the U.S. targeted him for assassination, he should have been arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>The attack against Zawahiri violated Obama’s targeting rules, which required that the target pose a “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/presidential_policy_guidance.pdf\">continuing imminent threat.</a>” Although <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Donald Trump relaxed </a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Obama’s rules</a>, Biden is conducting <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/biden-drones.html\">a secret review</a>to establish his own standards for targeting killing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Biden Continues to Launch Illegal Drone Strikes</strong></h2>\n<p>In spite of the Biden administration’s claim that no civilians were killed during the strike on Zawahiri, there has been no independent evidence to support that assertion.</p>\n<p>The assassination of Zawahiri came nearly a year after <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/war-in-afghanistan-isnt-over-its-taking-the-form-of-illegal-drone-strikes/\">Biden launched an illegal strike</a> as he withdrew U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Ten civilians were killed in that attack. The U.S. Central Command admitted the strike was “a tragic mistake” after <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">an extensive </a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\"><em>New York Times </em></a><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">investigation </a>put a lie to the prior U.S. declaration that it was a “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-drone-strike-mistake-civilians-killed-pentagon/\">righteous strike</a>.”</p>\n<p>Biden declared that although he was withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan, he would mount “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/politics/cia-afghanistan.html\">over-the-horizon</a>” attacks from outside the country even without troops on the ground. We can expect the Biden administration to conduct future illegal drone strikes that kill civilians.</p>\n<p>The 2001 AUMF has been used to justify <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2022/8/3/23289167/zawahiri-war-terror-afghanistan-us-biden\">U.S. military actions in 85 countries</a>. Congress must repeal it and replace it with a new AUMF specifically requiring that any use of force comply with U.S. obligations under international law.</p>\n<p>In addition, Congress should revisit the War Powers Resolution and explicitly limit the president’s authority to use force to that which is necessary to repel a sudden or imminent attack.</p>\n<p>Finally, the United States must end its “global war on terror” once and for all. Drone strikes terrorize and kill countless civilians and make us more vulnerable to terrorism.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

And to make sure that that doesn’t happen.” George Friedman, STRATFOR CEO at The Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. It’s about Germany and, in particular, a pipeline that connects Germany to Russia called Nord Stream 2. Washington sees the pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at every turn. Even so, Nord Stream has pushed ahead and is now fully-operational and ready-to-go. Once German regulators provide the final certification, the gas deliveries will begin. German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean and inexpensive energy while Russia will see a significant boost to their gas revenues. It’s a win-win situation for both parties.</span></p>\n<p><span>The US Foreign Policy establishment is not happy about these developments. They don’t want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas because commerce builds trust and trust leads to the expansion of trade. As relations grow warmer, more trade barriers are lifted, regulations are eased, travel and tourism increase, and a new security architecture evolves. <b>In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners, there is no need for US military bases, no need for expensive US-made weapons and missile systems, and no need for NATO. </b></span></p>\n<p><span><b>There’s also no need to transact energy deals in US Dollars or to stockpile US Treasuries to balance accounts. </b>Transactions between business partners can be conducted in their own currencies which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream.<b> It’s not just a pipeline, it’s a window into the future; a future in which Europe and Asia are drawn closer together into a massive free trade zone that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the US on the outside looking in.</b> </span></p>\n<p><span>Warmer relations between Germany and Russia signal an end to the “unipolar” world order the US has overseen for the last 75 years. A German-Russo alliance threatens to hasten the decline of the Superpower that is presently inching closer to the abyss. This is why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream and keep Germany within its orbit. It’s a matter of survival.</span></p>\n<p><span>That’s where Ukraine comes into the picture. <b>Ukraine is Washington’s ‘weapon of choice’ for torpedoing Nord Stream and putting a wedge between Germany and Russia. </b>The strategy is taken from page one of the US Foreign Policy Handbook under the rubric: Divide and Rule.<b> </b></span></p>\n<p><span><b>Washington needs to create the perception that Russia poses a security threat to Europe. That’s the goal. They need to show that Putin is a bloodthirsty aggressor with a hair-trigger temper who cannot be trusted.</b> To that end, the media has been given the assignment of reiterating over and over again, “Russia is planning to invade Ukraine.” What’s left unsaid is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and that the US has invaded or toppled regimes in more than 50 countries in the same period of time, and that the US maintains over 800 military bases in countries around the world. None of this is reported by the media, instead the focus is on “evil Putin” who has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border threatening to plunge all of Europe into another bloody war.</span></p>\n<p><span>All of the hysterical war propaganda is created with the intention of manufacturing a crisis that can be used to isolate, demonize and, ultimately, splinter Russia into smaller units. <b>The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany.</b> Check out this excerpt from an article by Michael Hudson at The Unz Review:</span></p>\n<p><span>“The only way left for U.S. diplomats to block European purchases <b>is to goad Russia into a military response</b> and then claim that avenging this response outweighs any purely national economic interest. As hawkish Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, explained in a State Department press briefing on January 27: <b>“If Russia invades Ukraine one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”</b> (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.unz.com/mhudson/americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies/\" href=\"https://www.unz.com/mhudson/americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies/\">“America’s Real Adversaries Are Its European and Other Allies”</a>, The Unz Review)</span></p>\n<p><span>There it is in black and white.<b> The Biden team wants to “goad Russia into a military response” in order to sabotage NordStream.</b> That implies there will be some kind of provocation designed to induce Putin to send his troops across the border to defend the ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country. If Putin takes the bait, the response would be swift and harsh. The media will excoriate the action as a threat to all of Europe while leaders around the world will denounce Putin as the “new Hitler”. This is Washington’s strategy in a nutshell, and <b>the whole production is being orchestrated with one goal in mind; to make it politically impossible for the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to wave NordStream through the final approval process. </b></span></p>\n<p><span>Given what we know about Washington’s opposition to Nord Stream, readers may wonder why earlier in the year the Biden administration lobbied Congress NOT to impose more sanctions on the project. The answer to that question is simple: Domestic politics. Germany is currently decommissioning its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to make up for the energy shortfall. Also, the threat of economic sanctions is a “turn-off” for Germans who see them as a sign of foreign meddling. “Why is the United States interfering in our energy decisions,” asks the average German. “Washington should mind its own business and stay out of ours.” This is precisely the response one would expect from any reasonable person.</span></p>\n<p><span>Then, there’s this from Al Jazeera:</span></p>\n<p><span><b>“Germans in the majority support the project, it is only parts of the elite and media who are against the pipeline</b>…</span></p>\n<p><span><b>“The more the US talks about sanctioning or criticizes the project, the more it becomes popular in German society,”</b> said Stefan Meister, a Russia and eastern Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations.” (<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/25/ukraine-russia-what-is-nord-steam-2-and-why-is-it-contentious\" href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/25/ukraine-russia-what-is-nord-steam-2-and-why-is-it-contentious\">“Nord Stream 2: Why Russia’s pipeline to Europe divides the West”</a>, AlJazeera)</span></p>\n<p><span>So, public opinion is solidly behind Nord Stream which helps to explain why Washington settled on a new approach. Sanctions are not going to work, so <b>Uncle Sam has flipped to Plan B: Create a big enough external threat that Germany will be forced to block the opening of the pipeline</b>. Frankly, the strategy smacks of desperation, but you have to be impressed by Washington’s perseverance. They might be down by 5 runs in the bottom of the 9th, but they haven’t thrown in the towel just yet. They’re going to give it one last shot and see if they can make some headway.</span></p>\n<p><span>On Monday, President Biden held his first joint-press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The ballyhoo surrounding the event was simply unprecedented.<b> Everything was orchestrated to manufacture a “crisis atmosphere” that Biden used to pressure the chancellor in the direction of US policy</b>. Earlier in the week, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki repeatedly said that a “Russian invasion was imminent.” Her comments were followed by State Department flak Nick Price opining that the Intel agencies had provided him with details of an alleged Russian-backed “false flag” operation they expected to take place in the near future in east Ukraine. Price’s warning was followed on Sunday morning by national security advisor Jake Sullivan claiming that a Russian invasion could happen at any time maybe “even tomorrow.” This was just days after Bloomberg News agency had published its sensational and utterly-false headline that “Russia Invades Ukraine”.</span></p>\n<p><span>Can you see the pattern here? Can you see how these baseless claims were all used to apply pressure to the unsuspecting German chancellor who seemed oblivious to the campaign that was aimed at him?</span></p>\n<p><span>As one might expect, the final blow was delivered by the American president himself. During the press conference Biden stated emphatically that,</span></p>\n<p><span><b>“If Russia invades … there will no longer [be] a Nord Stream 2.. We will bring an end to it.”</b></span></p>\n<p><span>So, now Washington sets policy for Germany???</span></p>\n<p><span>What insufferable arrogance!</span></p>\n<p><span>The German chancellor was taken aback by Biden’s comments which clearly were not part of the original script. Even so,<b> Scholz never agreed to cancel Nord Stream and refused to even mention the pipeline by name. If Biden thought he could sandbag the leader of the world’s third biggest economy by cornering him in a public forum, he guessed wrong</b>. Germany remains committed to launching Nord Stream regardless of potential flare-ups in far-flung Ukraine. But that could change at any time. After all, who knows what incitements Washington might be planning in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are prepared to sacrifice in order to put a wedge between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is willing to take to slow America’s decline and prevent a new “polycentric” world order from emerging? Anything could happen in the weeks ahead. Anything.</span></p>\n<p><span>For now, Germany is in the catbird seat. It’s up to Scholz to decide how the matter will be settled. <b>Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he cave in to Biden’s relentless arm twisting?</b> Will he chart a new course that strengthens new alliances in the bustling Eurasian corridor or will he throw his support behind Washington’s crazed geopolitical ambitions? <b>Will he accept Germany’s pivotal role in a new world order</b>— in which many emerging centers of power share equally in global governance and where the leadership remains unflinchingly committed to multilateralism, peaceful development and security for all–<b> or will he try to prop up the tattered post-War system that has clearly outlived its shelf-life?</b></span></p>\n<p><span>One thing is certain; whatever Germany decides is bound to affect us all.</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Since 1988 the company has put itself in a position to de facto control the Federal Reserve, most Wall Street mega-banks, including Goldman Sachs, the Davos World Economic Forum Great Reset, the Biden Administration and, if left unchecked, the economic future of our world. BlackRock is the epitome of what Mussolini called Corporatism, where an unelected corporate elite dictates top down to the population. </span></em></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">How the world’s largest “shadow bank” exercises this enormous power over the world ought to concern us. BlackRock since Larry Fink founded it in 1988 has managed to assemble unique financial software and assets that no other entity has. BlackRock’s Aladdin risk-management system, a software tool that can track and analyze trading, monitors more than $18 trillion in assets for 200 financial firms including the Federal Reserve and European central banks. He who “monitors” also knows, we can imagine. BlackRock has been called a financial “Swiss Army Knife — institutional investor, money manager, private equity firm, and global government partner <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/blackrock-rules-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rolled into one</a>.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Yet mainstream media treats the company as just another Wall Street financial firm.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">There is a seamless interface that ties the UN Agenda 2030 with the Davos World Economic Forum Great Reset and the nascent economic policies of the Biden Administration. That interface is BlackRock. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Team Biden and BlackRock</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">By now it should be clear to anyone who bothers to look, that the person who claims to be US President, 78-year old Joe Biden, is not making any decisions. He even has difficulty reading a teleprompter or answering prepared questions from friendly media without confusing Syria and Libya or even whether he is President. He is being micromanaged by a group of handlers to maintain a scripted “image” of a President while policy is made behind the scenes by others. It eerily reminds of the 1979 Peter Sellers film character, Chauncey Gardiner, in </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Being There</span><span lang=\"en-US\">. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">What is less public are the key policy persons running economic policy for Biden Inc. They are simply said, BlackRock. Much as Goldman Sachs ran economic policy under Obama and also Trump, today BlackRock is filling that key role. The deal apparently was sealed in January, 2019 when Joe Biden, then-candidate and long-shot chance to defeat Trump, went to meet with Larry Fink in New York, who reportedly told “working class Joe,” that, “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/middle-class-joe-biden-courts-wall-street-oligarch-blackrocks-larry-fink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I’m here to help</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Now as President in one of his first appointees, Biden named Brian Deese to be the Director of the National Economic Council, the President’s main adviser for economic policy. One of the early Presidential Executive Orders dealt with economics and climate policy. That’s not surprising, as Deese came from Fink’s BlackRock where he was Global Head of Sustainable Investing. Before joining BlackRock, Deese held senior economic posts under Obama, including replacing John Podesta as Senior Adviser to the President where he worked alongside Valerie Jarrett. Under Obama, Deese played a key role in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marketrealist.com/p/wally-adeyemo-blackrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negotiating</a> the Global Warming Paris Accords.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In the key policy post as Deputy Treasury Secretary under Secretary Janet Yellen, we find Nigerian-born Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo. Adeyemo also comes from BlackRock where from 2017 to 2019 he was a senior adviser and Chief of Staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, after leaving the Obama Administration. His <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marketrealist.com/p/wally-adeyemo-blackrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal ties</a> to Obama are strong, as Obama named him the first President of the Obama Foundation in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">And a third senior BlackRock person running economic policy in the Administration now is also unusual in several respects. Michael Pyle is the Senior Economic Adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. He came to Washington from the position as the Global Chief Investment Strategist at BlackRock where he oversaw the strategy for investing some $9 trillion of funds. Before joining BlackRock at the highest level, he had also been in the Obama Administration as a senior adviser to the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and in 2015 <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://prospect.org/cabinet-watch/another-blackrock-veteran-will-join-biden-administration-michael-pyle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">became an adviser</a> to the Hillary Clinton presidential bid.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The fact that three of the most influential economic appointees of the Biden Administration come from BlackRock, and before that all from the Obama Administration, is noteworthy. There is a definite pattern and suggests that the role of BlackRock in Washington is far larger than we are being told.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What is BlackRock?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Never before has a financial company with so much influence over world markets been so hidden from public scrutiny. That’s no accident. As it is technically not a bank making bank loans or taking deposits, it evades the regulation oversight from the Federal Reserve even though it does what most mega banks like HSBC or JP MorganChase do—buy, sell securities for profit. When there was a Congressional push to include asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard Funds under the post-2008 Dodd-Frank law as “systemically important financial institutions” or SIFIs, a huge lobbying push from BlackRock ended the threat. BlackRock is essentially a law onto itself. And indeed it is “systemically important” as no other, with possible exception of Vanguard, which is said to also be a major shareholder in BlackRock.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink is clearly interested in buying influence globally. He made former German CDU MP Friederich Merz head of BlackRock Germany when it looked as if he might succeed Chancellor Merkel, and former British Chancellor of Exchequer George Osborne as “political consultant.” Fink named former Hillary Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills to the BlackRock board when it seemed certain Hillary would soon be in the White House. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">He has named former central bankers to his board and gone on to secure lucrative contracts with their former institutions. Stanley Fisher, former head of the Bank of Israel and also later Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve is now Senior Adviser at BlackRock.

As “thank you,” the Fed chairman Jerome Powell named BlackRock in a no-bid role to manage all of the Fed’s corporate bond purchase programs, including bonds where BlackRock itself invests. Conflict of interest? A group of some 30 NGOs wrote to Fed Chairman Powell, “By giving BlackRock full control of this debt buyout program, the Fed… makes BlackRock even more systemically important to the financial system. Yet BlackRock is not subject to the regulatory scrutiny of even smaller systemically <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/06/blackrock-authored-the-bailout-plan-before-there-was-a-crisis-now-its-been-hired-by-three-central-banks-to-implement-the-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">important financial institutions</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In a detailed report in 2019, a Washington non-profit research group, Campaign for Accountability, noted that, “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, implemented a strategy of lobbying, campaign contributions, and revolving door hires to fight off government regulation and establish itself as one of the most powerful <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/new-report-details-how-blackrock-fought-off-government-regulation-by-spending-big-in-washington/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial companies</a> in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The New York Fed hired BlackRock in March 2019 to manage its commercial mortgage-backed securities program and its $750 billion primary and secondary purchases of corporate bonds and ETFs in no-bid contracts. US financial journalists Pam and Russ Martens in critiquing that murky 2019 Fed bailout of Wall Street remarked, “for the first time in history, the Fed has hired BlackRock to “go direct” and buy up $750 billion in both primary and secondary corporate bonds and bond ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), a product of which BlackRock is one of the largest purveyors in the world.” They went on, “Adding further outrage, the BlackRock-run program will get $75 billion of the $454 billion in taxpayers’ money to eat the losses on its corporate bond purchases, which will include its own ETFs, which the Fed is allowing it to buy…”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Fed head Jerome Powell and Larry Fink know each other well, apparently. Even after Powell gave BlackRock the hugely lucrative no-bid “go direct” deal, Powell continued to have the same BlackRock manage an estimated $25 million of Powell’s private securities investments. Public records show that in this time Powell held direct confidential phone calls with BlackRock CEO Fink.

No conflict of interest, or?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">A Very BlackRock in Mexico </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock’s murky history in Mexico shows that conflicts of interest and influence-building with leading government agencies is not restricted to just the USA. PRI Presidential candidate Peña Nieto went to Wall Street during his campaign in November 2011. There he met Larry Fink. What followed the Nieto victory in 2012 was a tight relationship between Fink and Nieto that was riddled with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/new-report-details-how-blackrock-built-its-mexican-infrastructure-business-through-cronyism-corruption-and-conflicts-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conflict of interest</a>, cronyism and corruption.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Most likely to be certain BlackRock was on the winning side in the corrupt new Nieto regime, Fink named 52-year-old Marcos Antonio Slim Domit, billionaire son of Mexico’s wealthiest and arguably most corrupt man, Carlos Slim, to BlackRock’s Board. Marcos Antonio, along with his brother Carlos Slim Domit, run the father’s huge business empire today. Carlos Slim Domit, the eldest son, was Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum Latin America in 2015, and currently serves as chairman of the board of America Movil where BlackRock is a major investor. Small cozy world. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The father, Carlos Slim, at the time named by Forbes as World’s Richest Person, built an empire based around his sweetheart acquisition of Telemex (later America Movil). Then President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in effect gifted the telecom empire to Slim in 1989. Salinas later fled Mexico on charges of stealing more than $10 billion from state coffers. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">As with much in Mexico since the 1980s drug money apparently played a huge role with the elder Carlos Slim, father of BlackRock director Marcos Slim. In 2015 WikiLeaks released company internal emails from the private intelligence corporation, Stratfor. Stratfor writes in an April 2011 email, the time BlackRock is establishing its Mexico plans, that a US DEA Special Agent, William F. Dionne confirmed Carlos Slim’s ties to the Mexican drug cartels. Stratfor asks Dionne, “Billy, is the MX (Mexican) billionaire Carlos Slim linked to the narcos?” Dionne replies, “Regarding your <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https%3A//www.telesurenglish.net/opinion/The-Mexican-Billionaire-Even-Ex-Presidents-Fear-Talking-About--20151201-0019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">question</a>, the MX telecommunication billionaire is.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">In a country where 44% of the population lives in poverty you don’t become the world’s richest man in just two decades selling Girl Scout cookies. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Fink and Mexican PPP</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">With Marcos Slim on his BlackRock board and new president Enrique Peña Nieto, Larry Fink’s Mexican partner in Nieto Peña’s $590 billion PublicPrivatePartnership (PPP) alliance, BlackRock, was ready to reap the harvest. To fine-tune his new Mexican operations, Fink named former Mexican Undersecretary of Finance Gerardo Rodriguez Regordosa to direct BlackRock Emerging Market Strategy in 2013. Then in 2016 Peña Nieto appointed Isaac Volin, then head of BlackRock Mexico to be No. 2 at PEMEX where he presided over corruption, scandals and the largest loss in PEMEX history, $38 billion. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Peña Nieto had opened the huge oil state monopoly, PEMEX, to private investors for the first time since nationalization in the 1930s. The first to benefit was Fink’s BlackRock. Within seven months, BlackRock had secured $1 billion in PEMEX energy projects, many as the only bidder. During the tenure of Peña Nieto, one of the most controversial and least popular presidents, BlackRock prospered by the cozy ties. It soon was <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/blackrock-rules-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">engaged</a> in highly profitable (and corrupt) infrastructure projects under Peña Nieto including not only oil and gas pipelines and wells but also including toll roads, hospitals, gas pipelines and even prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Notably, BlackRock’s Mexican “friend” Peña Nieto was also “friends” not only with Carlos Slim but with the head of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, “El Chapo” Guzman. In court testimony in 2019 in New York Alex Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo’s “right-hand man,” testified that just after his election in 2012, Peña Nieto had requested $250 million from the Sinaloa Cartel before settling on $100 million. We <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46872414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can only guess</a> what for.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Larry Fink and WEF Great Reset </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In 2019 Larry Fink joined the Board of the Davos World Economic Forum, the Swiss-based organization that for some 40 years has advanced economic globalization. Fink, who is close to the WEF’s technocrat head, Klaus Schwab, of Great Reset notoriety, now stands positioned to use the huge weight of BlackRock to create what is potentially, if it doesn’t collapse before, the world’s largest Ponzi scam, ESG corporate investing. Fink with $9 trillion to leverage is pushing the greatest shift of capital in history into a scam known as ESG Investing. The UN “sustainable economy” agenda is being realized quietly by the very same global banks which have created the financial crises in 2008. This time they are preparing the Klaus Schwab WEF Great Reset by steering hundreds of billions and soon trillions in investment to their hand-picked “woke” companies, and away from the “not woke” such as oil and gas companies or coal. BlackRock since 2018 has been in the forefront to create a new investment infrastructure that picks “winners” or “losers” for investment according to how serious that company is about ESG—Environment, Social values and Governance.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">For example a company gets positive ratings for the seriousness of its hiring gender diverse management and employees, or takes measures to eliminate their carbon “footprint” by making their energy sources green or sustainable to use the UN term. How corporations contribute to a global sustainable governance is the most vague of the ESG, and could include anything from corporate donations to Black Lives Matter to supporting UN agencies such as WHO. Oil companies like ExxonMobil or coal companies no matter how clear are doomed as Fink and friends now promote their financial Great Reset or Green New Deal. This is why he cut a deal with the Biden presidency in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Follow the money. And we can expect that the New York Times will cheer BlackRock on as it destroys the world financial structures. Since 2017 BlackRock has been the paper’s largest shareholder. Carlos Slim was second largest. Even Carl Icahn, a ruthless Wall Street asset stripper, once <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https%3A//wallstreetonparade.com/2020/03/icahn-called-blackrock-an-extremely-dangerous-company-the-fed-has-chosen-it-to-manage-its-corporate-bond-bailout-programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called</a> BlackRock, “an extremely dangerous company… I used to say, you know, the mafia has a better code of ethics than you guys.” </span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The theme was echoed by <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> who cited the income guarantee that is offered by countries like Denmark and Finland as a possible model for future development.</em></p>\n<p><em>Both Yang and Sanders argued that automation of production and other technological changes taking place in America have created a lag in job creation even as the economy flourishes, and that such a state can be responded to best with a universal basic income.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are advantages and disadvantages to a basic income that demand a thoughtful debate among citizens, in the media and in the halls of government. Such a debate is absolutely impossible in the current environment of oppression.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What we have now is a universal basic income being forced upon us without any democratic due process or accountability. It is known as the “corona virus stimulus check.”</strong> The newspapers tell us that we may get another $1,200 in the mail soon if congress passes a bill.</p>\n<p>So let us step back and think about this check for $1,200 that the government offers us. <strong>For many of us, the current shutdown has ended our economic lives, left us unemployed. The stimulus check is the only form of payment we receive. It is our de facto “universal basic income” –like it or not.</strong> But does this universal basic income allow us to be creative artists, to volunteer in our neighborhoods, to have the financial security that will allow us to fully realize ourselves?</p>\n<p>No, sadly, this universal basic income has been imposed upon us from above. Who knows who made up the idea. Certainly no one asked our opinions. We have no say in how much it is for, or who gets it. One thing is certain: for most of us, it is not anywhere near enough.</p>\n<p>Also, the debate on the universal basic income assumes that income is the critical issue for Americans. No serious economist believes this fraud. The primary issue in the United States is assets, ownership. And assets are dominated by a tiny handful of the rich.</p>\n<p><strong>The over-the-top response to COVID-19 has shut down the United States economy and led to massive unemployment in the course of just a few months.</strong> This pre-planned controlled demolition of the economy has left us begging for a universal basic income and we are getting it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, billionaires are getting billions of dollars in subsidies, as are CEOs. They do not need a universal basic income because they make their money off of speculation, off of the money they print up, off of what they take from us. COVID-19 is about a massive transfer of wealth and unless that transfer is stopped, basic income will be of little help.</p>\n<p><strong>Most of us are facing eviction, our small stores are being shut down by arbitrary regulations on our free movement, and no small number of us face starvation and homelessness in the next few months unless action is taken now.</strong></p>\n<p>Giving us a basic income without addressing the massive concentration of wealth, which has grown exponentially worse over just the last five months, is a recipe for disaster. Doing so after creating an environment in which we have no choice but to accept those checks is criminal.</p>\n<p>The super-rich have spent the last twelve years, and especially the last three months, printing up money through the Federal Reserve and giving it back to themselves. If we do not take that money back, economic inequality cannot be countered.</p>\n<p>Between five and ten trillion dollars disappeared while you were distracted. If we leave the artificially created economic disparity in the United States untouched, if we let the looters at the top keep their loot, the free money from the government will not be free. It will be paid for with your taxes (certainly not taxes on multinational corporations with their headquarters offshore) or it will raise the national debt and eat away at your buying power.</p>\n<p>We cannot grow our own food, we cannot produce our own energy, and we cannot create our own clothes, furniture, and other products for daily life. We can only use the money that we are paid by corporations to purchase products at big stores run by multinational corporations, offering products produced overseas by poorly paid workers.</p>\n<p>The government has become the toy of the rich and powerful. High government officials, judges and even middle-level officials are appointed with the backing of multinational corporations and investment banks. The politicians are even worse.</p>\n<p>The actual experts in government have been removed and government functions, which are essential, have been outsourced to private corporations who do today what the government did, but with a focus on short-term profits, and not on the people. These companies are paid with your tax dollars to do the job of government, but they never swore and oath to the constitution, and their primary mission is delivering profits to their owners.</p>\n<p>The redistribution of assets, the complete transparency of the government and the complete end to the unwarranted and dangerous influence of the wealthy, and of the banks and corporations that they control, over the formulation of policy must come before we can start to discuss basic income.</p>\n<p>We need to consider why the banks want to cultivate in us habits of dependency and passivity. After all, if all we can do is sit around watching TV until our stimulus check comes, we will be unable to organize ourselves into groups capable of taking action, we will be unable to build our own economies.</p>\n<p>Let us talk for a moment about the relationship between technology and the proposed universal basic income. The argument advanced by Yang and Sanders was that automation, and the growth of AI and other technologies, are reducing jobs because they are not being formed in other sectors even as productivity increases. Therefore, we need a UBI to assure that workers displaced by new technologies have employment and can adapt to a new work reality.</p>\n<p>It is assumed that, just as the sun rises in the East, automation, the implementation of AI and the end of human to human interactions is a natural law that cannot be violated, that is beyond the realm of policy discussion.</p>\n<p>But are we truly forced to tear apart the natural order of society in order to satiate the cruel god of technology demanding endless sacrifice for the sake of an inevitable fourth industrial revolution, for the sake of the inevitable domination of the Earth by automation, driver-less cars, robots and drones? Is the internet of things truly the Kingdom Come?</p>\n<p>Is the promotion of AI (artificial intelligence) in accord with God’s covenant with man? Or is it rather a scheme to increase profits for the few, and drive the common man, the common woman, into poverty and dependency?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question is not obvious. It demands an open discussion involving experts on society, on technology, on governance and on economics, but also ordinary citizens who understand better than anyone else what the impact of technology can be. Moreover, the discussion should be transparent and scientific in nature, leaving no space for the wealthy who benefit from automation and AI to disguise their wish list as scientific truth.</p>\n<p>Productivity without job growth is the standard line used to justify this basic income. Productivity is the holy cow that cannot be approached by any but the anointed high priests, a false concept cooked up to justify just about anything. It is not the law of gravity or the second law of thermodynamics. It is the biased and warped idea that holds that certain forms of economic activity to be more important than others.</p>\n<p>If you spend the day helping your sick mother, tending vegetables in the community farm, volunteering with the handicapped, or playing with your children, that activity is not considered productive by those who make up the rules of productivity.</p>\n<p>But if you destroy forests or farmland to build unnecessary shopping malls, if you poison rivers and lakes with the run off from factory farms, or from uranium mines, or if you wage wars abroad, that is consider productivity. The gap between employment and productivity is most certainly not simply a result of technological change.</p>\n<p>Finally, we need to consider where the United States stands in history at this moment, and where we have come from, before we can talk about where we are going.</p>\n<p>In the previous generation there was a profound ideological and economic competition between the market economies of the United States and Europe and the socialist economies of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. We refer to it, imprecisely, as the Cold War.</p>\n<p>The United States held up the ideal that there was no limit to what the individual could achieve through his or her efforts and we argued that individual freedoms were more critical than the common good.</p>\n<p>The socialist economies assumed that economic equality was central for a healthy society and took preemptive measures to assure a relatively egalitarian economy.</p>\n<p>I grew up in the United States. We assumed that we could have economic fairness and at the same time the ability obtain rewards in accord to our special efforts in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>But, what we assumed to be a natural state was not at all natural. The massive accumulation of wealth, the exploitation of workers, and the abuse of child labor were standard practice in the late nineteenth century, and even into the 1930s.</p>\n<p>But the existence of the socialist block out there, imperfect though it was, put unending pressure on the United States to modify the system and to allow for a more just society — granted there were profound limits.</p>\n<p>In the late 1930s, the threat of revolution within the United States also was real and it forced action on labor issues that would otherwise have been ignored.</p>\n<p>We may not have been aware of that pressure, but it made things like welfare and the minimum wage possible.</p>\n<p>The salaries of CEOs were capped. Taxes on the rich went up to 90% and there were no billionaires, or offshore tax havens. America was not that way because the rich were virtuous. It was that way because there was endless pressure.</p>\n<p>When the so-called “communist block” was subject to commercialization from the 1990s on, and the ideological opposition dropped off, the United States slowly shifted back to the ruthless market economy it had once enjoyed, one in which workers were expendable. This time, however, automation and drones, AI and robots, made it possible to engage in an even more ruthless experiment.</p>\n<p>But the shifts in American society, like climate change, were too slow for us to grasp. We were too caught up with email and Facebook to notice.</p>\n<p>We could not perceive that the rules we had accepted had disappeared, that a ruthless shiny brave new world had been born.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we cannot discuss a universal basic income in the United States until we start to create a culture, a system, in which some counter force exists to stand up for the interests of ordinary citizens. That is the ultimate question. That counter force, however, must be built by you, by me and by us, and not by experts or by politicians and most certainly not by corporations with their drones and robots.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
