All in all, the average American buys 250 percent more drugs every year compared to the average non-American. (Related: America is the most expensive place for healthcare but is <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/039143_healthcare_spending_USA_life_expectancy.html\" target=\"_blank\">dead last</a> as far as life expectancy goes.)</p>\n<p>Conversely, Mexico and Costa Rica are at the bottom of the OCED list for pharmaceutical spending, along with several Eastern European and Nordic countries.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of America&#8217;s drug habit is spent on prescription drugs that require a doctor &#8220;dealer&#8221; to prescribe. A much smaller percentage of drug spending goes towards over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Despite having significantly different overall expenditure levels, English-speaking countries on the list, such as the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the UK, all had above-average spending on over-the-counter medications in common,&#8221; reports <i>Great Game India</i>.</p>\n<h2>Most of Big Pharma&#8217;s profits are laundered through government-mandated insurance</h2>\n<p>Only a fraction of pharmaceutical spending in the United States and other OECD countries is out of pocket. On average across all members, 55 percent of total pharmaceutical spending is routed through health insurance, which in many of the countries is mandated.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>In Germany and France, both socialist nations, upwards of 80 percent of pharmaceutical spending occurs via insurance and / or the government. In the U.S., the figure hovers closer to 70 percent.</p>\n<p>Out-of-pocket pharmaceutical spending across Eastern Europe and Scandinavia is roughly 50 percent, while in Costa Rica it is as high as 97 percent, according to the latest figures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As for medical goods and services in general, the U.S. is among the countries with highest health costs worldwide,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266141/pharmaceutical-spending-per-capita-in-selected-countries/\" target=\"_blank\">reports <i>Statista</i></a>, which compiled the data. &#8220;The higher costs in the United States are particularly obvious when compared to other high-income, developed countries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to <i>Statista</i>, nearly half of all Americans are taking at least one pharmaceutical prescription at any given time. And the vast majority of pharmaceutical drug users are women – though the gap is narrowing.</p>\n<p>The most common types of drugs used and abused by Americans include antidiabetics – because the Standard American Diet (SAD) is a recipe for diabetes and early death – oncologics, autoimmune disorders and respiratory diseases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand, antihypertensives, pain relievers, and mental health drugs are the leading classes based on number of prescriptions filled,&#8221; <i>Statista</i> says.</p>\n<p>Clearly, America is <i>not</i> a healthy nation. Many people are sick, overweight, disturbed and <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/rev/18/1/s_1185001\" target=\"_blank\">addicted to <i>pharmakeia</i></a>, which the Bible says is a form of <i>witchcraft</i>.</p>\n<p>Big Pharma&#8217;s witches&#8217; brews have become an American pastime, in other words, as evidenced by the nation&#8217;s pharmaceutical spending habits. A nation of disease and death is what the U.S. has become, along with every other nation that partakes of and profits from its pharmaceutical sorceries.</p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical drugs will never provide true healing, and in many cases result in a <i>worsening</i> of one&#8217;s health condition(s). Your best bet is to stick with herbs and nature; steer clear of synthetic chemicals – including pharmaceuticals; and eat organic, nutrient-dense foods to help balance both body and mind.</p>\n<p>The latest news about Big Pharma and America&#8217;s pharmaceutical drug addiction problem can be found at <a href=\"http://drugcartels.news\" target=\"_blank\">DrugCartels.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://greatgameindia.com/countries-spending-pharmaceuticals/\" target=\"_blank\">GreatGameIndia.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/039143_healthcare_spending_USA_life_expectancy.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266141/pharmaceutical-spending-per-capita-in-selected-countries/\" target=\"_blank\">Statista.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-drug-addicted-americans-spend-more-on-pharmaceuticals-drugs.html\" data-a2a-title=\"LAND OF THE DRUG ADDICTED: Americans spend more money on pharmaceuticals than anyone else in the world\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-drug-addicted-americans-spend-more-on-pharmaceuticals-drugs.html&linkname=LAND%20OF%20THE%20DRUG%20ADDICTED%3A%20Americans%20spend%20more%20money%20on%20pharmaceuticals%20than%20anyone%20else%20in%20the%20world\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-drug-addicted-americans-spend-more-on-pharmaceuticals-drugs.html&linkname=LAND%20OF%20THE%20DRUG%20ADDICTED%3A%20Americans%20spend%20more%20money%20on%20pharmaceuticals%20than%20anyone%20else%20in%20the%20world\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-drug-addicted-americans-spend-more-on-pharmaceuticals-drugs.html&linkname=LAND%20OF%20THE%20DRUG%20ADDICTED%3A%20Americans%20spend%20more%20money%20on%20pharmaceuticals%20than%20anyone%20else%20in%20the%20world\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-drug-addicted-americans-spend-more-on-pharmaceuticals-drugs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-16 12:35:13', '82', '', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '2032-08-13 19:28:33', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '18', '', '', '1', '1', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

The product, which comes from Canada, is labeled using the terms &#8220;nutritious,&#8221; &#8220;sustainable,&#8221; and &#8220;delicious.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Cheddar Cheese Puffs product from Actually Foods is also branded as being high in protein because it is &#8220;powered by crickets&#8221; – the suggestion being that crickets are a &#8220;superfood.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It turns out that Entomo Farms, the parent company of Actually Foods, is on a mission &#8220;to make cricket-based foods the first choice for individuals interested in high-quality, sustainable protein.&#8221; The company offers an entire line of products with cricket ingredients, including cricket protein powder and whole roasted crickets, both in regular and &#8220;organic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Exo Protein&#8217;s Savory Meal Bar is another food product that contains cricket flour as a protein source. Competitor Snowpiercer likewise offers a &#8220;cricket protein bar&#8221; that is marketed as a health food product.</p>\n<h2>Globalists will gorge on meat while their human slaves are forced to eat bugs</h2>\n<p>Another creepy brand called Human Improvement (hi!), the branding of which is reminiscent of the film <i>Soylent Green</i>, offers a cricket protein powder that contains &#8220;crazy fiber&#8221; and other &#8220;unique ingredients.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The company claims that its insect powder is an &#8220;actual whole food&#8221; that is great &#8220;for muscle&#8221; and does not cause bloat. It aims to be a replacement for whey protein from goats and cows.</p>\n<p>Then we have Hoppy Planet Foods&#8217; &#8220;Chocolate Chirp Cookies,&#8221; which are labeled on the front of the package as containing &#8220;3x protein&#8221; compared to regular chocolate chip cookies.</p>\n<p>What is not apparent from the front of the package is the fact that Chocolate Chirp Cookies contain cricket ingredients that are not prominent upon first glance. This is one of the more deceptive brands that appears to be trying to hide cricket ingredients from customers.</p>\n<p>Roberts Bakery in the United Kingdom also offers a cricket bread loaf that contains dried, ground-up cricket carcasses in the flour. The result is &#8220;a lovely tasty loaf with a crunchy finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-07-wales-feeding-schoolchildren-mealworms-crickets-great-reset.html\" target=\"_blank\">we reported</a>, crickets are also now on the menu at some public schools in Wales, another country that has been co-opted by globalists from the World Economic Forum (WEF), which is behind the cricket push.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The world’s population will reach 9.7 billion people by 2050. This means that despite only 4% of arable land remaining available on the surface of our planet an additional 2 billion more humans will have to be fed,&#8221; the WEF wrote in an article published last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order to address this impending crisis, world experts and leaders will meet this autumn at the UN Food Summit and then the COP26. Often overlooked in these discussions is the potential role insects can play in helping meet this challenge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Self-appointed elitists like WEF head Klaus Schwab would never stoop so low themselves as to consume crickets and other insects. No, those are for the peons – the human slaves whom the globalists see as cattle, hence the push for the masses to eat bugs.</p>\n<p>All the talk about bugs being &#8220;carbon-friendly&#8221; is climate-deranged nonsense and deception to corral the human herd into a &#8220;sustainable,&#8221; meat-free future. The question is: will you let the globalists do this to you without a fight?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now there&#8217;s some food factories we won&#8217;t see any fires at,&#8221; wrote a commenter at <i>Infowars</i> about how the cricket factories are safe from the globalists&#8217; terrorism spree.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the &#8220;green&#8221; push away from meat and into crickets and other insects, visit <a href=\"http://Frankenfood.news\" target=\"_blank\">Frankenfood.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/posts/you-will-eat-the-bugs-major-brands-quietly-slipping-insects-into-your-food/\" target=\"_blank\">Infowars.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-07-wales-feeding-schoolchildren-mealworms-crickets-great-reset.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-food-corporations-quietly-adding-crickets-insects-food.html\" data-a2a-title=\"What’s that smell?

This includes cash for a cadre of 200 “special agents” that engage in SWAT-style ops.</em></p>\n<p>“We were shocked ourselves to find these kinds of pervasive expenditures at an agency that is supposed to be involved in clean air and clean water,” said Open the Books’ founder, Adam Andrzejewski, a former gubernatorial candidate in Illinois. “Some of these weapons are for full-scale military operations.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, some of the military-style ops carried out by EPA teams had already been reported in the media. Two years earlier, an EPA team conducted an armed raid in a small Alaska town where miners had been accused of polluting some local waters. Fox News noted then that the EPA&#8217;s &#8220;armed agents in full body armor&#8221; took part in the raid.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The EPA’s website at the time described the mission and activities of its criminal enforcement division as “investigating cases, collecting evidence, conducting forensic analyses and providing legal guidance to assist in the prosecution of criminal conduct that threatens people’s health and the environment.”</p>\n<p><i>The Spectator</i> added then that Obama was not completely to blame, noting that the agency first obtained police powers in 1988, at the close of the Reagan administration. But by the time of the outlet&#8217;s report, EPA was engaged in what a separate media outlet described as “environmental crime-fighting.”</p>\n<p>“For more than 30 years, there has been broad, bipartisan agreement about the importance of an armed, fully-equipped team of EPA agents working with state and federal partners to uphold the law and protect Americans,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s website said then.</p>\n<p>But Open the Books found more. For instance, supporting the armed EPA SWAT-style teams is a legion of highly paid attorneys and other staffers.</p>\n<p>The whistleblower group found that seven of 10 EPA workers earn in excess of $100,000 (again, in 2015) while the agency&#8217;s then-$8 billion budget also financed the salaries of 1,000 lawyers, making the agency one of the country&#8217;s largest law firms.</p>\n<p><i>The Specator</i> noted further:</p>\n<p><em>The EPA is hardly going solo in this armed adventure against America, however. The agency has collaborated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and a recent report by the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that more than 40 federal agencies, with 100,000 officers, carry guns and make arrests.</em></p>\n<p>As for the EPA&#8217;s authority, the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s Trump-imposed conservative majority gave Americans some respite in its latest session, which ended in June.</p>\n<p>The court&#8217;s 6-justice conservative majority dramatically curbed the agency&#8217;s power.</p>\n<p>The ruling stated &#8220;that the Environmental Protection Agency cannot put state-level caps on carbon emissions under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Such authority would, in effect, steer states away from coal and toward other types of power sources that emit less carbon,&#8221; Harvard University&#8217;s School of Public Health noted in an online assessment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Court said that, instead, the authority to decide how power is created in the U.S. must come from Congress,&#8221; the explainer added.</p>\n<p>Anytime <a href=\"http://www.biggovernment.news\">a federal agency loses power</a>, that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/the-supreme-court-curbed-epas-power-to-regulate-carbon-emissions-from-power-plants-what-comes-next/\">HSPH.Harvard.edu</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://spectator.org/64333_armed-epa-agents-truth-way-out-there/\">Spectator.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Not the first time: Democrat weaponization of IRS follows historic path of regime militarizing other federal agencies including the EPA\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html&linkname=Not%20the%20first%20time%3A%20Democrat%20weaponization%20of%20IRS%20follows%20historic%20path%20of%20regime%20militarizing%20other%20federal%20agencies%20including%20the%20EPA\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html&linkname=Not%20the%20first%20time%3A%20Democrat%20weaponization%20of%20IRS%20follows%20historic%20path%20of%20regime%20militarizing%20other%20federal%20agencies%20including%20the%20EPA\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html&linkname=Not%20the%20first%20time%3A%20Democrat%20weaponization%20of%20IRS%20follows%20historic%20path%20of%20regime%20militarizing%20other%20federal%20agencies%20including%20the%20EPA\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-16 12:21:14', '82', '', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '2032-08-13 19:28:33', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '16', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Not a single word about it. Come to find out, this was blatant misinformation. In fact, this is the premise of all the highly toxic COVID-19 so-called &#8220;vaccines&#8221; and the truth is out. The nanoparticles are known to get distributed THROUGHOUT the entire body, and according to research from <a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/what-ive-seen-in-the-last-two-years-is-unprecedented-physician-on-covid-vaccine-side-effects-on-pregnant-women_4428291.html\">two in-depth studies</a>, for women, those lipid nanoparticles (cargo of the messenger RNA) concentrate in the ovaries. This all happens within 48 hours, according to unveiled documents and scientific research.</p>\n<p>Once internal documents like these are revealed, usually thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, pharma gurus and regulatory agency heads often &#8220;come out of the closet&#8221; and admit at least some of the truth to the public. Now we know. All of the human organs, including vital cleansing organs and reproductive organs, are exposed to toxic substances that can have catastrophic effects on function and fertility. These <a href=\"http://vital organs,\">toxic particles stick</a> to adrenal glands and vital organs, including the spleen, ovaries, liver and more.</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise to those well-aware of the pharmaceutical industrial complex&#8217;s long history of corruption and scandals that they knew of this unequivocal science-based evidence before the &#8220;vaccines&#8221; were ever administered to the populace.</p>\n<h2><strong>During clinical trials, severe adverse effects and deaths mounted to nearly 50% for pregnant women who received these toxic nanoparticle jabs</strong></h2>\n<p>&#8220;A high local accumulation of nanoparticles, nanocapsules and nanoemulsions in specific locations of the ovaries was found in all animals,&#8221; read the report that the pharmaceutical industry buried. They all knew for years that the mRNA injections and the protein payload injections leave the injection site and spread throughout the entire body using the vascular system as its roadways and spike protein &#8220;technology&#8221; as the Trojan horse to enter cells and change human DNA forever.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Wake up and smell the nanoparticles. Obviously, these sticky spike protein nanoparticles, also known as prions, can cause myocarditis, pericarditis, strokes, cancer and abortions. In other words, the COVID-19 vaccines are population reduction mechanisms and part of a secret biomedical terrorism campaign waged around the world. It&#8217;s no conspiracy theory when the proof comes out from internal documents that completely counter the narrative LIE we&#8217;ve all heard over and over.</p>\n<p>This is Pandora&#8217;s box. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we KNOW 100 percent for sure that the spike protein toxins leave the injection site and spread throughout the body, harming all vital systems, we also know about many other avenues of misinformation spread by the FDA, CDC, Fauci, Walensky and other pharma shills and charlatans.</p>\n<h2><strong>Top 8 ADMISSIONS of GUILT by the CDC, FDA, Fauci, and top immunologists about COVID-19 vaccine dangers</strong></h2>\n<p>#1. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admitted the vaccines &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.stardem.com/news/national/cdc-covid-vaccines-won-t-stop-transmission-fully-vaccinated-can-still-get-spread-delta-strain/article_5f83d0cb-8b0a-535d-bbad-3f571754e5ae.html\">will not stop transmission</a> of the virus&#8221; (August 2021)</p>\n<p>#2. Fauci admits vaccines do NOT protect against infection: “I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection and I think we overplayed the vaccines&#8221;</p>\n<p>#3. Fauci admits the jabs DO cause <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/doctors-criticize-fauci-saying-covid-vaccines-induce-temporary-menstrual-irregularities\">menstrual irregularities</a>, including major adverse effects for women of reproductive age</p>\n<p>#4. SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) was created in a Wuhan lab</p>\n<p>#5. &#8220;<a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-05-congress-not-allowed-to-know-secret-research.html\">Gain of function</a>&#8221; research on bat viruses was (partially) funded by Fauci and kept secret for years</p>\n<p>#6. SARS-CoV-2 virus has NEVER been<a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-11-covid-does-not-exist-novel-isolated-virus.html\"> isolated or purified </a>to confirm the actual virus&#8217;s existence</p>\n<p>#7. FDA makes J&amp;J include <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-05-13-fda-add-blood-clot-warning-jnj-vaccine.html\">blood clot risk warning</a> on their single-dose COVID-19 jabs after CDC lifts suspension</p>\n<p>#8. Fauci and Biden catch COVID after being triple and quadruple vaxxed against it</p>\n<p>So there you have it. The truth comes out thanks to truth media and the Freedom of Information Act.

Epstein wound up serving just 13 months in county jail and was granted work release,&#8221; The Post reported.</p>\n<p>According to court documents cited by the Herald, Reinhart left the South Florida U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office effective New Year&#8217;s Day 2008 and wound up working for Epstein&#8217;s associates the next day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ten months after starting work for Epstein’s co-conspirators, according to Federal Election Commission records, Reinhart gave $1,000 directly to the Obama campaign and another $1,000 to its fundraising arm, the Obama Victory Fund,&#8221; The Post added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Though the records show the judge made mostly small-dollar donations to his law firm’s political action committee in subsequent years, Reinhart also donated $500 to Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign in November 2015,&#8221; the outlet continued.</p>\n<p>Reinhart’s central role in <a href=\"http://www.trump.news\">issuing Trump’s warrant</a> was blasted by critics who saw obvious conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>“Not only did Reinhart make an ethically questionable move from prosecuting Epstein and his accomplices to representing them, but <a href=\"https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Bruce+Reinhart&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to FEC records</a>, Reinhart donated $1,000 to Barack Obama’s presidential campaign and another $1,000 to a pro-Obama PAC in 2008,” <a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/federal-13-65358/\"><em>PJ Media</em>’s Matt Margolis noted</a>.</p>\n<p>“So, aside from the blatant abuse of power by the Biden administration, an Epstein-linked Obama donor approved the warrant authorizing the raid on Trump’s home,” he added.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/posts/judge-who-signed-off-on-fbi-raid-made-anti-trump-posts/\">Infowars.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/federal-13-65358/\">ConservativeBrief.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-judge-signed-warrant-fbi-search-trumps-home-woke-libtard.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Judge who signed warrant to allow FBI to search Trump’s home a “woke” leftist who hates the real president\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-judge-signed-warrant-fbi-search-trumps-home-woke-libtard.html&linkname=Judge%20who%20signed%20warrant%20to%20allow%20FBI%20to%20search%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20home%20a%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20leftist%20who%20hates%20the%20real%20president\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-judge-signed-warrant-fbi-search-trumps-home-woke-libtard.html&linkname=Judge%20who%20signed%20warrant%20to%20allow%20FBI%20to%20search%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20home%20a%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20leftist%20who%20hates%20the%20real%20president\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-judge-signed-warrant-fbi-search-trumps-home-woke-libtard.html&linkname=Judge%20who%20signed%20warrant%20to%20allow%20FBI%20to%20search%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20home%20a%20%E2%80%9Cwoke%E2%80%9D%20leftist%20who%20hates%20the%20real%20president\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-judge-signed-warrant-fbi-search-trumps-home-woke-libtard.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-16 12:15:00', '82', '', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '2032-08-13 19:28:33', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '14', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Meanwhile, governments are still pushing the shots as the &#8220;cure&#8221; for Chinese Germs.</p>\n<p>The United Kingdom Health Security Agency&#8217;s (UKHSA) &#8220;Ambulance Syndromic Surveillance System – Week 30&#8221; bulletin offers a glimpse into the carnage using Great Britain as the example. There, emergency ambulance calls are through the roof due to post-injection &#8220;complications,&#8221; and the health care system is now on the verge of collapsing.</p>\n<p>Since at least last August when Operation Warp Speed was in full swing, the number of emergency calls for potentially life-threatening heart issues has nearly doubled – and that number is only increasing with each passing day. (Related: Pfizer has <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-15-pfizer-documents-data-covid-jabs-mass-depopulation.html\" target=\"_blank\">known this entire time</a> that its covid injections are killing people.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; ambulance call-outs for high conditions have been overall since January 2021, and have been increasing month to month,&#8221; reports <i>Exposé News</i>. &#8220;It was not until April 2021 that we saw a significant increase among people under the age of 30 though, and it again has increased month on month since then.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>CDC says myocarditis risk post-mRNA injection is 133 times greater than background risk for general population</h2>\n<p>In the under-30 category, the number of call-outs per year, on average, between 2017 and 2020 prior to when the shots were released was 24,463.

Other complications of the condition include sudden cardiac death.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no mild version of myocarditis, it is extremely serious due to the fact that the heart muscle is incapable of regenerating.

For over a year, the CDC contended that the mRNA quickly degrades in the body after it is injected. They also claimed that the translated spike proteins stay in the deltoid muscle, where they are quickly neutralized by immune-responsive cells. These vaccine-encoded spike proteins were heralded as a “safe and effective” immunization, preparing the body to fight SARS-CoV-2. However, the entire process has made <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114228\">vaccinated individuals more susceptible to future strains</a> of the virus. Even worse, the persistence of spike proteins in the blood causes blood clots and inflammation of other organs, especially the heart.</p>\n<h2>CDC silently retracts “settled science” after misleading millions of people</h2>\n<p>Scientists, doctors and researchers who questioned or challenged the CDC’s assertions were blocked across social media and accused of spreading “misinformation.” Many have lost their jobs or had their license threatened. Now, the CDC is silently retracting “settled science” they once demanded the public worship. The CDC quietly altered its website, confessing that the mRNA and the spike proteins persists in the body for an extended duration of time. Also, the CDC finally admitted that there is no logical reason to treat vaccinated people differently than unvaccinated people because both can readily contract and transmit coronavirus variants. Even worse, the vaccine subverts the initial surveillance immune cells, leading to inferior intracellular T-cell response.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The CDC once claimed that “our cells break down mRNA from these vaccines and get rid of it within a few days after vaccination.” Now the CDC says, “Scientists estimate that the spike protein, like other proteins our bodies create, may stay in the body up to a few weeks.” Additionally, the CDC recently removed this statement from their website: “mRNA and the spike protein do not last long in the body.” The vaccine manufacturers drastically underestimated the replication force of the mRNA. The regulatory agencies never fully understood how the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w\">immune responsive cells would react</a> to these foreign proteins.</p>\n<p>Runaway spike protein synthesis has serious implications for human health. If the mRNA does not degrade quickly, it can force human cells to <a href=\"http://spikeprotein.news\">replicate inflammatory spike proteins</a> for a longer duration, causing cardiovascular and organ damage. This would inevitably block the production of natural proteins that the body needs in order to function properly. If the spike proteins are not being properly neutralized by the immune system, they may colonize in distant organs, causing inflammation in unpredictable locations throughout the body.</p>\n<h2>Another CDC lie debunked: COVID vaccines DO negatively affect human DNA</h2>\n<p>Under a tab titled, “Facts About mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines, the CDC also claims that the shots “do not affect or interact with our DNA.” “[The] mRNA from these vaccines do not enter the nucleus of the cell where our DNA (genetic material) is located, so it cannot change or influence our genes,” the CDC contends. However, a study out of Sweden finds evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike enters the nuclei of the cell and impairs the DNA damage repair process. The study, <em>SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro</em>, confirms that the COVID vaccines <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/10/2056/htm\">interfere with human DNA just hours after vaccination</a>. The spike proteins that are translated by the mRNA vaccines were found to enter the nuclei of cells, blocking the cell’s ability to repair damaged DNA.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that the mRNA vaccines impede important DNA repair proteins (BRCA1 and 53BP1). In essence, the COVID vaccines are altering DNA through a molecular mechanism that damages adaptive immunity. Breached cell nuclei could also spell further harms in the long term. “Our study shows that [Pfizer’s mRNA injection] … can be reverse-transcribed to DNA … and this may give rise to concern if BNT162b2-derived DNA may be integrated into the host genome and affect the integrity of genomic DNA, which may potentially mediate genotoxic side effects,” wrote the researchers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdc.news\">The CDC is collapsing</a>, and every lie emanating from the vaccine industry will be exposed.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/08/cdc-quietly-removes-statement-says-mrna-spike-protein-not-last-long-body-website/\">TheGateWayPundit.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114228\">NEJM.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w\">CDC.gov</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/10/2056/htm\">MDPI.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html\" data-a2a-title=\"CDC is quietly altering its website, now admitting that mRNA persists in the body for an extended duration\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html&linkname=CDC%20is%20quietly%20altering%20its%20website%2C%20now%20admitting%20that%20mRNA%20persists%20in%20the%20body%20for%20an%20extended%20duration\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html&linkname=CDC%20is%20quietly%20altering%20its%20website%2C%20now%20admitting%20that%20mRNA%20persists%20in%20the%20body%20for%20an%20extended%20duration\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html&linkname=CDC%20is%20quietly%20altering%20its%20website%2C%20now%20admitting%20that%20mRNA%20persists%20in%20the%20body%20for%20an%20extended%20duration\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-16 08:29:33', '82', '', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-16 19:28:29', '2032-08-13 19:28:33', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '12', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

However, everyone in America was being injected with — <strong>and continue to take — the legally distinct emergency use authorization (EUA) version of the shot.</strong> The FDA approved Comirnaty shot has never become available to the American public in the United States.</p>\n<p>In the months following the initial FDA approval, Pfizer continued to make new excuses for why it was not rolling out the FDA approved version of the mRNA injection. The pharmaceutical company seemed to be playing what amounted to a shell game.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, in June, as reported in The Dossier, Pfizer acknowledged in quiet filings to the CDC that they would never produce the FDA approved version of Comirnaty that was authorized on August 23, 2021.</strong></p>\n<p>The Dossier has the full timeline in our piece, “Ghost Shot,” which you can click below.</p>\n<p>The Dossier has been “fact checked” by the likes of Politifact and USA Today, which falsely claimed that there was indeed an FDA approved vaccine available to the public, when that is absolutely, provably not the case.</p>\n<p>Now, as the one year anniversary for the FDA approval of Comirnaty approaches, we are left with more questions than answers. The Biden Administration, Big Pharma, and Big Tech teamed up to fool Americans into taking a shot that they thought was FDA approved, but it turns out, that shot never actually existed, and will never exist.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

They allege that the agency under Pompeo spied on them in violation of their privacy rights</em>.</p>\n<p>Undercover Global S.L., a private security company in Spain, and the company’s director David Morales are also named as defendants. UC Global ramped up surveillance against Assange and shared audio and video footage from the embassy with “American intelligence.”</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“The United States Constitution shields American citizens from US government overreach even when the activities take place in a foreign embassy in a foreign country. Visitors who are lawyers, journalists and doctors frequently carry confidential information in their devices,” declared Richard Roth, who is the lead attorney representing the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“They had a reasonable expectation that the security guards at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would not be US government spies charged with delivering copies of their electronics to the CIA,” Roth added.</p>\n<p>Two of the plaintiffs are attorneys who have represented Assange—Margaret Rather Kunstler, a civil rights activist and human rights attorney, and Deborah Hrbek, a media lawyer.</p>\n<p>The other two plaintiffs are journalists Charles Glass and John Goetz, who worked for Der Spiegel when the German media organization first partnered with WikiLeaks to publish documents on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit comes around two months after United Kingdom <strong>Home Secretary Priti Patel</strong> <a href=\"https://thedissenter.org/uk-government-approves-assanges-extradition-to-united-states/\">approved</a> the US extradition request against Assange. His legal team has <a href=\"https://thedissenter.org/assange-appeals-extradition-to-united-states/\">submitted</a> two separate appeals in the UK courts, yet it is increasingly evident that Assange could be flown to the US to face Espionage Act charges that civil liberties, human rights, and press freedom organizations around the world have condemned.</p>\n<p>According to the complaint [<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22136105-complaint-cia-pompeo-sued-by-journalists-and-attorneys-who-visited-assange\">PDF</a>] filed in a US court in the Southern District of New York, Glass, Goetz, Hrbek, and Kunstler, like all visitors, were required to “surrender” their electronic devices to UC Global employees hired by Ecuador to provide security for the embassy. What they did not know is that UC Global “copied the information stored on the devices” and allegedly shared the information with the CIA. Pompeo allegedly authorized and approved the action.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Security required plaintiffs to leave their devices with them, which contained “confidential and privileged information about their sources or clients. This information was copied and allegedly shared with the CIA.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that “well over 100 American citizens who visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy” had their privacy rights violated. This includes attorneys who were there to represent Assange, journalists who traveled to interview him, and even doctors who came to the embassy to assess and treat his deteriorating health. Their privileged communications stored on electronic devices were compromised.</p>\n<p>The CIA-backed spying operation began around January 2017 and lasted until UC Global’s contract was terminated around April 2018. By that time, the Justice Department under President Donald Trump already had a sealed indictment against Assange.</p>\n<p>Pompeo allegedly approved the placement of hidden microphones in new cameras at the embassy. He allegedly approved bugging the embassy with hidden microphones. He allegedly signed off on a plan to allow the CIA to “observe and listen to Assange’s daily activities at the embassy.”</p>\n<p>Also, the complaint claims Pompeo approved the copying of visitors’ passports, “including pages with stamps and visas.” He ensured that all “computers, laptops, mobile phones, recording devices, and other electronics brought into the embassy,” were “seized, dismantled, imaged, photographed, and digitized.” This included the collection of IMEI and SIM codes from visitors’ phones.</p>\n<p>Morales did not speak very good English, yet as further evidence that UC Global was working for the CIA, the complaint notes that UC Global employees were given “written technology instructions” for live streaming and audio associated with the surveillance” that were in “perfect English.”</p>\n<p>There was an “external streaming access point” for “American intelligence” sent from the “Venetian Hotel,” or the Las Vegas Sands, the complaint asserts.</p>\n<p>Around January 2017, Morales traveled to the Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor (SHOT) convention at Las Vegas Sands. The convention was an expo for the private security industry. Security personnel for Las Vegas Sands spoke with Morales and reportedly recruited Morales to spy on Assange for the CIA. (The Las Vegas Sands was owned by Sheldon Adelson, the late billionaire who bankrolled Trump&#8217;s campaign.)</p>\n<p>When Morales returned to Spain, at least one whistleblower from UC Global has said Morales told employees the company was now “in the big league,” and they would be working for the “dark side.” He indicated “the Americans” would help UC Global secure major contracts throughout the world.</p>\n<p>The complaint says former UC Global employees believe the “deal included selling information obtained through the illegal surveillance of Assange to the CIA.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the complaint claims that CIA handlers in the US were collecting recordings from Morales either through delivery to Las Vegas, Washington, DC, or New York or through transfers on an FTP server at UC Global offices that gave CIA personnel external access to the material.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Reporting from the Spanish newspaper <em>El País </em>previously <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/25/inenglish/1569384196_652151.html\">corroborated</a> many of the claims in the complaint. Their journalism was based upon primary source materials shared with them by whistleblowing UC Global employees.</p>\n<p>Some of these revelations were part of Assange’s challenge to the US extradition request, but a UK magistrates’ court dismissed the allegations as irrelevant to the indictment from the US Justice Department.</p>\n<p>There is a criminal case in a Spanish court against Morales and UC Global associates. US officials have refused to cooperate with requests from a Spanish judge for information about the CIA&#8217;s alleged involvement.</p>\n<p>Pompeo was <a href=\"https://peoplesdispatch.org/2022/06/07/spanish-court-summons-pompeo-over-rendition-and-assassination-plot-against-assange/\">summoned</a> by the Spanish court to provide testimony back in June.</p>\n<p>In September 2021, Yahoo! News <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-assassination-and-a-london-shoot-out-inside-the-ci-as-secret-war-plans-against-wiki-leaks-090057786.html\">published</a> a bombshell report on “secret war plans” against Assange that involved proposals for kidnapping and assassinating Assange after Pompeo became obsessed with the WikiLeaks founder following the media organization’s publication of CIA hacking materials that became known as the “Vault 7” materials.</p>\n<p>Pompeo labeled the organization a “non-state hostile intelligence agency,” and in April 2017, he made it the focus of his first speech as CIA director. “The one thing [current] whistleblowers don’t need is a publisher,” since the internet already enables enough sharing of information.</p>\n<p>During the speech, Pompeo called Assange a “coward,” a “fraud,” and a “narcissist.” He pledged to pursue a “long term” campaign to neutralize WikiLeaks.</p>\n<p>“Assange remained in the embassy in London for 7 years, believing he would face extradition to the US if he left the building,” stated Deborah Hrbek. “He was pilloried as a paranoid narcissist for this belief. As it turns out, he was right.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit is a Bivens action, which stems from a precedent-setting case that established the ability of US citizens to sue US government officials.</p>\n<p>US courts have been historically reluctant to allow plaintiffs to pursue damages, especially if it involves sensitive national security or foreign policy matters.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

the VFP letter states.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;These are not pie-in-the-sky ideas, but rather well-developed proposals from nuclear disarmament experts,&#8221; the letter continues. &#8220;It is our deep hope that you will take our approach to heart for the benefit of our country and of all humanity worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As <em>Common Dreams</em> previously <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/01/19/anti-war-veterans-group-issues-its-own-nuclear-posture-review\">reported</a>, VFP&#8217;s January report argues that</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;what we need now is a &#8216;nuclear posture&#8217; that enables us to reduce the real risk of nuclear confrontation through accidental launch or miscalculated escalation, and to accelerate a global reduction and rapid elimination of nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) details the current administration&#8217;s policies on such weapons. A classified version of Biden&#8217;s document was sent to Congress in March and at the time the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/29/2002965339/-1/-1/1/FACT-SHEET-2022-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-AND-MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW.PDF\">summarized</a> key takeaways in three short paragraphs.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;The NPR underscores our commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and reestablishing our leadership in arms control,&#8221; the DOD fact sheet says. &#8220;We will continue to emphasize strategic stability, seek to avoid costly arms races, and facilitate risk reduction and arms control arrangements where possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The DOD summary adds that Biden believes &#8220;the fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack,&#8221; and the president would only consider using such arms &#8220;in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.&#8221;</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><em>Air Force Magazine</em> <a href=\"https://www.airforcemag.com/sole-purpose-policy-nuclear-posture-review-biden-wants-it-future/\">reported</a> last week that <strong>Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl</strong> said the current NPR maintains the U.S. policy of &#8220;flexible deterrence&#8221; but Biden hopes to eventually shift to &#8220;sole purpose,&#8221; or only having nuclear arms to deter or respond to an attack.</p>\n<p>Kahl—who was speaking at a side event of an ongoing United Nations conference about the nonproliferation of nuclear arms—also said that an unclassified version of the NPR will be released &#8220;in the relatively near future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While encouraging Biden to hold off on his release until reviewing its proposals, Veterans for Peace, in the letter, also emphasized that the group&#8217;s members are &#8220;eager&#8221; to see his policy, especially considering how Russia&#8217;s February invasion of Ukraine and the response by Western powers have <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/06/extremely-concerned-shelling-europes-biggest-nuclear-power-plant-more-worrying\">ratcheted up</a> concerns of a nuclear conflict.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;We deserve a full accounting of your nuclear planning,&#8221; VFP wrote. &#8220;We want to know what you and your advisers consider reasonable during this time of confrontation between the U.S. and Russia, which between them hold the lion&#8217;s share of the world’s 15,000 nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The letter to Biden continues:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We need to know if you will be keeping nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert. Will you forswear the first use of nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We need to know if you will rejoin the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, unilaterally abandoned by President George W. Bush, and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, unilaterally abandoned by President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Will you contribute to an era of peaceful relations, or will you pursue antagonistic polices toward China and Russia? Will you continue investing billions of dollars on new nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Are you willing to risk a civilization-ending apocalypse by playing nuclear chicken with other nuclear-armed nations? Or will you lead us toward a planet that is free of nuclear weapons? We urge you to acknowledge and sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.</p>\n<p>The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2021/01/22/despite-absence-nuke-armed-states-world-celebrates-arrival-global-treaty-banning\">entered</a> into force last year but lacks the support of the world&#8217;s nine nuclear powers—and, as anti-war campaigners <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/01/threat-historic-high-nuclear-powers-urged-stop-violating-global-treaty\">pointed out</a> at the beginning of the U.N. summit earlier this month, nuclear-armed nations already refuse to abide by their existing treaty obligations.</p>\n<p>As activists kicked off the conference by urging countries with nuclear weapons to comply with treaties they&#8217;ve signed, support the TPNW, and work toward global disarmament, the U.N. chief <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/01/un-chief-says-humanity-one-miscalculation-away-nuclear-annihilation\">issued</a> a chilling reminder of what is at stake.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&#8220;Today,&#8221; warned U.N.<strong> Secretary-General António Guterres,</strong> &#8220;humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>From Common Dreams: Our work is licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0).

Iran is being targeted with nuclear weapons as part of a war agenda built on distortions and lies for the purpose of private profit. The real aims are oil, financial hegemony and global control. The price could be nuclear holocaust. When weapons become the hottest export of the world’s only superpower, and diplomats work as salesmen for the defense industry, the whole world is recklessly endangered. If we must have a military, it belongs entirely in the public sector. No one should profit from mass death and destruction.<br>\n<em>–<strong>Ellen Brown</strong>, author of ‘Web of Debt’ and president of the Public Banking Institute   </em></p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"copyright\">The original source of this article is <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/12/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-releasing-yours\" target=\"_blank\">Common Dreams</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"copyright\">Copyright © <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/author/jessica-corbett\" title=\"Posts by Jessica Corbett\">Jessica Corbett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/12/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-releasing-yours\" target=\"_blank\">Common Dreams</a>, 2022</div>\n<hr>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GlobalResearchCRG\"><strong>Comment on Global Research Articles on our Facebook page</strong></a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://store.globalresearch.ca/member/\"><strong>Become a Member of Global Research</strong></a>\n</p>\n</div> </div>\n</div>\n\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-2\" style=\"margin-left: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-left:5px\">\n<div id=\"jp-relatedposts\" class=\"jp-relatedposts\">\n<h3 class=\"jp-relatedposts-headline\"><em>Related Articles from our Archives</em></h3>\n</div> </div>\n<hr>\n\n<div class=\"sharethis\">\n<div class=\"sharethisleft\">\n<span style=\"float:left\"><span class=\"fontSize\" style=\"float:left\"><a href=\"#\" id=\"toggleFont\"></a></span> <p style=\"margin: 10px 0px;\" id=\"print-page-link\"><a id=\"print-link\" href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308?print=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"width: 25px;height: 25px;\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/plugins/print-me/images/printme.png\" title=\"print\"></a></p></span> <span style=\"float:right\"><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308?pdf=5790308\" target=\"_blank\"> <img style=\"height:23px;width:20px;margin-top:3px;margin-left:7px;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pdf01.png\"></a> </span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sharethisright\" style=\"display:flex;overflow:clip;max-height:25px;align-items:center;\">\n<span class=\"st_facebook_hcount\" st_title=\"Anti-War Veterans Group Asks Biden to &#8216;Read Our Nuclear Posture Review Before Releasing Yours&#8217;\" st_url=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308\" displaytext=\"facebook\"></span>\n<span class=\"st_fblike_hcount\" style=\"height:26px\" st_title=\"Anti-War Veterans Group Asks Biden to &#8216;Read Our Nuclear Posture Review Before Releasing Yours&#8217;\" st_url=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308\" displaytext=\"fblike\"></span>\n<span st_via=\"grtvnews\" st_username=\"grtvnews\" class=\"st_twitter_hcount\" st_title=\"Anti-War Veterans Group Asks Biden to &#8216;Read Our Nuclear Posture Review Before Releasing Yours&#8217;\" st_url=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308\" displaytext=\"twitter\"></span>\n<span class=\"st_email_hcount\" st_title=\"Anti-War Veterans Group Asks Biden to &#8216;Read Our Nuclear Posture Review Before Releasing Yours&#8217;\" st_url=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308\" displaytext=\"email\"></span>\n<span class=\"st_plusone_hcount\" style=\"width:1px; display: inline-block\" st_title=\"Anti-War Veterans Group Asks Biden to &#8216;Read Our Nuclear Posture Review Before Releasing Yours&#8217;\" st_url=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308\" displaytext=\"plusone\"></span>\n<span class=\"st_sharethis_hcount\" st_title=\"Anti-War Veterans Group Asks Biden to &#8216;Read Our Nuclear Posture Review Before Releasing Yours&#8217;\" st_url=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/anti-war-veterans-group-asks-biden-read-our-nuclear-posture-review-before-releasing-yours/5790308\" displaytext=\"sharethis\"></span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"articleAuthor\">\n<div class=\"authorName\">\n<span>Articles by:</span>\n<a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/author/jessica-corbett\" title=\"Posts by Jessica Corbett\">Jessica Corbett</a> </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"nr_clear\"></div>\n<div id=\"disclaimer\">\n<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Instead, he claimed, the bill simply closes a loophole that allows corporations to avoid paying all the taxes they owe. Despite what Senator Manchin says, the fact is the new minimum tax increases the amount of money some corporations must hand over to the government; in other words, it increases their taxes.</em></p>\n<p>It is common for politicians, policy wonks, and even some libertarians to demonize loopholes for making the tax system too complex, but loopholes are simply ways that individuals can keep more of their money. Loopholes are thus pro-liberty and pro-sound economics.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>In addition to raising taxes, the Inflation Reduction Act provides 80 billion dollars to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Some of the money will go to improving taxpayer services so, for example, taxpayers may actually talk to a real person who can provide information about the tax law when they call the agency. But, over 50 percent will be spent on enforcement.</p>\n<p>The IRS is expected to hire approximately 87,000 new agents. Supporters of the expansion say the IRS will use the enhanced enforcement capacity to target only “the rich.” However, it is not necessary to massively increase the IRS’s enforcement capacity just to go after “rich tax cheats.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, rich people and big corporations can hire attorneys and accountants to make sure they limit their tax liability while staying within the legal limits. They can also fight any attempt by the IRS to make them pay more. Middle- and working-class Americans are unable to afford legions of attorneys and accountants to limit their tax liability or fight the IRS, so they are more likely to pay whatever the IRS demands.</p>\n<p>The IRS has a history of disrespecting due process rights of Americans, so creating a new army of IRS agents with a mission to extract more money will lead to massive liberties violations. Given the IRS’s shameful history of harassing the political enemies of whoever holds power at the moment, we should expect the new agents to target opponents of US foreign policy, gun control, government promotion of green energy, and other policies of the current administration.</p>\n<p>The IRS recently ran an ad seeking agents who are willing to carry a firearm and use deadly force. This comes after the tax agency’s purchase this year of 700,000 dollars worth of ammunition. Perhaps the agency is worried that the latest attempt to get more taxes from Americans already suffering from the inflation tax will lead to violence, or perhaps the IRS wants its agents to carry firearms to remind taxpayers that the tax laws are backed by the threat of government violence.</p>\n<p>The premise behind the income tax is that the government is the true owner of all property and thus has the right to take as much from the people as it desires. Therefore, the income tax, like the other monstrosity created in 1913 — the Federal Reserve, is incompatible with a free society but necessary for an authoritarian welfare-warfare state. To avoid 1984, repeal 1913.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

The objective was to present &#8220;preemptive military action&#8221; &#8211;meaning war as an act of &#8220;self-defense&#8221; against two categories of enemies, &#8220;rogue States&#8221; and &#8220;Islamic terrorists&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">&#8220;The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. …America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed.(National Security Strategy, White House, 2002, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">The preemptive war doctrine also included the preemptive use of nuclear weapons on a &#8220;first strike&#8221; basis (as a means of &#8220;self-defence&#8221;) against both nuclear and non-nuclear states. This concept of  a preemptive first strike nuclear attack was firmly endorsed by Hillary Clinton in her election campaign.</p>\n<p>In turn, the &#8220;Global War on Terrorism&#8221;(GWOT) launched in the wake of 9/11 has come to play a central role in justifying US-NATO military intervention in the Middle East on &#8220;humanitarian grounds&#8221; (R2P), including the instatement of so-called &#8220;No Fly Zones&#8221;. GWOT also constitutes  the cornerstone of media propaganda.</p>\n<p>The military and intelligence dimensions of the Neocons&#8217; project are contained in<strong> The Project for the New American Century</strong> formulated prior to the accession of George W. Bush to the White House. The PNAC also posits a &#8220;Revolution in Military Affairs&#8221; requiring a massive budget outlay allocated to the development of advanced weapons systems including a new generation of nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-neocons-project-for-the-new-american-century-american-world-leadership-syria-next-to-pay-the-price/5305447\">The PNAC initiative was launched by William Kristol and Robert Kagan </a>whose wife Victoria Nuland, played a key role as Clinton&#8217;s Assistant Secretary of State in engineering the Euro-Maidan coup in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The Neocon project also includes a menu of &#8220;regime change&#8221;, &#8220;color revolutions&#8221;, economic sanctions and macro-economic reforms directed against countries which fail to conform to Washington&#8217;s demands.</p>\n<p>In turn, the globalization of war supports Wall Street&#8217;s global economic agenda: The (secretly negotiated) Atlantic and Pacific trade blocks (TPP, TTIP, CETA, TISA), coupled up with IMF- World Bank- WTO &#8220;surveillance&#8221; are an integral part of this hegemonic project, intimately related to US military and intelligence operations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-5404338 aligncenter\" title=\"project-new-american-century\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg 512w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century-400x232.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>&#8220;The Deep State&#8221; and The Clash of Powerful Corporate Interests</strong></h2>\n<p>Global capitalism is by no means monolithic. What is at stake are fundamental rivalries within the US establishment marked by the clash between competing corporate factions, each of which is intent upon exerting control over the incoming US presidency. In this regard,  Trump is not entirely in the pocket of the lobby groups. As a member of the establishment, he has his own corporate sponsors and fund raisers. His stated foreign policy agenda including his commitment to revise Washington&#8217;s relationship with Moscow does not fully conform with the interests of the defence contractors, which supported Clinton&#8217;s candidacy.</p>\n<p>There are powerful corporate interests on both sides, which are now clashing. There are also overlapping allegiances and &#8220;cross-cutting alliances&#8221; within the corporate establishment.  What we are witnessing are  &#8220;inter-capitalist rivalries&#8221; within the spheres of banking, oil and energy, the military industrial complex, etc.</p>\n<p>Is &#8220;The Deep State&#8221; divided?  These corporate rivalries are also characterized by strategic divisions and clashes within several agencies of the US State apparatus including the intelligence community and the military.  In this regard, the CIA is deeply embedded in the corporate media (CNN, NBC, NYT. WP, etc) which is waging a relentless smear campaign against  Trump and his alleged links to Moscow.</p>\n<p>But there is also a  countervailing campaign within the intelligence community against the dominant Neocon faction. In this regard, the Trump team is contemplating a streamlining of the CIA (aka purges). According to a member of the Trump transition team (quoted by the Wall Street Journal, January 4, 2017), “<em>The view from the Trump team is the intelligence world [is] becoming completely politicized, &#8230; They all need to be slimmed down. The focus will be on restructuring the agencies and how they interact.”</em> This project would also affect CIA operatives responsible for propaganda embedded within the mainstream media. This would inevitably create profound divisions and conflicts within the US intelligence apparatus, which could potentially backlash on the Trump presidency. it is unlikely that a Trump administration would be able to undermine the inner structures of US intelligence and CIA sponsored media propaganda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yiv0590505064realtor\"><strong>Continuity in US Foreign Policy? </strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-5400090\" title=\"kennan\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"192\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg 400w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan-246x300.jpg 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\"></a>Crafted in the late 1940s by US State Department official George F. Kennan, the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221; sets the ideological foundations of America&#8217;s post-war hegemonic project.  What these State department documents reveal is continuity in US foreign policy  from “Containment” during the Cold War to today’s post 9/11 doctrine of “Pre-emptive Warfare”.</p>\n<p>In this regard, the Neocons&#8217; <strong>Project for the New American Century’s</strong> blueprint (cited above) for global conquest should be viewed as the culmination of a post-war agenda of military hegemony and global economic domination formulated by the State Department in 1948 at the outset of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, successive Democratic and Republican administrations, from Harry Truman to George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been involved in carrying out this <strong>hegemonic blueprint for global domination</strong>, which the Pentagon  calls the “Long War”.</p>\n<p><a title=\"kennanbook\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennanbook.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[5400067]\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"kennanbook\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennanbook.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"92\" height=\"142\"></a>In this regard, the Neocons have followed in the footsteps of  the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221;. In the late 1940s, George F. Kennan called for building <strong>a dominant Anglo-American alliance</strong> based on “good relations between our country and [the] British Empire”.  In today’s world, this alliance largely characterizes the military axis between Washington and London, which plays a dominant role inside NATO to the detriment of Washington’s  (continental) European allies.  It also includes Canada and Australia as key strategic partners.</p>\n<p>Of significance, Kennan underscored the importance of <strong>preventing the development of continental European powers</strong> (e.g. Germany, France, Italy) which could compete with the Anglo-American axis. The objective during the Cold War and its aftermath was to prevent Europe from establishing political as well as economic ties with Russia. In turn, NATO largely dominated by the US has prevented both Germany and France from performing a strategic role in World affairs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trump Foreign Policy Realignments</strong></h2>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that a Trump administration would depart from the mainstay of US foreign policy.</p>\n<p>While the Trump team is committed to a socially regressive and racist right wing agenda on the domestic front, certain foreign policy realignments are possible including a softening of the sanctions against Russia, which could potentially have an impact on the multibillion dollar contracts of the military industrial complex. This in itself would be a significant achievement which could contribute to a period of Detente in East-West relations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while Trump has put together a right wing cabinet of generals, bankers and oil executives,  which largely conforms to the mainstay of the Republican Party, the bi-partisan &#8220;entente cordiale&#8221; between Democrats and Republicans has been broken. Meanwhile, there are powerful  voices within the GOP who are supportive of the &#8220;anti-Trump faction&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The divisions between these two competing factions are nonetheless significant. With regard to US foreign policy, they largely pertain to US-Russia bilateral relations which have been jeopardized by the Obama administration as well as to the ongoing US military agenda in Syria and Iraq. They also have a bearing on the European Union, which has been affected by Obama&#8217;s economic sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>The sanctions have resulted in a dramatic decline in EU trade and investment with the Russian Federation. In conformity with the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221; discussed above, US foreign policy under the Neocons, particularly since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, had sought <strong>to dismantle the Franco-German alliance and weaken the European Union.</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Of relevance in relation to recent developments in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, George F. Kennan explicitly pointed in his 1948 State Department brief, to<strong> “a policy of containment of Germany, within Western Europe”. </strong>What Kennan’s observations suggest is that the <strong>US should be  supportive of  a European Project only inasmuch as it supports US hegemonic interests. </strong>And that is precisely what the Neocons have achieved under the Bush and Obama administrations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today both Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel are taking their orders directly from Washington. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was a turning point. The election of pro-US political leaders (President Sarkozy in France and Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany) was conducive to a weakening of national sovereignty, leading to the demise of the Franco-German alliance. &#8221; (Michel Chossudovsky <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/americas-blueprint-for-global-domination-from-containment-to-pre-emptive-war-the-1948-truman-doctrine/5400067\">America’s Blueprint for Global Domination: From “Containment” to “Pre-emptive War”.</a> Global Research, 2014)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The more significant question is whether this realignment under a Trump administration will restrain the deployment of NATO troops and military hardware in Eastern Europe on Russia&#8217;s doorstep. Will it be conducive to nuclear disarmament?</p>\n<p>While Trump&#8217;s foreign policy agenda has been the target of &#8220;dirty politics&#8221; by the Clinton faction, the new administration has powerful corporate backers who will no doubt challenge the Neocons including those operating within the intelligence community. It is worth noting that Trump also has the support of the pro-Israel lobby as well as Israeli intelligence. In December, the head of Mossad met up with the Trump team in Washington.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Timeline of the Destabilization Project</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<div>At the outset, prior to the November 8 elections, the project to disrupt and destabilize the Trump presidency consisted of several coordinated and interrelated processes some of which are ongoing while others have already been completed (or are no longer relevant):</div>\n\nthe media smear campaign against Trump, which has taken on a new slant in the wake of the November 8 elections (ongoing);\nthe engineered anti-Trump protest movement across the US, coordinated with media coverage, petitions, with the objective to disrupt (ongoing);\nThe vote recount in three swing states, (No longer relevant)\nThe passing of  H.R 6393: Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which includes a section directed against so-called &#8220;pro-Moscow independent media&#8221;, in response to Moscow&#8217;s alleged interference in the US elections in support of Donald Trump;\nThe Electoral College Vote on December 19 (No longer relevant)\nThe Petition launched by California Sen Barbara Boxers on Change.org pertaining to the electoral College vote (No longer relevant)\nThe ongoing &#8220;Disrupt&#8221; Campaign intent upon disrupting the January 20, 2017 Presidential Inauguration Ceremony.\nThe possibility of an impeachment procedure is already contemplated during the first year of his mandate.\n\n<h2><strong>The Catch Phrase is &#8220;Disrupt&#8221;.

While the MSM routinely criticize politicians in high office including the president of the US, the media narrative in this case is fundamentally different. The incoming president is the target of an organized media smear campaign which will not subside upon Trump&#8217;s accession to the White House.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, an engineered and coordinated protest movement against Trump has been ongoing since November 8. In fact it started on the evening of November 8 prior to the announcement of the election results.  The protests have all the appearances of  a &#8220;color revolution&#8221; style op.</p>\n<p>The media also provides a biased coverage of the engineered protest movement. The organizers and recruiters are serving the interests of  powerful corporate lobby groups including the defence contractors. They are not serving the interests of the American people</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that these various initiatives including the Disrupt campaign will have a significant bearing on Trump&#8217;s inauguration. Our assessment suggests, however, that the president-elect will accede to the White House amidst an aura of controversy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Impeachment is the &#8220;Talking Point&#8221;</strong></h2>\n<p>The propaganda campaign will continue in the wake of Trump&#8217;s inauguration intimating accusations of treason. The impeachment of Donald Trump has already contemplated, prior to his accession to the presidency.

it has seen the pro-Western media machine cultivate and disseminate disinformation, propaganda and fake news on a previously unseen scale. While the U.S. and its NATO allies prosecute their proxy conflict on the ground, in the air, and at sea, another illicit battle is being fought on social media, TV and radio.</p>\n<p>Of course, propaganda and the winning of “hearts and minds” is nothing new when it comes to conflict. As far back as the 19th century Governments were aware of how important the narrative was at home, they actively sought to suppress details which they thought may be offensive or unhelpful to the home audience.</p>\n<p>In the second Boer war in South Africa (1899-1902), when the British Army’s colonial war was failing it resorted to imprisoning Boer Women and children in vast ill equipped concentration camps where a stunning 26,000 of them would die from starvation, ill treatment and disease. The British actively considered creating a publicity campaign to hide the true horror of the hellish camps, including false reports and newspaper stories.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44124 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=674%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?w=674&amp;ssl=1 674w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=150%2C89&amp;ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"331\" data-attachment-id=\"44124\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/13/war-propaganda-about-ukraine-starting-to-wear-thin/word-image-44120-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=674%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"674,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"word-image-44120-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=674%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Black woman in British concentration camp in the Boer War. Images like this were not publicized by the British media during the war. [Source: <a href=\"https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/featured/white-washing-the-boer-war/\">halifaxexaminer.ca</a>]</span></p>\n<p>Again, during World War I the gruesome details of mass casualties in the horrendous and inhumane trenches of the western front were also sterilized and minimized for the home audience. As far as the public were concerned the Kaiser was the killer, the Germans ate Belgian babies and the repulsive Teutonic octopus had to be stopped at all costs.</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that the entire conflict was about imperial power, commerce and competition between the three grandchildren of the British Queen Victoria was conveniently ignored. In July 1916 British newspaper reports on the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest battles in human history, famously read “Our casualties are not heavy,” an utterly misleading headline which sounds disturbingly familiar today.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>When we consider Americas most recent large-scale military misadventures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya these ill-advised and bloody failures have yet again been portrayed as the “good guys against the bad guys”, it’s the Cowboys against the Indians, the dangerous and untrustworthy Muslim savages against the very existence of Western civilisation.</p>\n<p>The immeasurable human suffering that these wars have visited on the innocent populations seldom features. American complicity and responsibility for creating the very problems they now seek to “solve” is bizarrely entirely ignored in its client media.</p>\n<p>Today’s conflict in Ukraine is no exception, a similar narrative is peddled with the historical truths about where conflict grew from remaining unreported. Some of the most critical facts relating to Ukraine are routinely and conveniently rendered invisible by the mainstream media, such as when this civil war began and most crucially, who paid for and built the scaffolding on which it is now burning.</p>\n<p>It is of course unpopular in any instance to swim against the flow of the tide, to be the child suggesting the emperor has no clothes, and to challenge “realities” that have been broadly accepted by a trusting public. Despite the gross imbalance in the presentation of the facts, up to now at least dissent was something accepted as a privilege of western democratic society, that freedom of speech and opinion is however in grave danger, particularly if it is based on inconvenient truths.</p>\n<h2><strong>The “Absolute Truth”</strong></h2>\n<p>When it comes to Ukraine <strong>a new, dangerous and lavishly funded weapon in the counter truth war has been deployed by western governments and media,</strong> I call it “Absolute Truth”. The Absolute truth doesn’t tolerate any challenges, when its allegations are proven false those realities are suppressed and ignored.</p>\n<p>It immediately and efficiently targets any dissent from the prescribed narrative and brands challengers as “enemies,” “foreign agents,” or “useful idiots.” Critically there is no room for debate of any kind, there is no analysis of facts, there is only their Absolute Truth.</p>\n<p>Should a journalist, State or individual question this Absolute Truth or merely suggest an objective analysis of the facts they are immediately and brutally marginalised and then targeted for retribution. This determined and choreographed punishment can range from the loss of a job to the isolation of an entire nation with threats of violence commonplace.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44159 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=696%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=696%2C696&amp;ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"\" width=\"464\" height=\"464\" data-attachment-id=\"44159\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/13/war-propaganda-about-ukraine-starting-to-wear-thin/1385077_orig/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1385077_orig\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=696%2C696&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BowesChay/status/1505248984255840261/photo/1\">twitter.com</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>The fact that the West’s “Absolute Truth” narrative relies implicitly on mass censorship and the wholesale destruction of freedom of speech</strong> is apparently irrelevant to its architects and disciples, if these pillars of liberal democracy must be abandoned in this war against the facts, so be it.</p>\n<p>Absolute truth also has a selective attitude when it comes to the behavior of its idols, when Mr Zelensky’s election with the assistance, cash and muscle of a corrupt oligarch is highlighted this is ignored, when his antidemocratic banning of all opposition and the imprisonment of its leaders comes up, its fine. if the Absolute Truth requires the acceptance and deployment of brutal Nazi militias against civilians, (previously designated by the west as terrorists) that is again entirely acceptable.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Absolute truth brigade have a magical ability to erase history, assign hero status to mass murders (Stepan Bandera) and demonise those that defeated Nazism in Europe. The Absolute Truth now defines the narrative, the facts do not, facts and independent evidence will be selectively deployed if at all, those that challenge this are immediately designated as collaborators, war mongers and enemies of democracy.</p>\n<p>Another sinister element of the cult of Absolute Truth is the reluctance to correct the record or admit when you get it wrong, from the “massacre” at Snake Island that never happened to the fake headlines about the Mariupol maternity hospital to name but a few, there is never any attempt to correct the record which begs the question how sincere were the allegations in the first place?</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44128 aligncenter\"

the internationally respected Amnesty international bravely countered the Absolute truth with indisputable facts, it was itself attacked by an increasingly paranoid Zelensky.</strong> There is now a distinct element of “the boy who cried wolf” about Zelensky’s persistent and now routine allegations of genocide, targeting of civilians and the apparent desire to “erase Ukraine from the map”.</p>\n<p>Any cursory examination of the facts around the Ukrainian Army’s “counter terrorist” operation against its own people in 2014 in Donbas would suggest it was an increasingly radicalised Ukrainian military that first assaulted the ethnic Russian populations in the east in 2014.</p>\n<p>As NATOs exceptionally costly and increasingly destructive proxy war against Russia grinds on, the prospect of any military victory for Ukraine fades almost hourly, the likelihood that Russia will seek settlement also fades by the day, any incentive to do so now strategically valueless.</p>\n<p>Western support for Zelensky’s seemingly rudderless and incompetent regime is privately wavering as the impact of ham-fisted sanctions against Russia threatens social cohesion in Europe and America alongside a global energy crisis.</p>\n<p>Promised counter offensives in the south have not materialized, the much vaunted “Million-man army” has failed to appear and yet again, the American and European press that presented this as fact have not rowed back on their outlandish claims.</p>\n<p>The harsh reality of war is seemingly lost on the “absolute Truth” brigade who are happmericy to “stand with Ukraine” but will never stand in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The western public are a fickle audience, given the lack of initial scrutiny generally applied to the mainstream narrative on Ukraine it’s likely that as more of the inconvenient truths about Zelensky, his junta and the realities of this conflict appear, more and more westerns will be creeping into their yards in the dead of night to take down their hastily hoisted Ukrainian flags.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the best efforts of those that have funded, molded and justified this proxy war the truth has a habit of resurfacing. It will be impossible to “manage” the oncoming tide of reality that will gush out of Ukraine as the western powers refocus on their self-inflicted domestic troubles this winter, Zelensky himself may become the fall guy for the failed NATO escapade in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing about those inconvenient facts, they keep persisting under the surface, the truth doesn’t have a sell by date, and it is patient, the memory of the countless dead demands it to be.</p>\n<p>And of course, as good old Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool part of the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

After the CIA drone strike killed Zawahiri on August 2, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/\">Biden declared</a>, “People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer.” What we should fear instead is the dangerous precedent set by Biden’s unlawful extrajudicial execution.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to being illegal, the killing of Zawahiri also occurred in a moment when the United Nations had already determined that people in the U.S. had little to fear from him. As a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/al-qaeda-terrorism-isis.html\">United Nations report released in July</a> concluded, “Al Qaeda is not viewed as posing an immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan because it lacks an external operational capability and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.”</p>\n<p>Just as former president Barack Obama stated that “<a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-dead\">Justice has been done</a>” after he assassinated <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong>, Biden said, “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/\">Now justice has been delivered</a>” when he announced the assassination of Zawahiri.</p>\n<p>Retaliation, however, does not constitute justice.</p>\n<p>Targeted, or political, assassinations are extrajudicial executions. They are deliberate and unlawful killings meted out by order of, or with acquiescence of, a government. Extrajudicial executions are implemented outside a judicial framework.</p>\n<p>The fact that Zawahiri did not pose an imminent threat is precisely why his assassination was illegal.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zawahiri’s Assassination Violated International Law</strong></h2>\n<p>Extrajudicial executions are prohibited by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, making it part of U.S. law under the Constitution’s supremacy clause. <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights\">Article 6 of the ICCPR</a> states, “Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.” In its interpretation of Article 6, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/CCPR/GCArticle6/GCArticle6_EN.pdf\">The UN Human Rights Committee opined</a> that all human beings are entitled to the protection of the right to life “without distinction of any kind, including for persons suspected or convicted of even the most serious crimes.”</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>“Outside the context of active hostilities, the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AgnesCallamard/status/1212918159096864768\">tweeted</a>Agnès Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. “Intentionally lethal or potentially lethal force can only be used where strictly necessary to protect against an imminent threat to life.” In order to be lawful, the United States would need to demonstrate that the target “constituted an imminent threat to others,” Callamard said.</p>\n<p>Moreover, willful killing is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, punishable as a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act. A targeted killing is lawful only when deemed necessary to protect life, and no other means (including apprehension or nonlethal incapacitation) is available to protect life.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zawahiri’s Assassination Violated U.S. Law</strong></h2>\n<p>The drone strike that killed Zawahiri also violated the <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp\">War Powers Resolution</a>, which lists three situations in which the president can introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities:</p>\n<p>First, pursuant to a congressional declaration of war, which has not occurred since World War II. Second, in “a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.” (Zawahiri’s presence in Afghanistan more than 20 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks did not constitute a “national emergency.”) Third, when there is “specific statutory authorization,” such as an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).</p>\n<p>In 2001, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf\">Congress adopted an AUMF</a> that authorized the president to use military force against individuals, groups and countries that had contributed to the 9/11 attacks “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”</p>\n<p>Zawahiri was one of a small circle of people widely believed to have planned the 2001 hijacking of four airplanes, three of which were flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center buildings. But since he did not pose “an immediate international threat” before the U.S. targeted him for assassination, he should have been arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>The attack against Zawahiri violated Obama’s targeting rules, which required that the target pose a “<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/presidential_policy_guidance.pdf\">continuing imminent threat.</a>” Although <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Donald Trump relaxed </a><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Obama’s rules</a>, Biden is conducting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/biden-drones.html\">a secret review</a>to establish his own standards for targeting killing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Biden Continues to Launch Illegal Drone Strikes</strong></h2>\n<p>In spite of the Biden administration’s claim that no civilians were killed during the strike on Zawahiri, there has been no independent evidence to support that assertion.</p>\n<p>The assassination of Zawahiri came nearly a year after <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/war-in-afghanistan-isnt-over-its-taking-the-form-of-illegal-drone-strikes/\">Biden launched an illegal strike</a> as he withdrew U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Ten civilians were killed in that attack. The U.S. Central Command admitted the strike was “a tragic mistake” after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">an extensive </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\"><em>New York Times </em></a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">investigation </a>put a lie to the prior U.S. declaration that it was a “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-drone-strike-mistake-civilians-killed-pentagon/\">righteous strike</a>.”</p>\n<p>Biden declared that although he was withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan, he would mount “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/politics/cia-afghanistan.html\">over-the-horizon</a>” attacks from outside the country even without troops on the ground. We can expect the Biden administration to conduct future illegal drone strikes that kill civilians.</p>\n<p>The 2001 AUMF has been used to justify <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2022/8/3/23289167/zawahiri-war-terror-afghanistan-us-biden\">U.S. military actions in 85 countries</a>. Congress must repeal it and replace it with a new AUMF specifically requiring that any use of force comply with U.S. obligations under international law.</p>\n<p>In addition, Congress should revisit the War Powers Resolution and explicitly limit the president’s authority to use force to that which is necessary to repel a sudden or imminent attack.</p>\n<p>Finally, the United States must end its “global war on terror” once and for all. Drone strikes terrorize and kill countless civilians and make us more vulnerable to terrorism.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

And to make sure that that doesn’t happen.” George Friedman, STRATFOR CEO at The Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs</span></em></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_2\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. It’s about Germany and, in particular, a pipeline that connects Germany to Russia called Nord Stream 2. Washington sees the pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at every turn. Even so, Nord Stream has pushed ahead and is now fully-operational and ready-to-go. Once German regulators provide the final certification, the gas deliveries will begin. German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean and inexpensive energy while Russia will see a significant boost to their gas revenues. It’s a win-win situation for both parties.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_3\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">The US Foreign Policy establishment is not happy about these developments. They don’t want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas because commerce builds trust and trust leads to the expansion of trade. As relations grow warmer, more trade barriers are lifted, regulations are eased, travel and tourism increase, and a new security architecture evolves. <b>In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners, there is no need for US military bases, no need for expensive US-made weapons and missile systems, and no need for NATO. </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>There’s also no need to transact energy deals in US Dollars or to stockpile US Treasuries to balance accounts. </b>Transactions between business partners can be conducted in their own currencies which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream.<b> It’s not just a pipeline, it’s a window into the future; a future in which Europe and Asia are drawn closer together into a massive free trade zone that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the US on the outside looking in.</b> </span></p>\n<p class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Warmer relations between Germany and Russia signal an end to the “unipolar” world order the US has overseen for the last 75 years. A German-Russo alliance threatens to hasten the decline of the Superpower that is presently inching closer to the abyss. This is why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream and keep Germany within its orbit. It’s a matter of survival.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_4\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">That’s where Ukraine comes into the picture. <b>Ukraine is Washington’s ‘weapon of choice’ for torpedoing Nord Stream and putting a wedge between Germany and Russia. </b>The strategy is taken from page one of the US Foreign Policy Handbook under the rubric: Divide and Rule.<b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>Washington needs to create the perception that Russia poses a security threat to Europe. That’s the goal. They need to show that Putin is a bloodthirsty aggressor with a hair-trigger temper who cannot be trusted.</b> To that end, the media has been given the assignment of reiterating over and over again, “Russia is planning to invade Ukraine.” What’s left unsaid is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and that the US has invaded or toppled regimes in more than 50 countries in the same period of time, and that the US maintains over 800 military bases in countries around the world. None of this is reported by the media, instead the focus is on “evil Putin” who has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border threatening to plunge all of Europe into another bloody war.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_5\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">All of the hysterical war propaganda is created with the intention of manufacturing a crisis that can be used to isolate, demonize and, ultimately, splinter Russia into smaller units. <b>The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany.</b> Check out this excerpt from an article by Michael Hudson at The Unz Review:</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_6\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\">“The only way left for U.S. diplomats to block European purchases <b>is to goad Russia into a military response</b> and then claim that avenging this response outweighs any purely national economic interest. As hawkish Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, explained in a State Department press briefing on January 27: <b>“If Russia invades Ukraine one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”</b> (<a title=\"https://www.unz.com/mhudson/americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies/\" href=\"https://www.unz.com/mhudson/americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies/\">“America’s Real Adversaries Are Its European and Other Allies”</a>, The Unz Review)</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_7\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">There it is in black and white.<b> The Biden team wants to “goad Russia into a military response” in order to sabotage NordStream.</b> That implies there will be some kind of provocation designed to induce Putin to send his troops across the border to defend the ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country. If Putin takes the bait, the response would be swift and harsh. The media will excoriate the action as a threat to all of Europe while leaders around the world will denounce Putin as the “new Hitler”. This is Washington’s strategy in a nutshell, and <b>the whole production is being orchestrated with one goal in mind; to make it politically impossible for the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to wave NordStream through the final approval process. </b></span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_8\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Given what we know about Washington’s opposition to Nord Stream, readers may wonder why earlier in the year the Biden administration lobbied Congress NOT to impose more sanctions on the project. The answer to that question is simple: Domestic politics. Germany is currently decommissioning its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to make up for the energy shortfall. Also, the threat of economic sanctions is a “turn-off” for Germans who see them as a sign of foreign meddling. “Why is the United States interfering in our energy decisions,” asks the average German. “Washington should mind its own business and stay out of ours.” This is precisely the response one would expect from any reasonable person.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_9\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Then, there’s this from Al Jazeera:</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_10\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>“Germans in the majority support the project, it is only parts of the elite and media who are against the pipeline</b>…</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_11\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>“The more the US talks about sanctioning or criticizes the project, the more it becomes popular in German society,”</b> said Stefan Meister, a Russia and eastern Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations.” (<a title=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/25/ukraine-russia-what-is-nord-steam-2-and-why-is-it-contentious\" href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/25/ukraine-russia-what-is-nord-steam-2-and-why-is-it-contentious\">“Nord Stream 2: Why Russia’s pipeline to Europe divides the West”</a>, AlJazeera)</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_12\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">So, public opinion is solidly behind Nord Stream which helps to explain why Washington settled on a new approach. Sanctions are not going to work, so <b>Uncle Sam has flipped to Plan B: Create a big enough external threat that Germany will be forced to block the opening of the pipeline</b>. Frankly, the strategy smacks of desperation, but you have to be impressed by Washington’s perseverance. They might be down by 5 runs in the bottom of the 9th, but they haven’t thrown in the towel just yet. They’re going to give it one last shot and see if they can make some headway.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_13\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">On Monday, President Biden held his first joint-press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The ballyhoo surrounding the event was simply unprecedented.<b> Everything was orchestrated to manufacture a “crisis atmosphere” that Biden used to pressure the chancellor in the direction of US policy</b>. Earlier in the week, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki repeatedly said that a “Russian invasion was imminent.” Her comments were followed by State Department flak Nick Price opining that the Intel agencies had provided him with details of an alleged Russian-backed “false flag” operation they expected to take place in the near future in east Ukraine. Price’s warning was followed on Sunday morning by national security advisor Jake Sullivan claiming that a Russian invasion could happen at any time maybe “even tomorrow.” This was just days after Bloomberg News agency had published its sensational and utterly-false headline that “Russia Invades Ukraine”.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_14\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Can you see the pattern here? Can you see how these baseless claims were all used to apply pressure to the unsuspecting German chancellor who seemed oblivious to the campaign that was aimed at him?</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_15\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">As one might expect, the final blow was delivered by the American president himself. During the press conference Biden stated emphatically that,</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_16\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>“If Russia invades … there will no longer [be] a Nord Stream 2.. We will bring an end to it.”</b></span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_17\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">So, now Washington sets policy for Germany???</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_18\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">What insufferable arrogance!</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_19\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">The German chancellor was taken aback by Biden’s comments which clearly were not part of the original script. Even so,<b> Scholz never agreed to cancel Nord Stream and refused to even mention the pipeline by name. If Biden thought he could sandbag the leader of the world’s third biggest economy by cornering him in a public forum, he guessed wrong</b>. Germany remains committed to launching Nord Stream regardless of potential flare-ups in far-flung Ukraine. But that could change at any time. After all, who knows what incitements Washington might be planning in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are prepared to sacrifice in order to put a wedge between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is willing to take to slow America’s decline and prevent a new “polycentric” world order from emerging? Anything could happen in the weeks ahead. Anything.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_20\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">For now, Germany is in the catbird seat. It’s up to Scholz to decide how the matter will be settled. <b>Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he cave in to Biden’s relentless arm twisting?</b> Will he chart a new course that strengthens new alliances in the bustling Eurasian corridor or will he throw his support behind Washington’s crazed geopolitical ambitions? <b>Will he accept Germany’s pivotal role in a new world order</b>— in which many emerging centers of power share equally in global governance and where the leadership remains unflinchingly committed to multilateralism, peaceful development and security for all–<b> or will he try to prop up the tattered post-War system that has clearly outlived its shelf-life?</b></span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_21\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">One thing is certain; whatever Germany decides is bound to affect us all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"container\">*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The theme was echoed by <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> who cited the income guarantee that is offered by countries like Denmark and Finland as a possible model for future development.</em></p>\n<p><em>Both Yang and Sanders argued that automation of production and other technological changes taking place in America have created a lag in job creation even as the economy flourishes, and that such a state can be responded to best with a universal basic income.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are advantages and disadvantages to a basic income that demand a thoughtful debate among citizens, in the media and in the halls of government. Such a debate is absolutely impossible in the current environment of oppression.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What we have now is a universal basic income being forced upon us without any democratic due process or accountability. It is known as the “corona virus stimulus check.”</strong> The newspapers tell us that we may get another $1,200 in the mail soon if congress passes a bill.</p>\n<p>So let us step back and think about this check for $1,200 that the government offers us. <strong>For many of us, the current shutdown has ended our economic lives, left us unemployed. The stimulus check is the only form of payment we receive. It is our de facto “universal basic income” –like it or not.</strong> But does this universal basic income allow us to be creative artists, to volunteer in our neighborhoods, to have the financial security that will allow us to fully realize ourselves?</p>\n<p>No, sadly, this universal basic income has been imposed upon us from above. Who knows who made up the idea. Certainly no one asked our opinions. We have no say in how much it is for, or who gets it. One thing is certain: for most of us, it is not anywhere near enough.</p>\n<p>Also, the debate on the universal basic income assumes that income is the critical issue for Americans. No serious economist believes this fraud. The primary issue in the United States is assets, ownership. And assets are dominated by a tiny handful of the rich.</p>\n<p><strong>The over-the-top response to COVID-19 has shut down the United States economy and led to massive unemployment in the course of just a few months.</strong> This pre-planned controlled demolition of the economy has left us begging for a universal basic income and we are getting it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, billionaires are getting billions of dollars in subsidies, as are CEOs. They do not need a universal basic income because they make their money off of speculation, off of the money they print up, off of what they take from us. COVID-19 is about a massive transfer of wealth and unless that transfer is stopped, basic income will be of little help.</p>\n<p><strong>Most of us are facing eviction, our small stores are being shut down by arbitrary regulations on our free movement, and no small number of us face starvation and homelessness in the next few months unless action is taken now.</strong></p>\n<p>Giving us a basic income without addressing the massive concentration of wealth, which has grown exponentially worse over just the last five months, is a recipe for disaster. Doing so after creating an environment in which we have no choice but to accept those checks is criminal.</p>\n<p>The super-rich have spent the last twelve years, and especially the last three months, printing up money through the Federal Reserve and giving it back to themselves. If we do not take that money back, economic inequality cannot be countered.</p>\n<p>Between five and ten trillion dollars disappeared while you were distracted. If we leave the artificially created economic disparity in the United States untouched, if we let the looters at the top keep their loot, the free money from the government will not be free. It will be paid for with your taxes (certainly not taxes on multinational corporations with their headquarters offshore) or it will raise the national debt and eat away at your buying power.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>We cannot grow our own food, we cannot produce our own energy, and we cannot create our own clothes, furniture, and other products for daily life. We can only use the money that we are paid by corporations to purchase products at big stores run by multinational corporations, offering products produced overseas by poorly paid workers.</p>\n<p>The government has become the toy of the rich and powerful. High government officials, judges and even middle-level officials are appointed with the backing of multinational corporations and investment banks. The politicians are even worse.</p>\n<p>The actual experts in government have been removed and government functions, which are essential, have been outsourced to private corporations who do today what the government did, but with a focus on short-term profits, and not on the people. These companies are paid with your tax dollars to do the job of government, but they never swore and oath to the constitution, and their primary mission is delivering profits to their owners.</p>\n<p>The redistribution of assets, the complete transparency of the government and the complete end to the unwarranted and dangerous influence of the wealthy, and of the banks and corporations that they control, over the formulation of policy must come before we can start to discuss basic income.</p>\n<p>We need to consider why the banks want to cultivate in us habits of dependency and passivity. After all, if all we can do is sit around watching TV until our stimulus check comes, we will be unable to organize ourselves into groups capable of taking action, we will be unable to build our own economies.</p>\n<p>Let us talk for a moment about the relationship between technology and the proposed universal basic income. The argument advanced by Yang and Sanders was that automation, and the growth of AI and other technologies, are reducing jobs because they are not being formed in other sectors even as productivity increases. Therefore, we need a UBI to assure that workers displaced by new technologies have employment and can adapt to a new work reality.</p>\n<p>It is assumed that, just as the sun rises in the East, automation, the implementation of AI and the end of human to human interactions is a natural law that cannot be violated, that is beyond the realm of policy discussion.</p>\n<p>But are we truly forced to tear apart the natural order of society in order to satiate the cruel god of technology demanding endless sacrifice for the sake of an inevitable fourth industrial revolution, for the sake of the inevitable domination of the Earth by automation, driver-less cars, robots and drones? Is the internet of things truly the Kingdom Come?</p>\n<p>Is the promotion of AI (artificial intelligence) in accord with God’s covenant with man? Or is it rather a scheme to increase profits for the few, and drive the common man, the common woman, into poverty and dependency?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question is not obvious. It demands an open discussion involving experts on society, on technology, on governance and on economics, but also ordinary citizens who understand better than anyone else what the impact of technology can be. Moreover, the discussion should be transparent and scientific in nature, leaving no space for the wealthy who benefit from automation and AI to disguise their wish list as scientific truth.</p>\n<p>Productivity without job growth is the standard line used to justify this basic income. Productivity is the holy cow that cannot be approached by any but the anointed high priests, a false concept cooked up to justify just about anything. It is not the law of gravity or the second law of thermodynamics. It is the biased and warped idea that holds that certain forms of economic activity to be more important than others.</p>\n<p>If you spend the day helping your sick mother, tending vegetables in the community farm, volunteering with the handicapped, or playing with your children, that activity is not considered productive by those who make up the rules of productivity.</p>\n<p>But if you destroy forests or farmland to build unnecessary shopping malls, if you poison rivers and lakes with the run off from factory farms, or from uranium mines, or if you wage wars abroad, that is consider productivity. The gap between employment and productivity is most certainly not simply a result of technological change.</p>\n<p>Finally, we need to consider where the United States stands in history at this moment, and where we have come from, before we can talk about where we are going.</p>\n<p>In the previous generation there was a profound ideological and economic competition between the market economies of the United States and Europe and the socialist economies of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. We refer to it, imprecisely, as the Cold War.</p>\n<p>The United States held up the ideal that there was no limit to what the individual could achieve through his or her efforts and we argued that individual freedoms were more critical than the common good.</p>\n<p>The socialist economies assumed that economic equality was central for a healthy society and took preemptive measures to assure a relatively egalitarian economy.</p>\n<p>I grew up in the United States. We assumed that we could have economic fairness and at the same time the ability obtain rewards in accord to our special efforts in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>But, what we assumed to be a natural state was not at all natural. The massive accumulation of wealth, the exploitation of workers, and the abuse of child labor were standard practice in the late nineteenth century, and even into the 1930s.</p>\n<p>But the existence of the socialist block out there, imperfect though it was, put unending pressure on the United States to modify the system and to allow for a more just society — granted there were profound limits.</p>\n<p>In the late 1930s, the threat of revolution within the United States also was real and it forced action on labor issues that would otherwise have been ignored.</p>\n<p>We may not have been aware of that pressure, but it made things like welfare and the minimum wage possible.</p>\n<p>The salaries of CEOs were capped. Taxes on the rich went up to 90% and there were no billionaires, or offshore tax havens. America was not that way because the rich were virtuous. It was that way because there was endless pressure.</p>\n<p>When the so-called “communist block” was subject to commercialization from the 1990s on, and the ideological opposition dropped off, the United States slowly shifted back to the ruthless market economy it had once enjoyed, one in which workers were expendable. This time, however, automation and drones, AI and robots, made it possible to engage in an even more ruthless experiment.</p>\n<p>But the shifts in American society, like climate change, were too slow for us to grasp. We were too caught up with email and Facebook to notice.</p>\n<p>We could not perceive that the rules we had accepted had disappeared, that a ruthless shiny brave new world had been born.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we cannot discuss a universal basic income in the United States until we start to create a culture, a system, in which some counter force exists to stand up for the interests of ordinary citizens. That is the ultimate question. That counter force, however, must be built by you, by me and by us, and not by experts or by politicians and most certainly not by corporations with their drones and robots.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
