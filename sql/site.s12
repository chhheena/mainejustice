Today, under Joe Biden, tens of thousands of these same heroes are denounced as rebels, conspiracy theorists, extremists and potential terrorists. Along with massive numbers of police, firemen, Border Patrol agents, Navy SEALs, pilots, air-traffic controllers, and countless other truly essential Americans, they’re all considered so dangerous as to merit termination, their professional and personal lives turned upside down due to their decision not to be injected with the experimental COVID vaccines. Biden’s tyrannical mandate threatens to cripple American society – from law enforcement to airlines to commercial supply chains to hospitals. It’s already happening.

Today, under Joe Biden, tens of thousands of these same heroes are denounced as rebels, conspiracy theorists, extremists and potential terrorists. Along with massive numbers of police, firemen, Border Patrol agents, Navy SEALs, pilots, air-traffic controllers, and countless other truly essential Americans, they’re all considered so dangerous as to merit termination, their professional and personal lives turned upside down due to their decision not to be injected with the experimental COVID vaccines. Biden’s tyrannical mandate threatens to cripple American society – from law enforcement to airlines to commercial supply chains to hospitals. It’s already happening. But the good news is that huge numbers of “yesterday’s heroes” are now fighting back – bravely and boldly.

(Official White House photo by Cameron Smith)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Democrats and other leftists in America during the Joe Biden administration have adopted a “double standard” of using laws against President Trump that they never enforced against their political allies, like Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>That’s the opinion of Alan Dershowitz, the Felix Frankfurter professor of law emeritus at Harvard and a longtime, well-known liberal commentator on legal issues, expressed in a column at the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/18809/trump-double-standard\">Gatestone Institute.</a></p>\n<p>In fact, he said, “Those of us who — despite our opposition to Trump politically — insist that the same standards of civil liberties must be applied to him as to those we support politically, have lost friends, been defamed by the media and been cancelled.”</p>\n<p>He continued, “This unacceptable double standard is so widespread that it endangers the rule of law and the historic role of neutral, non-partisan civil liberties that protect it from partisan weaponization.”</p>\n<p>How have the leftists warped the standards to attack Trump? Multiple ways, he explained.</p>\n<p>Most recently are the allegations created by the Biden Department of Justice regarding the Espionage Act of 1917 against Trump, which was the basis for an FBI raid of Trump’s home.</p>\n<p>Trump supporters have bluntly stated it was a fishing trip hunting for anything that could be used to discourage Trump from running for office in 2024, as he’s the leading GOP candidate for president even before announcing.</p>\n<p>Democrats already have staged two failed attempts at impeaching him and removing him from office, and also have a Democrat-run House committee investigating Jan. 6, which so far has failed to alter the political landscape in America.</p>\n<p>Dershowitz explained, “In the past, many leftist civil libertarians have railed against the breadth and scope of this [Espionage] law, calling it repressive and unconstitutionally vague. Among the people who were prosecuted, indicted or investigated under the Espionage Act are progressive icons such as socialists Eugene V. Debs and Charles Schenk, antiwar activists Daniel Ellsberg and Dr. Benjamin Spock, whistleblowers Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning, anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, as well as many others who made unpopular speeches, engaged in protests or took other actions deemed unpatriotic by the government.”</p>\n<p>But, he said, now the “shoe is on the other foot.”</p>\n<p>“Now that the same law is being deployed against a possible presidential candidate they deplore — many of these same leftists are demanding that this accordion-like law be expanded to fit Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified material. The ACLU, which has repeatedly challenged the constitutionality and applicability of the Espionage Act to anti-government activities by left-wing radicals, is strangely silent when the same overbroad law is deployed against a political figure whose politics they deplore.”</p>\n<p>Dershowitz explained the “same double standard” was evident during the FBI’s search of Trump’s home.</p>\n<p>“Many civil libertarians have complained about the overuse of search warrants in situations where a ‘less intrusive’ and narrower subpoena would suffice. Even U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged that the policy of the Justice Department is to use measures less intrusive than a full-blown search whenever possible. Yet he did not explain why a day-long search of Trump’s home was necessary, especially since a subpoena had been issued and could have been judicially enforced if the government was dissatisfied with the progress of negotiations. Again, silence from the ACLU and other left-wing civil libertarians.”</p>\n<p>And, he said, it’s not just Trump in the cross-hairs.</p>\n<p>“Then there is the manner by which Trump loyalists have been treated when they were indicted. Several have been arrested, handcuffed and shackled, despite not having been charged with crimes of violence and despite the absence of evidence that they were planning to flee. In my long experience, most other comparable defendants are simply notified of the charges and ordered to appear in court. Yet despite this apparent double standard, the left has been silent.”</p>\n<p>He suggested Garland’s standard now suggests, “Due process for me but not for thee.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the most glaring manifestation of the double standard currently at work is the different approach taken to the alleged mishandling of classified material by Trump, on the one hand, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, on the other hand. No wide-ranging search warrants were sought for Clinton’s home, where private servers were apparently kept and subpoenaed material even possibly destroyed,” he pointed out.</p>\n<p>There never have been any prosecutions for that “comparable mishandling” of classified information.</p>\n<p>The idea of “one standard of civil liberties” appears to have gone missing “from recent attempts to ‘get’ Trump and his loyalists,” he said.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Today, under Joe Biden, tens of thousands of these same heroes are denounced as rebels, conspiracy theorists, extremists and potential terrorists. Along with massive numbers of police, firemen, Border Patrol agents, Navy SEALs, pilots, air-traffic controllers, and countless other truly essential Americans, they’re all considered so dangerous as to merit termination, their professional and personal lives turned upside down due to their decision not to be injected with the experimental COVID vaccines. Biden’s tyrannical mandate threatens to cripple American society – from law enforcement to airlines to commercial supply chains to hospitals. It’s already happening. But the good news is that huge numbers of “yesterday’s heroes” are now fighting back – bravely and boldly. The whole epic showdown is laid out as never before in the sensational October issue of WND’s monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower-single-issue-october-2021/\">“THE GREAT AMERICAN REBELLION: ‘We will not comply!’ COVID-19 power grab ignites bold new era of national defiance.”</a></i></p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Today, under Joe Biden, tens of thousands of these same heroes are denounced as rebels, conspiracy theorists, extremists and potential terrorists. Along with massive numbers of police, firemen, Border Patrol agents, Navy SEALs, pilots, air-traffic controllers, and countless other truly essential Americans, they’re all considered so dangerous as to merit termination, their professional and personal lives turned upside down due to their decision not to be injected with the experimental COVID vaccines. Biden’s tyrannical mandate threatens to cripple American society – from law enforcement to airlines to commercial supply chains to hospitals. It’s already happening. But the good news is that huge numbers of “yesterday’s heroes” are now fighting back – bravely and boldly. The whole epic showdown is laid out as never before in the sensational October issue of WND’s monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower-single-issue-october-2021/\">“THE GREAT AMERICAN REBELLION: ‘We will not comply!’ COVID-19 power grab ignites bold new era of national defiance.”</a></i></p>\n<p><i>Content created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Democrats certainly could not run an election based upon the record and glib performance of Joe Biden and his Congress. They found they needed something bigger than starting a $100 billion war on the border with Russia. They transitioned to capturing and imprisoning political prisoners, and even stagged a KKK-style congressional hearing and public lynching – but it was not enough to distract Americans.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up: zilch!</p>\n<p>Why not raid the home of the former president, and then stage a weekly “what if” or “look over here at what we found …” to feed the fear. This from the same FBI that covered up the Biden laptop from hell and the Hillary Clinton private server!</p>\n<p>What might we expect during the intervening 90 days before the November 2022 election? The search and seizure by the FBI was not necessary, but it will be a win/win for Democrats.</p>\n<p>Without the raid, the media would be forced to continue to focus on inflation and economic disaster, the classroom chaos brought by a communist-spawned CRT curriculum, the death and destruction wrought by the criminal class, repeated foreign-policy debacles, the abandonment of America’s borders, massive homelessness, record drug abuse and general failure of the Democratic Party in Congress and the White House.</p>\n<p>But with this raid, the media, which are 99.9% pure Democratic leftist, will be able to focus on their Nemesis, Donald Trump. Let the nightly shock and awe begin.</p>\n<p>To make sure the scandal runs the up to Election Day, the U.S. Justice Department and FBI “will not comment” on “an ongoing investigation,” which leaves the press free to speculate.</p>\n<p>The press speculation will portray Donald Trump as the worst criminal in history. No insult will be left unsaid. As the partisan work of the faux Jan. 6 Committee fades into nothingness, like the two impeachment trials before it, the chief players in the justice system have set the table for a Democratic victory in November.

Democrats certainly could not run an election based upon the record and glib performance of Joe Biden and his Congress. They found they needed something bigger than starting a $100 billion war on the border with Russia. They transitioned to capturing and imprisoning political prisoners, and even stagged a KKK-style congressional hearing and public lynching – but it was not enough to distract Americans.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up: zilch!</p>\n<p>Why not raid the home of the former president, and then stage a weekly “what if” or “look over here at what we found …” to feed the fear. This from the same FBI that covered up the Biden laptop from hell and the Hillary Clinton private server!</p>\n<p>What might we expect during the intervening 90 days before the November 2022 election? The search and seizure by the FBI was not necessary, but it will be a win/win for Democrats.</p>\n<p>Without the raid, the media would be forced to continue to focus on inflation and economic disaster, the classroom chaos brought by a communist-spawned CRT curriculum, the death and destruction wrought by the criminal class, repeated foreign-policy debacles, the abandonment of America’s borders, massive homelessness, record drug abuse and general failure of the Democratic Party in Congress and the White House.</p>\n<p>But with this raid, the media, which are 99.9% pure Democratic leftist, will be able to focus on their Nemesis, Donald Trump. Let the nightly shock and awe begin.</p>\n<p>To make sure the scandal runs the up to Election Day, the U.S. Justice Department and FBI “will not comment” on “an ongoing investigation,” which leaves the press free to speculate.</p>\n<p>The press speculation will portray Donald Trump as the worst criminal in history. No insult will be left unsaid. As the partisan work of the faux Jan. 6 Committee fades into nothingness, like the two impeachment trials before it, the chief players in the justice system have set the table for a Democratic victory in November. A Nov. 8 victory is the Democrats’ target, not Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Two years ago the politicization of justice in America set up the election of the most unqualified, incapable presidential candidate imaginable.

Adolf Hitler, John D. Rockefeller, John Harvey Kellogg, Margaret Sanger and Josef Mengele were the Klaus Schwabs, Justin Trudeaus, Gavin Newsoms, Jacinda Arderns and Anthony Faucis of their generation: protean transhumanist sociopaths for whom humanity was mere cattle whose utility could and should be improved by scientific experimentation and selective breeding/culling.</p>\n<p>Addressing the future of eugenic advancement in “Mein Kampf” (1924), Hitler praised the United States as the “one state in which at least weak beginnings toward a better conception are noticeable.

They were the first to use the swastika in Germany more than a decade before the Nazi Party was formed, and Lanz von Liebenfels was rightly called “The Man Who Gave Hitler His Ideas” in a 1958 book by Wilfried Daim. Hitler was an avid reader and collector of Liebenfels magazine Ostara, which blended occultism and eugenics. I have fully documented this history in Chapter 2 of “The Pink Swastika.”</p>\n<p>(I can personally attest that the Theosophical Society still operates around the world, having stumbled onto <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://portland.theosophical.org/\">one of its lodges</a> when I lived in heavily occult-influenced Portland, Oregon. And a revived version of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armanen-Orden\">Armanen Order</a> also exists in Germany.)</p>\n<p>So, yes, the Holocaust was a real historical event, and the malign ideology that spawned it is alive and well today. Attempts by nut-jobs to rehabilitate uber-eugenicist Hitler as a wrongly “canceled” and misunderstood hero of nationalism are as traitorous to humanity as they are stupid.</p>\n<p>However, my focus in this article is the Holocaust as a symbol of victimization of the Jews specifically, and how the LGBT movement has, to a limited extent, hijacked it to serve their own political agenda.</p>\n<p>Kevin Abrams and I wrote “The Pink Swastika” in large part to debunk the myth of a “Gay Holocaust” in Nazi Germany equivalent to what the Jews suffered. We proved their claims were wildly exaggerated and that their adoption of the inverted pink triangle (used by the Nazis to identify the relatively small number of homosexual in labor camps – not the death camps) was a cynical political ploy to hijack the Holocaust, just as they had hijacked the rainbow flag and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/2020/08/06/the-lgbt-hijacking-of-black-power/\">control of the black civil rights movement</a> from the Black Panthers and Jesse Jackson’s “Rainbow Coalition.”</p>\n<p>In addition to our book, we created the International Committee for Holocaust Truth in 1996, whose most prominent members were the late Drs. Judith Reisman and Howard Hurwitz, and Rabbi Yehuda Levin. We then published a report for the ICHT titled “Refuting ‘Gay Holocaust’ Revisionists,” which I reworked for my article <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/2022/08/13/how-homosexuals-hijacked-the-holocaust/\">“How American ‘Gays’ are Stealing the Holocaust,”</a> which was published as Part 3 of my book <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/scott-lively-books/the-poisoned-stream-gay-influence-in-human-history-germany-1890-1945/\">“The Poisoned Stream” (1997).</a></p>\n<p>Working with a national network of Orthodox rabbis, we used those tools to thwart the “Gay Holocaust” plot and forced the LGBTs to drop the pink triangle strategy. In response, they shifted to the rainbow as their banner, and they down-scaled and moved their Holocaust hijack efforts out of the public view.</p>\n<p>In 1997, during my summer law program studying International Human Rights at the University of Strasbourg (France), I took a weekend trip to nearby Munich, Germany, to visit the Dachau concentration camp in my research for the third edition of “The Pink Swastika.” There I was disappointed to find (even then) the pink triangle prominently represented in the form of a stone monument, establishing a propaganda beachhead that (I now know) was later expanded to a high-visibility <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://forward.com/culture/376261/new-german-monument-honors-gays-and-lesbians-persecuted-by-nazis/\">“Gay Holocaust”</a> memorial in downtown Munich itself, psychologically emphasizing the special importance of the “gays” relative to the Jews as a victim class.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the new Munich memorial (which I only just learned about) commemorates the site of a “gay bar” that was the prime meeting place of Ernst Roehm’s butch-homosexual SA Brownshirts, whose role as chief Nazi perpetrators overwhelmingly dwarfs the significance of the relatively few homosexual victims they persecuted (for effeminacy and/or Communist affiliation).</p>\n<p>I had not given much thought to the “Gay Holocaust” hoax since the late ’90s until a recent walk along the waterfront in New Orleans brought me face to face with its high-visibility Holocaust memorial, prominently featuring the LGBT rainbow. That brought all the memories of the Measure 9 campaign – and the Brownshirt-style bullying of the “gay” fascists we suffered – flooding back, along with a resolve to speak out anew against their continuing historical revisionism.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/slively220816.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"648\" height=\"287\" /></p>\n<p>Note to the reader: I have decided to update and republish my 1997 ICHT report in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the Measure 9 vote in November.

We then published a report for the ICHT titled “Refuting ‘Gay Holocaust’ Revisionists,” which I reworked for my article <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/2022/08/13/how-homosexuals-hijacked-the-holocaust/\">“How American ‘Gays’ are Stealing the Holocaust,”</a> which was published as Part 3 of my book <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scottlively.net/scott-lively-books/the-poisoned-stream-gay-influence-in-human-history-germany-1890-1945/\">“The Poisoned Stream” (1997).</a></p>\n<p>Working with a national network of Orthodox rabbis, we used those tools to thwart the “Gay Holocaust” plot and forced the LGBTs to drop the pink triangle strategy. In response, they shifted to the rainbow as their banner, and they down-scaled and moved their Holocaust hijack efforts out of the public view.</p>\n<p>In 1997, during my summer law program studying International Human Rights at the University of Strasbourg (France), I took a weekend trip to nearby Munich, Germany, to visit the Dachau concentration camp in my research for the third edition of “The Pink Swastika.” There I was disappointed to find (even then) the pink triangle prominently represented in the form of a stone monument, establishing a propaganda beachhead that (I now know) was later expanded to a high-visibility <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://forward.com/culture/376261/new-german-monument-honors-gays-and-lesbians-persecuted-by-nazis/\">“Gay Holocaust”</a> memorial in downtown Munich itself, psychologically emphasizing the special importance of the “gays” relative to the Jews as a victim class.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the new Munich memorial (which I only just learned about) commemorates the site of a “gay bar” that was the prime meeting place of Ernst Roehm’s butch-homosexual SA Brownshirts, whose role as chief Nazi perpetrators overwhelmingly dwarfs the significance of the relatively few homosexual victims they persecuted (for effeminacy and/or Communist affiliation).</p>\n<p>I had not given much thought to the “Gay Holocaust” hoax since the late ’90s until a recent walk along the waterfront in New Orleans brought me face to face with its high-visibility Holocaust memorial, prominently featuring the LGBT rainbow. That brought all the memories of the Measure 9 campaign – and the Brownshirt-style bullying of the “gay” fascists we suffered – flooding back, along with a resolve to speak out anew against their continuing historical revisionism.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/slively220816.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" width=\"648\" height=\"287\" /></p>\n<p>Note to the reader: I have decided to update and republish my 1997 ICHT report in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the Measure 9 vote in November.

The deep state likes to pretend that Executive Branch privileges and authorities existed only before and after Trump, but not during his term. That is a lie.</p>\n<p>What’s more, there are plenty of people who are aware of just how big a lie that is.</p>\n<p>In an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo over the weekend, former Trump national security figure Kash Patel addressed the issue.</p>\n<p>“He can literally stand over a set of documents and say these are now declassified and that is done with definitive action immediately,” Patel explained.</p>\n<p>Bartiromo <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/you-jerks-devin-nunes-furious-with-trump-raid-65571/\">then cited reports that a grand jury has been convened</a> and espionage charges against the former president have been discussed, while asking another guest, former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) — now CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group — to respond.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I think that’s another really important point that shouldn’t be lost on the American people today, and that is that they convened a grand jury against the former president of the United States,” the former lawmaker said.</p>\n<p>“And they went into the grand jury looking at the president for treason as if he’s, And look, if that was the case, if he really was holding these these these documents, these so-called classified documents and documents, we even heard, you know, leaks of nuclear secrets that the president was holding. Well, that’s preposterous. And if that was true, you should have sent, they should have immediately sent and made this public and sent FBI agents around Mar-a-Lago if the nuclear secrets were really there,” he continued.</p>\n<p>“But the fact that they convened a grand jury to accuse a president, again, this look, this is the second time, this never stopped. Remember, back in 15 and 16 is when they started first saying that he was colluding with Russians and Vladimir Putin and Republicans were all colluding with the Russians. They went to a grand jury with that,” he argued.</p>\n<p>“So so once again, this is a continued investigation of Trump and the Republican Party. It’s basically an investigation in search of a crime. And then conveniently, they brought back the Mueller witch hunt argument that ‘Oh, my God, he’s he’s obstructing justice,’” Nunes added.</p>\n<p>“Obstructing justice on what? you jerks!” he said.</p>\n<p>There is <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.trump.news\">a full-court press on to indict Trum</a>p so he can’t run for the presidency again in 2024.

This includes cash for a cadre of 200 “special agents” that engage in SWAT-style ops.</em></p>\n<p>“We were shocked ourselves to find these kinds of pervasive expenditures at an agency that is supposed to be involved in clean air and clean water,” said Open the Books’ founder, Adam Andrzejewski, a former gubernatorial candidate in Illinois. “Some of these weapons are for full-scale military operations.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, some of the military-style ops carried out by EPA teams had already been reported in the media. Two years earlier, an EPA team conducted an armed raid in a small Alaska town where miners had been accused of polluting some local waters. Fox News noted then that the EPA’s “armed agents in full body armor” took part in the raid.</p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\" /></a><p>The EPA’s website at the time described the mission and activities of its criminal enforcement division as “investigating cases, collecting evidence, conducting forensic analyses and providing legal guidance to assist in the prosecution of criminal conduct that threatens people’s health and the environment.”</p>\n<p><i>The Spectator</i> added then that Obama was not completely to blame, noting that the agency first obtained police powers in 1988, at the close of the Reagan administration. But by the time of the outlet’s report, EPA was engaged in what a separate media outlet described as “environmental crime-fighting.”</p>\n<p>“For more than 30 years, there has been broad, bipartisan agreement about the importance of an armed, fully-equipped team of EPA agents working with state and federal partners to uphold the law and protect Americans,” the agency’s website said then.</p>\n<p>But Open the Books found more. For instance, supporting the armed EPA SWAT-style teams is a legion of highly paid attorneys and other staffers.</p>\n<p>The whistleblower group found that seven of 10 EPA workers earn in excess of $100,000 (again, in 2015) while the agency’s then-$8 billion budget also financed the salaries of 1,000 lawyers, making the agency one of the country’s largest law firms.</p>\n<p><i>The Specator</i> noted further:</p>\n<p><em>The EPA is hardly going solo in this armed adventure against America, however. The agency has collaborated with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and a recent report by the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that more than 40 federal agencies, with 100,000 officers, carry guns and make arrests.</em></p>\n<p>As for the EPA’s authority, the U.S. Supreme Court’s Trump-imposed conservative majority gave Americans some respite in its latest session, which ended in June.</p>\n<p>The court’s 6-justice conservative majority dramatically curbed the agency’s power.</p>\n<p>The ruling stated “that the Environmental Protection Agency cannot put state-level caps on carbon emissions under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Such authority would, in effect, steer states away from coal and toward other types of power sources that emit less carbon,” Harvard University’s School of Public Health noted in an online assessment.</p>\n<p>“The Court said that, instead, the authority to decide how power is created in the U.S. must come from Congress,” the explainer added.</p>\n<p>Anytime <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.biggovernment.news\">a federal agency loses power</a>, that’s a good thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/the-supreme-court-curbed-epas-power-to-regulate-carbon-emissions-from-power-plants-what-comes-next/\">HSPH.Harvard.edu</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://spectator.org/64333_armed-epa-agents-truth-way-out-there/\">Spectator.org</a></p>\n<!--<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n			xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n			xmlns:trackback=\"http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/\">\n		<rdf:Description rdf:about=\"2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html\"\n    dc:identifier=\"2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html\"\n    dc:title=\"Not the first time: Democrat weaponization of IRS follows historic path of regime militarizing other federal agencies including the EPA\"\n    trackback:ping=\"2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html/trackback\" />\n</rdf:RDF>-->', 'https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-democrat-weaponization-irs-follows-path-party-militarizing-other-federal-agencies.html', 'NaturalNews.com', '2022-08-16 12:21:14', 'YTowOnt9', '132daa31d8cc23ce9bfb5c8d33b55a4c0ee4c11a', '1', '0', '0'),

Not a single word about it. Come to find out, this was blatant misinformation. In fact, this is the premise of all the highly toxic COVID-19 so-called “vaccines” and the truth is out. The nanoparticles are known to get distributed THROUGHOUT the entire body, and according to research from <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/what-ive-seen-in-the-last-two-years-is-unprecedented-physician-on-covid-vaccine-side-effects-on-pregnant-women_4428291.html\">two in-depth studies</a>, for women, those lipid nanoparticles (cargo of the messenger RNA) concentrate in the ovaries. This all happens within 48 hours, according to unveiled documents and scientific research.</p>\n<p>Once internal documents like these are revealed, usually thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, pharma gurus and regulatory agency heads often “come out of the closet” and admit at least some of the truth to the public. Now we know. All of the human organs, including vital cleansing organs and reproductive organs, are exposed to toxic substances that can have catastrophic effects on function and fertility. These <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vital%20organs,\">toxic particles stick</a> to adrenal glands and vital organs, including the spleen, ovaries, liver and more.</p>\n<p>It should come as no surprise to those well-aware of the pharmaceutical industrial complex’s long history of corruption and scandals that they knew of this unequivocal science-based evidence before the “vaccines” were ever administered to the populace.</p>\n<h2><strong>During clinical trials, severe adverse effects and deaths mounted to nearly 50% for pregnant women who received these toxic nanoparticle jabs</strong></h2>\n<p>“A high local accumulation of nanoparticles, nanocapsules and nanoemulsions in specific locations of the ovaries was found in all animals,” read the report that the pharmaceutical industry buried. They all knew for years that the mRNA injections and the protein payload injections leave the injection site and spread throughout the entire body using the vascular system as its roadways and spike protein “technology” as the Trojan horse to enter cells and change human DNA forever.</p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\" /></a><p>Wake up and smell the nanoparticles. Obviously, these sticky spike protein nanoparticles, also known as prions, can cause myocarditis, pericarditis, strokes, cancer and abortions. In other words, the COVID-19 vaccines are population reduction mechanisms and part of a secret biomedical terrorism campaign waged around the world. It’s no conspiracy theory when the proof comes out from internal documents that completely counter the narrative LIE we’ve all heard over and over.</p>\n<p>This is Pandora’s box. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we KNOW 100 percent for sure that the spike protein toxins leave the injection site and spread throughout the body, harming all vital systems, we also know about many other avenues of misinformation spread by the FDA, CDC, Fauci, Walensky and other pharma shills and charlatans.</p>\n<h2><strong>Top 8 ADMISSIONS of GUILT by the CDC, FDA, Fauci, and top immunologists about COVID-19 vaccine dangers</strong></h2>\n<p>#1.

Meanwhile, governments are still pushing the shots as the “cure” for Chinese Germs.</p>\n<p>The United Kingdom Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) “Ambulance Syndromic Surveillance System – Week 30” bulletin offers a glimpse into the carnage using Great Britain as the example. There, emergency ambulance calls are through the roof due to post-injection “complications,” and the health care system is now on the verge of collapsing.</p>\n<p>Since at least last August when Operation Warp Speed was in full swing, the number of emergency calls for potentially life-threatening heart issues has nearly doubled – and that number is only increasing with each passing day.

Post-Operation Warp Speed, that number has increased by nearly 50 percent – with an even worse outcome for the over-30 category.</p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\" /></a><p>“The average number of annual call-outs between 2017 and 2020 equates to 24,463.

Meaning the number of call-outs increased by 82% in 2021.”</p>\n<p>Many people missed it because it was published quietly without any fanfare, but a study conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://heartdisease.news\">risk of myocarditis post-injection</a> with an mRNA (messenger RNA) shot is an astounding 133 times higher than the background risk for the general population.</p>\n<p>Put a different way, getting shot for the Fauci Flu <i>massively</i> increases your risk of serious heart problems.</p>\n<p>“This means Covid vaccination increases the risk of suffering myocarditis by a shocking 13,200%,” <i>Exposé News</i> says.</p>\n<p>“Eventually, myocarditis weakens the heart so that the rest of the body doesn’t get enough blood. Clots can then form in the heart, leading to a stroke or heart attack. Other complications of the condition include sudden cardiac death.”</p>\n<p>“There is no mild version of myocarditis, it is extremely serious due to the fact that the heart muscle is incapable of regenerating. Therefore, once the damage is done there is no rewinding the clock.”</p>\n<p>For both England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes weekly death figures from which it can be determined that excess deaths all around the world are now in the hundreds of thousands – all due to covid shots.</p>\n<p>Comparing age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 among both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated reveals that death rates are soaring in every place of the world where Fauci Flu shots were widely received by the public.</p>\n<p>“There is no other conclusion that can be found for the fact mortality rates per 100,000 are the lowest among the unvaccinated other than that the Covid-19 injections are killing people,” <i>Exposé News</i> contends.</p>\n<p>Pfizer’s covid injections are a death sentence – either immediately or later on down the road.

For over a year, the CDC contended that the mRNA quickly degrades in the body after it is injected. They also claimed that the translated spike proteins stay in the deltoid muscle, where they are quickly neutralized by immune-responsive cells. These vaccine-encoded spike proteins were heralded as a “safe and effective” immunization, preparing the body to fight SARS-CoV-2. However, the entire process has made <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114228\">vaccinated individuals more susceptible to future strains</a> of the virus. Even worse, the persistence of spike proteins in the blood causes blood clots and inflammation of other organs, especially the heart.</p>\n<h2>CDC silently retracts “settled science” after misleading millions of people</h2>\n<p>Scientists, doctors and researchers who questioned or challenged the CDC’s assertions were blocked across social media and accused of spreading “misinformation.” Many have lost their jobs or had their license threatened. Now, the CDC is silently retracting “settled science” they once demanded the public worship. The CDC quietly altered its website, confessing that the mRNA and the spike proteins persists in the body for an extended duration of time. Also, the CDC finally admitted that there is no logical reason to treat vaccinated people differently than unvaccinated people because both can readily contract and transmit coronavirus variants. Even worse, the vaccine subverts the initial surveillance immune cells, leading to inferior intracellular T-cell response.</p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\" /></a><p>The CDC once claimed that “our cells break down mRNA from these vaccines and get rid of it within a few days after vaccination.” Now the CDC says, “Scientists estimate that the spike protein, like other proteins our bodies create, may stay in the body up to a few weeks.” Additionally, the CDC recently removed this statement from their website: “mRNA and the spike protein do not last long in the body.” The vaccine manufacturers drastically underestimated the replication force of the mRNA. The regulatory agencies never fully understood how the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w\">immune responsive cells would react</a> to these foreign proteins.</p>\n<p>Runaway spike protein synthesis has serious implications for human health. If the mRNA does not degrade quickly, it can force human cells to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://spikeprotein.news\">replicate inflammatory spike proteins</a> for a longer duration, causing cardiovascular and organ damage. This would inevitably block the production of natural proteins that the body needs in order to function properly. If the spike proteins are not being properly neutralized by the immune system, they may colonize in distant organs, causing inflammation in unpredictable locations throughout the body.</p>\n<h2>Another CDC lie debunked: COVID vaccines DO negatively affect human DNA</h2>\n<p>Under a tab titled, “Facts About mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines, the CDC also claims that the shots “do not affect or interact with our DNA.” “[The] mRNA from these vaccines do not enter the nucleus of the cell where our DNA (genetic material) is located, so it cannot change or influence our genes,” the CDC contends. However, a study out of Sweden finds evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike enters the nuclei of the cell and impairs the DNA damage repair process. The study, <em>SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro</em>, confirms that the COVID vaccines <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/10/2056/htm\">interfere with human DNA just hours after vaccination</a>. The spike proteins that are translated by the mRNA vaccines were found to enter the nuclei of cells, blocking the cell’s ability to repair damaged DNA.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that the mRNA vaccines impede important DNA repair proteins (BRCA1 and 53BP1). In essence, the COVID vaccines are altering DNA through a molecular mechanism that damages adaptive immunity. Breached cell nuclei could also spell further harms in the long term. “Our study shows that [Pfizer’s mRNA injection] … can be reverse-transcribed to DNA … and this may give rise to concern if BNT162b2-derived DNA may be integrated into the host genome and affect the integrity of genomic DNA, which may potentially mediate genotoxic side effects,” wrote the researchers.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdc.news\">The CDC is collapsing</a>, and every lie emanating from the vaccine industry will be exposed.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/08/cdc-quietly-removes-statement-says-mrna-spike-protein-not-last-long-body-website/\">TheGateWayPundit.com</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114228\">NEJM.org</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w\">CDC.gov</a></p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/10/2056/htm\">MDPI.com</a></p>\n<!--<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n			xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n			xmlns:trackback=\"http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/\">\n		<rdf:Description rdf:about=\"2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html\"\n    dc:identifier=\"2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html\"\n    dc:title=\"CDC is quietly altering its website, now admitting that mRNA persists in the body for an extended duration\"\n    trackback:ping=\"2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html/trackback\" />\n</rdf:RDF>-->', 'https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-16-cdc-altering-website-admitting-mrna-persists-in-body.html', 'NaturalNews.com', '2022-08-16 08:29:33', 'YTowOnt9', '582d61509b938f7ce0759b31f573b816e58d91b9', '1', '0', '0'),

They allege that the agency under Pompeo spied on them in violation of their privacy rights</em>.</p>\n<p>Undercover Global S.L., a private security company in Spain, and the company’s director David Morales are also named as defendants. UC Global ramped up surveillance against Assange and shared audio and video footage from the embassy with “American intelligence.”</p>\n<p>“The United States Constitution shields American citizens from US government overreach even when the activities take place in a foreign embassy in a foreign country. Visitors who are lawyers, journalists and doctors frequently carry confidential information in their devices,” declared Richard Roth, who is the lead attorney representing the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>“They had a reasonable expectation that the security guards at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would not be US government spies charged with delivering copies of their electronics to the CIA,” Roth added.</p>\n<p>Two of the plaintiffs are attorneys who have represented Assange—Margaret Rather Kunstler, a civil rights activist and human rights attorney, and Deborah Hrbek, a media lawyer.</p>\n<p>The other two plaintiffs are journalists Charles Glass and John Goetz, who worked for Der Spiegel when the German media organization first partnered with WikiLeaks to publish documents on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit comes around two months after United Kingdom <strong>Home Secretary Priti Patel</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thedissenter.org/uk-government-approves-assanges-extradition-to-united-states/\">approved</a> the US extradition request against Assange. His legal team has <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thedissenter.org/assange-appeals-extradition-to-united-states/\">submitted</a> two separate appeals in the UK courts, yet it is increasingly evident that Assange could be flown to the US to face Espionage Act charges that civil liberties, human rights, and press freedom organizations around the world have condemned.</p>\n<p>According to the complaint [<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22136105-complaint-cia-pompeo-sued-by-journalists-and-attorneys-who-visited-assange\">PDF</a>] filed in a US court in the Southern District of New York, Glass, Goetz, Hrbek, and Kunstler, like all visitors, were required to “surrender” their electronic devices to UC Global employees hired by Ecuador to provide security for the embassy. What they did not know is that UC Global “copied the information stored on the devices” and allegedly shared the information with the CIA. Pompeo allegedly authorized and approved the action.</p>\n<p>Security required plaintiffs to leave their devices with them, which contained “confidential and privileged information about their sources or clients. This information was copied and allegedly shared with the CIA.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that “well over 100 American citizens who visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy” had their privacy rights violated. This includes attorneys who were there to represent Assange, journalists who traveled to interview him, and even doctors who came to the embassy to assess and treat his deteriorating health. Their privileged communications stored on electronic devices were compromised.</p>\n<p>The CIA-backed spying operation began around January 2017 and lasted until UC Global’s contract was terminated around April 2018. By that time, the Justice Department under President Donald Trump already had a sealed indictment against Assange.</p>\n<p>Pompeo allegedly approved the placement of hidden microphones in new cameras at the embassy. He allegedly approved bugging the embassy with hidden microphones. He allegedly signed off on a plan to allow the CIA to “observe and listen to Assange’s daily activities at the embassy.”</p>\n<p>Also, the complaint claims Pompeo approved the copying of visitors’ passports, “including pages with stamps and visas.” He ensured that all “computers, laptops, mobile phones, recording devices, and other electronics brought into the embassy,” were “seized, dismantled, imaged, photographed, and digitized.” This included the collection of IMEI and SIM codes from visitors’ phones.</p>\n<p>Morales did not speak very good English, yet as further evidence that UC Global was working for the CIA, the complaint notes that UC Global employees were given “written technology instructions” for live streaming and audio associated with the surveillance” that were in “perfect English.”</p>\n<p>There was an “external streaming access point” for “American intelligence” sent from the “Venetian Hotel,” or the Las Vegas Sands, the complaint asserts.</p>\n<p>Around January 2017, Morales traveled to the Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor (SHOT) convention at Las Vegas Sands. The convention was an expo for the private security industry. Security personnel for Las Vegas Sands spoke with Morales and reportedly recruited Morales to spy on Assange for the CIA. (The Las Vegas Sands was owned by Sheldon Adelson, the late billionaire who bankrolled Trump’s campaign.)</p>\n<p>When Morales returned to Spain, at least one whistleblower from UC Global has said Morales told employees the company was now “in the big league,” and they would be working for the “dark side.” He indicated “the Americans” would help UC Global secure major contracts throughout the world.</p>\n<p>The complaint says former UC Global employees believe the “deal included selling information obtained through the illegal surveillance of Assange to the CIA.”</p>\n<p>Additionally, the complaint claims that CIA handlers in the US were collecting recordings from Morales either through delivery to Las Vegas, Washington, DC, or New York or through transfers on an FTP server at UC Global offices that gave CIA personnel external access to the material.</p>\n<p>[embedded content]</p>\n<p>Reporting from the Spanish newspaper <em>El País </em>previously <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/25/inenglish/1569384196_652151.html\">corroborated</a> many of the claims in the complaint. Their journalism was based upon primary source materials shared with them by whistleblowing UC Global employees.</p>\n<p>Some of these revelations were part of Assange’s challenge to the US extradition request, but a UK magistrates’ court dismissed the allegations as irrelevant to the indictment from the US Justice Department.</p>\n<p>There is a criminal case in a Spanish court against Morales and UC Global associates. US officials have refused to cooperate with requests from a Spanish judge for information about the CIA’s alleged involvement.</p>\n<p>Pompeo was <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://peoplesdispatch.org/2022/06/07/spanish-court-summons-pompeo-over-rendition-and-assassination-plot-against-assange/\">summoned</a> by the Spanish court to provide testimony back in June.</p>\n<p>In September 2021, Yahoo!

As it turns out, he was right.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit is a Bivens action, which stems from a precedent-setting case that established the ability of US citizens to sue US government officials.</p>\n<p>US courts have been historically reluctant to allow plaintiffs to pursue damages, especially if it involves sensitive national security or foreign policy matters.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

But there is one exception to that generalization, though one hesitates to call it a benefit, consisting of the White House’s adoption of the Israel practice of referring to opponents as “terrorists.” Israel uses it as a generic cover designation to denigrate and humiliate the Palestinians while also delegitimizing their resistance, permitting them to torture and kill Arabs at will, destroy their homes, and bomb them mercilessly. Washington, which claims to be the font of a “rules based international order” as well as the defender of global “democracy” and “freedom,” has developed since 9/11 an unfortunate tendency to do the same thing as the Israelis to justify its attacks on civilians and its brutal assassination policies.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\">the US and Israel</a> are generally speaking the only two countries that openly use “targeted assassination” as a political tool without even bothering to fall back on “plausible denial” to conceal their actions.

The media coverage described how the Agency relentlessly stalked al-Zawahiri, described as the mastermind of 9/11, eventually learning that the 71-year-old was living in a house in an upscale Kabul neighborhood. It was also determined that he spent most days sitting on a terrace at the top of the house. The hellfire drone that killed him targeted the terrace at the time of day when he was normally sitting outside. Taliban sources report that his body was torn apart and incinerated by the two missiles that apparently struck him.</span></p>\n<p><span>The White House is, of course, framing the assassination as a great success, a major blow in the war against terror. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is hoping that it will improve the administration’s dismal approval ratings in the lead-up to the November elections, but the information given to the media regarding the incident praising the CIA’s tenacity and professional expertise is perhaps a bit over the top. Alternative reports from Afghanistan suggest that al-Zawahiri was living quite openly in Kabul and that he has not been active in any presumably radical activities for many, many years <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">beyond making</a> a number of “conspiracy theory” videos. Both al-Zawahiri and al-Qaeda founder <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> were, at the times when they were assassinated by the US, leading quiet lives with little protection even though they allegedly continued to be nominal leaders of al-Qaeda, an organization that had lost its <em>raison d’etre</em> years before.</span></p>\n<p><span>Al-Zawahiri’s record as a terrorist comes largely from US and UK intelligence sources as well as media innuendo, which should be automatically considered unreliable. Recall for a moment the lying that the George W. Bush administration engaged in to go to war with Iraq, with folks like Condoleezza Rice speaking of mushroom clouds spewing radiation over the US and a shop in the Pentagon run by a group of neocons producing fabricated intelligence reports. What has been confirmed from independent sources is that al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, was savagely tortured by the secret police during a crackdown on political dissidents initiated by US puppet <strong>President Hosni Mubarak</strong>. The torture reportedly radicalized him, and he joined Osama bin Laden’s underground group, later apparently becoming its nominal leader after bin Laden was himself killed in May 2011 by US Navy Seals. Much of the rest of al-Zawahiri’s presumed biography relies on little in the way of actual evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span>What actually happened on 9/11 and who was behind it remains somewhat a mystery as all the apparent perpetrators of which might have occurred are dead. Consider for a moment that Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri never actually admitted that their group al-Qaeda was the perpetrator of the attack. In fact they denied it, sometimes attributing it to other radicalized Saudi Arabian underground groups. Nor is there any actual evidence that they planned the attack. They were accused because they had the claimed track record, resources, motive and possible access to carry out the incident, not because there was any real evidence that they had done the deed. When the US approached the Taliban government of Afghanistan in late 2001 and demanded that bin Laden be turned over to American law enforcement, the Afghans responded that bin Laden was a guest in their country, but they would surrender him if Washington could demonstrate that he had organized and ordered the attacks. George W. Bush’s Pentagon and the CIA apparently could not make that case based on actual evidence, leading to the decision to go to war instead.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, of all the hundreds of “terrorist” prisoners that have been recycled through <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">the US military prison at Guantanamo</a> only five have ever been charged with any involvement in 9/11. They are still being held but have never been tried and it is quite possible the case against them can never be made. They might even be completely innocent.</span></p>\n<p><span>And there is more to the story. Bin Laden could have been arrested and tried but the Barack Obama administration decided to kill him and dump his body at sea, presumably to avoid a courtroom drama that would reveal government malfeasance. And then there are <strong>Anwar Nasser al-Awlaki</strong> and his son<strong> Abdulrahman</strong>, both of whom were American citizens killed by CIA drones in Yemen, where their family originated. The al-Awlakis may or may not have been actual members of al-Qaeda, but the elder al-Awlaki’s sermons and writings certainly inspired groups that opposed US foreign policy’s hostility towards Muslims. It is widely believed that Anwar al-Awlaki could have been captured and tried in the US if an attempt to do so had been pursued, but instead the Obama Administration again decided that he should be killed.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, there is the death by drone of Iranian <strong>General Qassem Soleimani</strong> in January 2000 under President Donald Trump. In a recent book, Trump’s Defense Chief <strong>Mark Esper</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\">claims that</a> Trump lied after the assassination was criticized by saying that Soleimani was actively preparing “terror” attacks on four American Embassies in the Mideast region. Esper confirms that there was no intelligence to back up that claim, but interestingly goes beyond that to make clear that there was no specific intelligence at all suggesting that such an attack was imminent or even being planned. There were only generic regional security threats that many embassies in the world respond to and make preparations to defend against.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Esper claim is supported by the Iraqi government itself, which declared that Soleimani, widely regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran after the Ayatollah, was in Baghdad to discuss peace arrangements and that the US Embassy had been informed of his planned trip and had raised no objection to it. Instead, the US used the opportunity to launch an armed drone to kill him and nine Iraqi militia members that were accompanying him from the airport. In other words, there was no imminent threat, nor even a plausible threat, and the US went ahead anyway and killed a senior Iranian government official in a targeted assassination.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, the United States and Israel have a formula down pat whereby they can kill anyone anywhere without any due process or rule of law, even if they don’t know who you are as in the cases of the “signature” or “profile” executions by drone in Afghanistan. And all the presidents and senior officials know that no matter what they do there will be no accountability. All one has to do is call it terrorism prevention, which might include citing terrorist attacks that can in no way be linked by way of actual evidence to the person being killed. Once a terrorist, always a terrorist, repeat as needed, and the public and media will swoon with pleasure at being so well-protected. And, as the Israeli general described it, the end result will be “really clean, very nice” an “exceptional achievement.”</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

When the US approached the Taliban government of Afghanistan in late 2001 and demanded that bin Laden be turned over to American law enforcement, the Afghans responded that bin Laden was a guest in their country, but they would surrender him if Washington could demonstrate that he had organized and ordered the attacks. George W. Bush’s Pentagon and the CIA apparently could not make that case based on actual evidence, leading to the decision to go to war instead.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, of all the hundreds of “terrorist” prisoners that have been recycled through <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">the US military prison at Guantanamo</a> only five have ever been charged with any involvement in 9/11. They are still being held but have never been tried and it is quite possible the case against them can never be made. They might even be completely innocent.</span></p>\n<p><span>And there is more to the story. Bin Laden could have been arrested and tried but the Barack Obama administration decided to kill him and dump his body at sea, presumably to avoid a courtroom drama that would reveal government malfeasance. And then there are <strong>Anwar Nasser al-Awlaki</strong> and his son<strong> Abdulrahman</strong>, both of whom were American citizens killed by CIA drones in Yemen, where their family originated. The al-Awlakis may or may not have been actual members of al-Qaeda, but the elder al-Awlaki’s sermons and writings certainly inspired groups that opposed US foreign policy’s hostility towards Muslims. It is widely believed that Anwar al-Awlaki could have been captured and tried in the US if an attempt to do so had been pursued, but instead the Obama Administration again decided that he should be killed.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, there is the death by drone of Iranian <strong>General Qassem Soleimani</strong> in January 2000 under President Donald Trump. In a recent book, Trump’s Defense Chief <strong>Mark Esper</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\">claims that</a> Trump lied after the assassination was criticized by saying that Soleimani was actively preparing “terror” attacks on four American Embassies in the Mideast region. Esper confirms that there was no intelligence to back up that claim, but interestingly goes beyond that to make clear that there was no specific intelligence at all suggesting that such an attack was imminent or even being planned. There were only generic regional security threats that many embassies in the world respond to and make preparations to defend against.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Esper claim is supported by the Iraqi government itself, which declared that Soleimani, widely regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran after the Ayatollah, was in Baghdad to discuss peace arrangements and that the US Embassy had been informed of his planned trip and had raised no objection to it. Instead, the US used the opportunity to launch an armed drone to kill him and nine Iraqi militia members that were accompanying him from the airport. In other words, there was no imminent threat, nor even a plausible threat, and the US went ahead anyway and killed a senior Iranian government official in a targeted assassination.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, the United States and Israel have a formula down pat whereby they can kill anyone anywhere without any due process or rule of law, even if they don’t know who you are as in the cases of the “signature” or “profile” executions by drone in Afghanistan. And all the presidents and senior officials know that no matter what they do there will be no accountability. All one has to do is call it terrorism prevention, which might include citing terrorist attacks that can in no way be linked by way of actual evidence to the person being killed. Once a terrorist, always a terrorist, repeat as needed, and the public and media will swoon with pleasure at being so well-protected. And, as the Israeli general described it, the end result will be “really clean, very nice” an “exceptional achievement.”</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

A classified version of Biden’s document was sent to Congress in March and at the time the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/29/2002965339/-1/-1/1/FACT-SHEET-2022-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-AND-MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW.PDF\">summarized</a> key takeaways in three short paragraphs.</p>\n<p>“The NPR underscores our commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons and reestablishing our leadership in arms control,” the DOD fact sheet says. “We will continue to emphasize strategic stability, seek to avoid costly arms races, and facilitate risk reduction and arms control arrangements where possible.”</p>\n<p>The DOD summary adds that Biden believes “the fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack,” and the president would only consider using such arms “in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.”</p>\n<p><em>Air Force Magazine</em> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.airforcemag.com/sole-purpose-policy-nuclear-posture-review-biden-wants-it-future/\">reported</a> last week that <strong>Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl</strong> said the current NPR maintains the U.S. policy of “flexible deterrence” but Biden hopes to eventually shift to “sole purpose,” or only having nuclear arms to deter or respond to an attack.</p>\n<p>Kahl—who was speaking at a side event of an ongoing United Nations conference about the nonproliferation of nuclear arms—also said that an unclassified version of the NPR will be released “in the relatively near future.”</p>\n<p>While encouraging Biden to hold off on his release until reviewing its proposals, Veterans for Peace, in the letter, also emphasized that the group’s members are “eager” to see his policy, especially considering how Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine and the response by Western powers have <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/08/06/extremely-concerned-shelling-europes-biggest-nuclear-power-plant-more-worrying\">ratcheted up</a> concerns of a nuclear conflict.</p>\n<p>“We deserve a full accounting of your nuclear planning,” VFP wrote. “We want to know what you and your advisers consider reasonable during this time of confrontation between the U.S. and Russia, which between them hold the lion’s share of the world’s 15,000 nuclear weapons.”</p>\n<p>The letter to Biden continues:</p>\n<p>We need to know if you will be keeping nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert. Will you forswear the first use of nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p>We need to know if you will rejoin the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, unilaterally abandoned by President George W.

But there is one exception to that generalization, though one hesitates to call it a benefit, consisting of the White House’s adoption of the Israel practice of referring to opponents as “terrorists.” Israel uses it as a generic cover designation to denigrate and humiliate the Palestinians while also delegitimizing their resistance, permitting them to torture and kill Arabs at will, destroy their homes, and bomb them mercilessly. Washington, which claims to be the font of a “rules based international order” as well as the defender of global “democracy” and “freedom,” has developed since 9/11 an unfortunate tendency to do the same thing as the Israelis to justify its attacks on civilians and its brutal assassination policies.</span></em></p>\n<p><span>In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-assasinations-illegal-not-held-accountable-why?fbclid=IwAR3lT2SwkqJms3x4tEOGLtjRgDWdh8KOV5YLVJW6fZzRbMMde54B3JqdpEg\">the US and Israel</a> are generally speaking the only two countries that openly use “targeted assassination” as a political tool without even bothering to fall back on “plausible denial” to conceal their actions. Israel only last week, initiated a politically motivated bombing attack on Gaza, which killed 45 civilians, including seventeen children and destroyed numerous homes.

The media coverage described how the Agency relentlessly stalked al-Zawahiri, described as the mastermind of 9/11, eventually learning that the 71-year-old was living in a house in an upscale Kabul neighborhood. It was also determined that he spent most days sitting on a terrace at the top of the house. The hellfire drone that killed him targeted the terrace at the time of day when he was normally sitting outside. Taliban sources report that his body was torn apart and incinerated by the two missiles that apparently struck him.</span></p>\n<p><span>The White House is, of course, framing the assassination as a great success, a major blow in the war against terror. <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is hoping that it will improve the administration’s dismal approval ratings in the lead-up to the November elections, but the information given to the media regarding the incident praising the CIA’s tenacity and professional expertise is perhaps a bit over the top. Alternative reports from Afghanistan suggest that al-Zawahiri was living quite openly in Kabul and that he has not been active in any presumably radical activities for many, many years <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">beyond making</a> a number of “conspiracy theory” videos. Both al-Zawahiri and al-Qaeda founder <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong> were, at the times when they were assassinated by the US, leading quiet lives with little protection even though they allegedly continued to be nominal leaders of al-Qaeda, an organization that had lost its <em>raison d’etre</em> years before.</span></p>\n<p><span>Al-Zawahiri’s record as a terrorist comes largely from US and UK intelligence sources as well as media innuendo, which should be automatically considered unreliable. Recall for a moment the lying that the George W. Bush administration engaged in to go to war with Iraq, with folks like Condoleezza Rice speaking of mushroom clouds spewing radiation over the US and a shop in the Pentagon run by a group of neocons producing fabricated intelligence reports. What has been confirmed from independent sources is that al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, was savagely tortured by the secret police during a crackdown on political dissidents initiated by US puppet <strong>President Hosni Mubarak</strong>. The torture reportedly radicalized him, and he joined Osama bin Laden’s underground group, later apparently becoming its nominal leader after bin Laden was himself killed in May 2011 by US Navy Seals. Much of the rest of al-Zawahiri’s presumed biography relies on little in the way of actual evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span>What actually happened on 9/11 and who was behind it remains somewhat a mystery as all the apparent perpetrators of which might have occurred are dead. Consider for a moment that Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri never actually admitted that their group al-Qaeda was the perpetrator of the attack. In fact they denied it, sometimes attributing it to other radicalized Saudi Arabian underground groups. Nor is there any actual evidence that they planned the attack. They were accused because they had the claimed track record, resources, motive and possible access to carry out the incident, not because there was any real evidence that they had done the deed. When the US approached the Taliban government of Afghanistan in late 2001 and demanded that bin Laden be turned over to American law enforcement, the Afghans responded that bin Laden was a guest in their country, but they would surrender him if Washington could demonstrate that he had organized and ordered the attacks. George W. Bush’s Pentagon and the CIA apparently could not make that case based on actual evidence, leading to the decision to go to war instead.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, of all the hundreds of “terrorist” prisoners that have been recycled through <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/al-qaeda-zawahiri-drone-death/\">the US military prison at Guantanamo</a> only five have ever been charged with any involvement in 9/11. They are still being held but have never been tried and it is quite possible the case against them can never be made. They might even be completely innocent.</span></p>\n<p><span>And there is more to the story. Bin Laden could have been arrested and tried but the Barack Obama administration decided to kill him and dump his body at sea, presumably to avoid a courtroom drama that would reveal government malfeasance. And then there are <strong>Anwar Nasser al-Awlaki</strong> and his son<strong> Abdulrahman</strong>, both of whom were American citizens killed by CIA drones in Yemen, where their family originated. The al-Awlakis may or may not have been actual members of al-Qaeda, but the elder al-Awlaki’s sermons and writings certainly inspired groups that opposed US foreign policy’s hostility towards Muslims. It is widely believed that Anwar al-Awlaki could have been captured and tried in the US if an attempt to do so had been pursued, but instead the Obama Administration again decided that he should be killed.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, there is the death by drone of Iranian <strong>General Qassem Soleimani</strong> in January 2000 under President Donald Trump. In a recent book, Trump’s Defense Chief <strong>Mark Esper</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-defense-chief-says-accused-164506911.html\">claims that</a> Trump lied after the assassination was criticized by saying that Soleimani was actively preparing “terror” attacks on four American Embassies in the Mideast region. Esper confirms that there was no intelligence to back up that claim, but interestingly goes beyond that to make clear that there was no specific intelligence at all suggesting that such an attack was imminent or even being planned. There were only generic regional security threats that many embassies in the world respond to and make preparations to defend against.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Esper claim is supported by the Iraqi government itself, which declared that Soleimani, widely regarded as the second most powerful official in Iran after the Ayatollah, was in Baghdad to discuss peace arrangements and that the US Embassy had been informed of his planned trip and had raised no objection to it. Instead, the US used the opportunity to launch an armed drone to kill him and nine Iraqi militia members that were accompanying him from the airport. In other words, there was no imminent threat, nor even a plausible threat, and the US went ahead anyway and killed a senior Iranian government official in a targeted assassination.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, the United States and Israel have a formula down pat whereby they can kill anyone anywhere without any due process or rule of law, even if they don’t know who you are as in the cases of the “signature” or “profile” executions by drone in Afghanistan. And all the presidents and senior officials know that no matter what they do there will be no accountability. All one has to do is call it terrorism prevention, which might include citing terrorist attacks that can in no way be linked by way of actual evidence to the person being killed. Once a terrorist, always a terrorist, repeat as needed, and the public and media will swoon with pleasure at being so well-protected. And, as the Israeli general described it, the end result will be “really clean, very nice” an “exceptional achievement.”</span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Instead, he claimed, the bill simply closes a loophole that allows corporations to avoid paying all the taxes they owe. Despite what Senator Manchin says, the fact is the new minimum tax increases the amount of money some corporations must hand over to the government; in other words, it increases their taxes.</em></p>\n<p>It is common for politicians, policy wonks, and even some libertarians to demonize loopholes for making the tax system too complex, but loopholes are simply ways that individuals can keep more of their money. Loopholes are thus pro-liberty and pro-sound economics.</p>\n<p>In addition to raising taxes, the Inflation Reduction Act provides 80 billion dollars to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Some of the money will go to improving taxpayer services so, for example, taxpayers may actually talk to a real person who can provide information about the tax law when they call the agency. But, over 50 percent will be spent on enforcement.</p>\n<p>The IRS is expected to hire approximately 87,000 new agents. Supporters of the expansion say the IRS will use the enhanced enforcement capacity to target only “the rich.” However, it is not necessary to massively increase the IRS’s enforcement capacity just to go after “rich tax cheats.”</p>\n<p>Furthermore, rich people and big corporations can hire attorneys and accountants to make sure they limit their tax liability while staying within the legal limits. They can also fight any attempt by the IRS to make them pay more. Middle- and working-class Americans are unable to afford legions of attorneys and accountants to limit their tax liability or fight the IRS, so they are more likely to pay whatever the IRS demands.</p>\n<p>The IRS has a history of disrespecting due process rights of Americans, so creating a new army of IRS agents with a mission to extract more money will lead to massive liberties violations. Given the IRS’s shameful history of harassing the political enemies of whoever holds power at the moment, we should expect the new agents to target opponents of US foreign policy, gun control, government promotion of green energy, and other policies of the current administration.</p>\n<p>The IRS recently ran an ad seeking agents who are willing to carry a firearm and use deadly force. This comes after the tax agency’s purchase this year of 700,000 dollars worth of ammunition. Perhaps the agency is worried that the latest attempt to get more taxes from Americans already suffering from the inflation tax will lead to violence, or perhaps the IRS wants its agents to carry firearms to remind taxpayers that the tax laws are backed by the threat of government violence.</p>\n<p>The premise behind the income tax is that the government is the true owner of all property and thus has the right to take as much from the people as it desires. Therefore, the income tax, like the other monstrosity created in 1913 — the Federal Reserve, is incompatible with a free society but necessary for an authoritarian welfare-warfare state. To avoid 1984, repeal 1913.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.
