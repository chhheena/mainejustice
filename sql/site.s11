create “<em>learning sets</em>” for the AI machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Supplementing this smarter automated detection with human expertise to review edge cases and identify false positives and negatives and then feeding those findings back into training sets will allow us to create AI with human intelligence baked in,</em>” Goldberger stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n[embedded

trust and safety teams can help the AI with anomalous cases, allowing it to detect nuances in content that a purely automated system might otherwise miss or misinterpret, according to Goldberger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>A human moderator who is an expert in European white supremacy won’t necessarily be able to recognize harmful content in India or misinformation narratives in Kenya</em>,” she explained. As time goes on and the AI practices with more learning sets, it begins to identify the kinds of content moderating teams would find offensive, reaching “<em>near-perfect detection”</em> at a massive scale,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldberger said the system would protect against “<em>increasingly advanced actors misusing platforms in unique ways.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trust and safety teams at online media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, bring a “<em>nuanced comprehension of disinformation campaigns”</em> that they apply to content moderation, said Goldberger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes working with government organizations to filter content communicating a narrative about COVID-19, for example. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Big Tech companies on what types of content to label as misinformation on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media companies have also targeted conservative content, including posts that negatively portray abortion and transgender activism, or contradict the mainstream understanding of climate change, by either labeling them as “<em>misinformation</em>” or blocking them entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WEF document did not specify how members of the AI training team would be decided, how they would be held accountable or whether countries could exercise controls over the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elite business executives who participate in WEF gatherings have a track record of proposals that expand corporate control over peoples’ lives. At the latest WEF annual summit, in March, the head of the Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group boasted of a system for monitoring individual carbon footprints derived from eating, travel and similar behaviors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The future is built by us, by a powerful community such as you here in this room,</em>” WEF founder and chairman Klaus Schwab told an audience of more than 2,500 global business and political elites.</p>\n\n                         <div><div><section><div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/baxter/\" title=\"Baxter Dmitry\"><img alt=\"Baxter Dmitry\" src=\"https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg.optimal.jpg\" width=\"80\" /></a></div><div><h3><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/baxter/\">Baxter Dmitry</a></h3><div>Baxter Dmitry is a writer at News Punch.

an “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/07/06/watch-police-open-fire-on-threatening-dutch-farmer-protest/\">unavoidable transition</a>“, the Dutch government has seemingly committed itself to killing off many farming businesses in its own country for the sake of appeasing green agenda nitrogen reduction targets set by Eurocrats in Brussels.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>However, while those in the government’s cabinet seem steadfast in doing the work ordered by the European Union, other politicians — including some of those within the parties of the country’s ruling coalition — have challenged the move.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nieuweoogst.nl/nieuws/2022/08/09/christenunie-waarom-gaat-stikstofkaart-niet-van-tafel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a> by farming magazine <em>Nieuwe Oogst</em>, some<strong> MPs have expressed disbelief at the number of farms that will be forced to close under the nitrogen reduction measures,</strong> with the Christian Democratic Alliance (CDA) even saying that it believes the official numbers to have been an error in communication with the government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Or is it indeed the case that 11,200 farmers will have to stop until 2030, just because of the nitrogen policy?” a letter from the party asks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And what are the consequences of this gigantic contraction on the amount of food produced in the Netherlands?” the document sent to the minister also reportedly reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Reformed Political Party (SGP) probed the government as to how planned farm closures are to occur, with official documents seemingly pointing to the mandatory buy-outs being used by the government to close businesses in the country by force to meet its Great Reset objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <em>Nieuwe Oogst</em> reports that the government has ostensibly been looking at ways of making sure that farm closures are as voluntary as possible, the SGP claims that official documents earmarking funds for the projects appear to indicate that targets will be achieved mainly via forced purchases if the government indeed aims to hit is nitrogen reduction aims by 2030.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The party has now asked for the government to clarify how it aims to make sure that as many farm closures as possible are indeed voluntary.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n

repeating the exact same scripted lines suggests the public are being force-fed government propaganda about the FBI raid. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Which raises the question, what do they have to hide and why are they so determined to make everybody see the event in the same way? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is mind-control in action. There is a reason they are called programs and programming. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not the first time the media has been caught parroting from the same propaganda script.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you surprised?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1949 a CIA director called Frank Wisner was given a task to create an organization responsible for the manipulation of media and direct action in the United States and other countries around the world. This operation would be known as Mockingbird.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The justification for Operation Mockingbird was to fight against Communism. But as often happens with government programs, the stated objective and the reality of what the program is used for do not always align. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CIA would go on to hire many top journalists working for big mainstream media outlets to further their cause. But they did not stop there. They also hired many students and foreign journalists as well. Anything to stop the threat of Communism. And, increasingly, influence public opinion in other ways too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CIA even funded Hollywood films. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we can sit here and argue about the ethics of an operation like Mockingbird, there is no argument about its effectiveness. Mockingbird was incredibly effective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operation Mockingbird was a large-scale program of the CIA that began in the early years of the Cold War and attempted to manipulate domestic American news media organizations for propaganda purposes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CIA was able to implement a mass media manipulation system, allowing them to control their narrative, while censoring those they did not like, as long as it was in a company in their control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huge media companies that controlled vast swathes of the American media landscape including CBS, Time Magazine, The New York Times, and the Washington Post, were all on the bankroll of the CIA – and directly under their control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Operation Mockingbird was able to operate secretly for many years, they could not stay in the shadows forever. In 1964, David Wise and Thomas B. Ross published a book called “The Invisible Government.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book blew the lid on CIA covert activities and how the agency operated. Then just two years later, Ramparts published the first expose of Mockingbird.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sol Stern, the writer of the expose, describes the experience: “Until the Ramparts story broke, the government could count on the Mandarins of Washington journalism to protect national-security secrets. But as details of the front groups spilled out, editorials in the Times and the Post skewed the secret funding arrangement and compared it with methods used by America’s Cold War enemies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CIA was beginning to feel the heat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Watergate scandal drew the attention of the public onto America’s many agencies. This led to many investigations, most notably the Church Hearing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1975, a US Senator by the name of Frank Church set up a committee forever known as the Church committee. CIA Director William Colby was called in for a hearing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Church committee would go on to release various reports exposing the CIA, leading to public outrage about their actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next year George H.W. Bush, who was the new CIA Director, publicly ended the CIA’s relationship with the media, stating “The CIA will not enter into any paid or contractual relationship with any full or part-time news correspondent accredited by any United States news service, newspaper, periodical, radio or television network of station.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps that is why CNN are listed as “Entertainment” and not “News”? Just a thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, the scary fact is that mainstream media is a cesspool of manipulation and thought control and 99% of people have no clue about what is going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think it was bad in the 1960s and 70s, you need to get yourself up to speed because in 2012 Obama reversed the Smith-Mundt Act, meaning domestic audiences can <em>again</em> be targeted by government propaganda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Propaganda and fake news have been a hot topic since then, especially since media favorite Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are wondering what Obama’s handiwork looks like in practice, consider this Exhibit A for the prosecution:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n[embedded content]\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The poet W.H. Auden summed it up best.

products that have been artifically sweetened are a healthier option than regular sugar. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>However nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/artificial-sweeteners-obesity-diabetes-cancer-cola/\">The Defender </a>reports: Over the years, an ever-growing number of studies have shown <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/artificial-sweeteners-liver-damage/\">artificial sweeteners</a> raise your risk of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes — perhaps even to a greater degree than sugar does. One example is an <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-care-news/articles/2018-04-23/study-artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-diabetes-obesity\">animal study</a>, presented at the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://plan.core-apps.com/eb2018/abstract/382e0c7eb95d6e76976fbc663612d58a\">2018 Experimental Biology</a> conference in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study, which explored how different sweeteners affect the way food is used and stored in the body, and how they affect vascular functioning, found both sugar and artificial sweeteners result in impairments, albeit through different pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being fed a diet high in either artificial sweeteners (aspartame or acesulfame potassium) or sugars (glucose or fructose) for three weeks, detrimental effects were seen in all groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All had increased blood lipids (fats), but the artificial sweeteners also accumulated in the blood of the animals, which harmed the blood vessel lining to a greater degree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results indicate that artificial sweeteners alter how your body processes fat and produces energy at the cellular level. So, while operating on completely different chemical pathways, they produce the same kinds of health consequences as sugar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The latest fad: fortified artificial sweeteners</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite such evidence, the artificial sweetener market continues to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As reported by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/11/Merisant-teams-with-Amazon-accelerator-to-expand-appeal-of-Equal-with-two-new-sweetener-lines\">Food Navigator</a>, Merisant launched a new zero-calorie sweetener called Sugarly Sweet exclusively on Amazon in late January 2019 and has also created a line of artificial sweeteners fortified with vitamins and minerals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fortified sweeteners are sold under the company’s Equal Plus brand, and are available in three versions: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.equal.com/products/equal-plus-c/\">vitamin C and zinc</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.equal.com/products/equal-plus-b/\">vitamins B3, B5 and B12</a>, or <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.equal.com/products/equal-plus-a/\">vitamins C and E</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The products are marketed as a “good source” of these nutrients, as a single packet provides 10% of the daily recommended value of the added vitamins and minerals. E.G. Fishburne, director of Merisant marketing in North America, told <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2019/02/11/Merisant-teams-with-Amazon-accelerator-to-expand-appeal-of-Equal-with-two-new-sweetener-lines\">Food Navigator</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Consumers are looking to get more out of their foods, including more vitamins and nutrients, and that hasn’t really permeated into the sweetener space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So, we thought it was a natural fit with someone adding a sweetener to their coffee or beverage in the morning. Why not have that added benefit of getting a good source of a vitamin in that as well?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, just because something sounds like a good idea doesn’t mean it actually is, and that’s certainly the case here. The added vitamins and minerals do absolutely nothing to change the artificial sweetener’s detrimental impact on your health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The metabolic effects of zero-calorie sweeteners</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to realize that while <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856475/\">artificial sweeteners</a> have no (or very few) calories, they are still metabolically active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As explained in the 2016 paper, “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4661066/\">Metabolic Effects of Non-Nutritive Sweeteners</a>,” many studies have linked artificial sweeteners to an increased risk for obesity, insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper presents three mechanisms by which artificial sweeteners promote metabolic dysfunction:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>They interfere with learned responses that contribute to glucose control and energy homeostasis</li><li>They destroy gut microbiota and induce glucose intolerance</li><li>They interact with sweet-taste receptors expressed throughout the digestive system that plays a role in glucose absorption and trigger insulin secretion</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the sweet taste receptors on your tongue, you also have sweet taste receptors in your gut, which release signaling molecules into your bloodstream in response to sweet taste, thereby triggering your pancreas to release insulin in preparation for a glucose spike (which is what would happen if you ate sugar).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the artificial sweetener basically tricks your body into storing fat by raising your insulin level, even though the sugar never arrives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Artificial sweeteners are toxic to gut bacteria</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial sweeteners also have effects on your gut microbiome that are significantly different from sugar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While sugar is detrimental because it tends to feed health-harming microbes, artificial sweeteners could easily be considered the worst of the two, as they have been shown to be downright toxic to gut bacteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2008 study, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=PubMed&cmd=Search&TransSchema=title&term=Journal+of+toxicology+and+environmental+health.+Part+A%5BJour%5D+AND+2008%5Bpdat%5D+AND+splenda\">sucralose (Splenda)</a> was shown to reduce gut bacteria by as much as 50%, preferentially targeting bacteria known to have important human health benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consuming as few as seven little Splenda packets may be enough to have a detrimental effect on your gut microbiome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the countless side effects associated with an impaired gut microbiome, sucralose has also been linked to a wide variety of other health effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, according to Cleveland Clinic, when <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/is-sucralose-splenda-bad-for-you/\">Splenda</a> upsets the microbiome, it also leads to increased inflammation, which then “can contribute to a variety of problems, including obesity and diabetes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recent research has confirmed and expanded these findings, showing that all currently approved artificial sweeteners disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The animal study, published in the journal Molecules in October 2018, found aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, neotame, advantame and acesulfame potassium-k all <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/10/2454\">cause DNA damage</a> in, and interfere with, the normal and healthy activity of gut bacteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all six artificial sweeteners were found to have toxic effects on gut bacteria, there were individual differences in the type and amount of damage they produced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Saccharin caused the greatest, most widespread damage, exhibiting both cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, meaning it is toxic to cells and damages genetic information in the cell (which can cause mutations).</li><li>Neotame was found to cause metabolic disruption in mice and raised concentrations of several fatty acids, lipids and cholesterol. Several gut genes were also decreased by this sweetener.</li><li>Aspartame and acesulfame potassium-k were both found to cause DNA damage. Acesulfame potassium-k is commonly found in sports supplements.</li></ul>\n\n                         <!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->', 'https://newspunch.com/artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-serious-health-problems-including-diabetes-obesity/', 'News Punch', '2022-08-13 12:16:10', 'YTowOnt9', '3bb1137cebff07b134540123f9358557e3e41a66', '0', '0', '0'),

Texas. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ducey said he had tried to convince the White House to do more to help Arizona, but has been left convinced that the Biden administration has no interest in stemming the flow of illegals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘<em>For the last two years, Arizona has made every attempt to work with Washington to address the crisis on our border</em>,’ he continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘<em>Time and

for the Republican governor, Doug Ducey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state plans to fill three gaps in the border wall constructed during former President Donald Trump’s tenure in the coming weeks, totaling 3,000 feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The federal government has committed to doing this, but we cannot wait for their action,’ Ratlief said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Mennell, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said the agency had just learned of Arizona’s action and ‘is not prepared to comment at this time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move is the latest pushback by a Republican-led border state to what they contend is inaction by Joe Biden on immigration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was immediately prompted by the announcement of the end of the ‘Remain in Mexico’ program that was announced this week, Ducey’s top lawyer, Annie Foster said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That program required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico and await a court date, although thousands of migrants who made it into the country were not returned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arizona has been sending two to three buses of asylum seekers from Yuma to Washington over the last three months to make a political statement as the number of arriving migrants overwhelmed local resources. </p>\n\n                         <div><div><section><div><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newspunch.com/author/baxter/\" title=\"Baxter

America’s chaotic and ill-advised withdrawal from Afghanistan took place more than 7,000 miles from Washington, D.C., but it was a direct byproduct of bad decisions made by politicians in the Beltway. <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/14/michael-mccaul-biden-administation-afghanistan-withdrawal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(RELATED: ‘Many Sins’: Congressman Destroys Biden A Year After Botched Afghanistan Withdrawal)</a></strong></p><p>Although the episode has faded from the headlines, we must never lose sight of its ramifications, which destabilized a region and gave a foothold to those who wish us harm.</p><p>As a retired brigadier general who served 33 years in the Army, including 10 tours in Afghanistan, this is deeply personal for me. I had the privilege of commanding thousands of troops, including 72 who did not make it home.  Honoring their sacrifice — and their families’ — are my “why” for service.</p><div readability=\"121.92748778606\"> <p>Even the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/politics/joe-biden-counter-terrorism/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">death of Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, one of the masterminds of the Sep. 11 attacks and leader of al-Qaida since Osama bin Laden’s demise, came with a major caveat. Yes, it’s good news this monster received justice. But a feeble 71-year-old should never have felt safe enough to hide in plain sight in downtown Kabul.</p> <p>Terrorists have free reign in Afghanistan. ISIS has begun targeting the Shia minority population, a community routinely subject to persecution, but where violence had subsided with an American military presence. Other hostile nations can send would-be terrorists to Afghanistan for training.</p> <p>While the botched withdrawal hurt Biden’s political standing, none of its enablers have answered for their actions. The buck stops with the commander-in-chief, and he should have cleaned house. His secretaries of State, Defense, National Security adviser and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the chairman, should have resigned or been removed.</p> <p>Instead, the same cast of characters remain in their respective positions.</p> <p>During my tenure as Joint Staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Aide to the Secretary of the Army, I regularly briefed high level government officials, including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and president of the United States, who was Barack Obama at the time. I told them what they needed to hear, not what they wanted to hear, even if it ruffled feathers.</p> <p>I made it clear that Obama’s withdrawal plan announced in December 2014 was the wrong move. It was the playbook his then-vice president, Joe Biden, picked up and finished seven years later.</p> <p>Instead of leading an international effort that would leave a limited number of U.S. servicemembers behind to support the Afghan government and push back on al-Qaida and ISIS, Biden unilaterally withdrew all our troops to meet an arbitrary political deadline.</p> <p>We abandoned the brave Afghans who risked their lives to help us combat the terrorist extremists. Many are now stranded or hiding, fearful for their lives. They took a major risk to stand with us and were shamefully abandoned for their efforts. The Biden administration has not done enough to ease the resettlement process.</p> <p>To be sure, America’s military presence in Afghanistan needed to end. We had been there too long, and it was time for the Afghan government to stand up on its own. But that does not justify what happened, as you’re likely to hear defenders of the Biden administration try to argue in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Going forward, Afghanistan must be treated as a the terrorist state that it has become. It should be isolated in every way possible. The U.S. should work through the United Nations to admonish China, Iran, Russia, North Korea and anyone else who tries to conduct business with the Taliban.</p> <p>The Afghan people deserve better than the Taliban, Al Qaeda and ISIS-K. We must support regional security. We also need to get tougher with Pakistan and support India’s efforts to undermine China. Otherwise, terrorist organizations are going to proliferate and the odds of further attacks on the U.S. will increase.</p> <p>While corporate media fawns over Biden’s “winning” streak, remember his failed leadership weakened America and emboldened our enemies. One year may have passed, but we — and our allies — will be paying the consequences for years to come.</p> <p><em>Don Bolduc is a retired Brigadier General and Republican candidate for United States Senate in New Hampshire</em></p> <p><em>The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.</em></p> <p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Our formal appeal to Google was, of course, turned down, so WND is permanently banned by the world’s main internet gatekeeper.</p>\n<p>But why, you might ask, would the Google “Goliath” be so maniacally intent on killing the WND “David,” a small, Christian journalism operation that somehow refuses to die, despite continual attacks from all sides?</p>\n<p>And yes, I do mean “maniacally.” Google doesn’t hold back in telling us exactly what it finds “dangerous,” “derogatory,” “misrepresentative,” “unreliable” and “harmful” – their words – about our 25-year-old pioneering independent news website. Check this out:</p>\n<p>“We do not allow content,” the Google overlords exhort us, “that incites hatred against, promotes discrimination of, or disparages an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.”</p>\n<p>Of course, all this pained moralizing over “hatred” and “discrimination” toward people who are military veterans, disabled, elderly and so on is idiotic. No one hates or discriminates against veterans, the disabled or the elderly. That’s camouflage. What Google <i>really</i> wants to protect from any criticism or opposing viewpoint is “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” Indeed, when as a news organization WND dares to report honestly and forthrightly on the fantastically deranged transgender agenda – where beautiful American children from coast to coast are indoctrinated, seduced, groomed, recruited and enabled to “transition to a different gender” by taking puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and even undergoing double mastectomies and castration – when WND sounds the alarm over any of this, which we do daily, Google sees that as “inciting hatred” and “promoting discrimination.”</p>\n<p>How about: We’re defending and protecting the most innocent, helpless and precious among us – the children who will make up America’s next generation? That’s not “hatred”; it sounds more like love.</p>\n<p>There’s more. Google tells WND it does “not allow content that … promotes harmful health claims, or relates to a current major health crisis and contradicts authoritative scientific consensus.”</p>\n<p>Translation: When we report knowledgeably and truthfully on the Biden administration’s absolutely deranged and tyrannical mismanagement of the COVID pandemic – from imposing vaccine mandates that have thrown tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors, Marines, nurses, paramedics, police, firemen and other frontline heroes (including my own son) out of work, to suppressing inexpensive, effective and readily available early outpatient treatment of COVID, to pretending “natural immunity” isn’t real even though at least 92 studies <i>prove</i> it’s superior to vaccine immunity, to insisting that infants and toddlers be needlessly injected with the experimental and hazardous mRNA “vaccines” – well, such reporting as ours is simply not allowed. Only the official Biden narrative – you know, the one based on massive lying, and which failed at every turn to end the pandemic, while driving up suicide, addiction, overdose deaths, depression and crime rates across the nation, and introduced a level of authoritarianism never before seen in America – is allowed.</p>\n<p>But let’s dig a little deeper. Let’s venture beneath Google’s “woke” moralizing about all the “marginalized” and “underserved communities” WND is “discriminating against,” and how we’re spreading dangerous “misinformation,” “disinformation” and “conspiracy theories,” even though we are simply reporting the provable (and often <em>obvious</em>) truth. Let’s dare to confront what is <i>really</i> bugging Google, and exactly WHY the super-rich mega-monopoly (and the rest of the Big Tech oligarchs) have been so maniacally intent on taking down little WND and making sure you are never able to read it again.</p>\n<p>Though disguised as high-minded moral concern over “accurate and beneficial information,” what we’re really contending with is a worldview in total thrall to exceedingly dark forces, a worldview that lusts after power and glory and worship, one that ignores Reality at every turn, while manifesting an abiding contempt for biology, for the lessons of history, for the fundamental laws of economics, for the transcendent value of human life, and especially, for Almighty God and His laws.</p>\n<p>That’s what we’re REALLY dealing with. That’s what is trying to take us down.</p>\n<p>Again, we’re not talking only about Google. YouTube (owned by Google) has permanently de-monetized WND’s channel. Facebook has massively suppressed WND’s traffic on its platform, by up to 90%. Three major online ad companies (TripleLift, AppNexus/Xander and Teads) have all canceled WND, seriously hurting our revenues. Why? Because of our supposed “hate speech” – that’s what they call it when you uphold basic biblical morality. Then there’s the Southern Poverty Law Center, the hateful leftwing extremist group that Big Tech relies on to identify hateful extremist groups, which – naturally – classifies WND as a hateful “extremist group.” Apparently, your favorite news site specializes in “manipulative fear-mongering and outright fabrications designed to further the paranoid, gay-hating, conspiratorial and apocalyptic visions … from the fringes of the far-right and fundamentalist worlds.” In other words, we’re conservative and Christian.</p>\n<p>So, in light of this daunting reality facing us, what can we do?</p>\n<p>Futurist George Gilder wrote a stunning book called “Life After Google,” providing an insightful and ultimately hopeful view of what the Internet could be in a future era when the Big Tech oligarch tyrants finally lose their monopoly control. Will that ever happen? I honestly don’t know.</p>\n<p>But if I may, I’d like to ask you to help WND be part of our own version of Life After Google right now! With Big Tech doing everything possible to extinguish us, we need an alternate source of financial support. And that, dear friends, would be you – you who appreciate and value WND, who love and cherish the same things we do – our God, our country, our Judeo-Christian values and culture. Everything that once made America great, or as President Reagan liked to put it, “a shining city on a hill.”</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://wndnewscenter.nationbuilder.com/support_wnd_news_center\">Kindly consider stepping up and helping us REPLACE GOOGLE (and all the other super-wealthy tech entities suppressing and de-monetizing us) with a more fitting and reliable source of support and sustenance in these extremely challenging times.</a></p>\n<p>The truth is, we are always struggling to make payroll, while fending off the continual stream of new attacks, crises, lawsuits, misfortunes, hacks, demands and threats directed our way.

Multiple ways, he explained.</p>\n<p>Most recently are the allegations created by the Biden Department of Justice regarding the Espionage Act of 1917 against Trump, which was the basis for an FBI raid of Trump’s home.</p>\n<p>Trump supporters have bluntly stated it was a fishing trip hunting for anything that could be used to discourage Trump from running for office in 2024, as he’s the leading GOP candidate for president even before announcing.</p>\n<p>Democrats already have staged two failed attempts at impeaching him and removing him from office, and also have a Democrat-run House committee investigating Jan. 6, which so far has failed to alter the political landscape in America.</p>\n<p>Dershowitz explained, “In the past, many leftist civil libertarians have railed against the breadth and scope of this [Espionage] law, calling it repressive and unconstitutionally vague. Among the people who were prosecuted, indicted or investigated under the Espionage Act are progressive icons such as socialists Eugene V. Debs and Charles Schenk, antiwar activists Daniel Ellsberg and Dr. Benjamin Spock, whistleblowers Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning, anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, as well as many others who made unpopular speeches, engaged in protests or took other actions deemed unpatriotic by the government.”</p>\n<p>But, he said, now the “shoe is on the other foot.”</p>\n<p>“Now that the same law is being deployed against a possible presidential candidate they deplore — many of these same leftists are demanding that this accordion-like law be expanded to fit Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified material. The ACLU, which has repeatedly challenged the constitutionality and applicability of the Espionage Act to anti-government activities by left-wing radicals, is strangely silent when the same overbroad law is deployed against a political figure whose politics they deplore.”</p>\n<p>Dershowitz explained the “same double standard” was evident during the FBI’s search of Trump’s home.</p>\n<p>“Many civil libertarians have complained about the overuse of search warrants in situations where a ‘less intrusive’ and narrower subpoena would suffice. Even U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged that the policy of the Justice Department is to use measures less intrusive than a full-blown search whenever possible. Yet he did not explain why a day-long search of Trump’s home was necessary, especially since a subpoena had been issued and could have been judicially enforced if the government was dissatisfied with the progress of negotiations. Again, silence from the ACLU and other left-wing civil libertarians.”</p>\n<p>And, he said, it’s not just Trump in the cross-hairs.</p>\n<p>“Then there is the manner by which Trump loyalists have been treated when they were indicted. Several have been arrested, handcuffed and shackled, despite not having been charged with crimes of violence and despite the absence of evidence that they were planning to flee. In my long experience, most other comparable defendants are simply notified of the charges and ordered to appear in court. Yet despite this apparent double standard, the left has been silent.”</p>\n<p>He suggested Garland’s standard now suggests, “Due process for me but not for thee.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps the most glaring manifestation of the double standard currently at work is the different approach taken to the alleged mishandling of classified material by Trump, on the one hand, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, on the other hand. No wide-ranging search warrants were sought for Clinton’s home, where private servers were apparently kept and subpoenaed material even possibly destroyed,” he pointed out.</p>\n<p>There never have been any prosecutions for that “comparable mishandling” of classified information.</p>\n<p>The idea of “one standard of civil liberties” appears to have gone missing “from recent attempts to ‘get’ Trump and his loyalists,” he said.</p>\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.
