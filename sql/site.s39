An unelected shadow government consisting of billionaires, multinational corporations, and international non-governmental organizations like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Economic Forum</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/funding/contributors/the-rockefeller-foundation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rockefeller Foundation</a> has seized power without a shot being fired, without a drop of blood being shed. </em></p>\n<p><em>All nations have been corrupted. Elected officials, public health authorities, and the mainstream media can no longer be trusted. Phony pandemics like COVID-19 along with the fear of AIDS, monkeypox, and whatever else they can dream up are being used as an excuse to replace freedom, democracy, and national sovereignty with a global dystopian surveillance state. Welcome to the abyss.</em></p>\n<p>The majority of people go about their lives wrapped in a cocoon of complacency and indifference, blissfully unaware of the fate that awaits them if they don’t wake up. Instead, they either flat out deny reality or fritter away their time on trivial issues as well as major issues while failing to see the big picture.</p>\n<p>Some sit on their mystic futons with their <a href=\"https://meanings.crystalsandjewelry.com/quartz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quartz crystals</a> and think happy thoughts while others go on moral crusades freaking themselves out over children at drag shows, transsexuals in bathrooms, and people who didn’t get a COVID jab, while still others absorb themselves with sports, celebrity gossip, and wondering if <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeffrey Epstein</a> is still alive. But that’s the whole idea. Distract the masses. In ancient Rome it was bread and circuses, now it’s pandemics, transsexuals, and cell phones.</p>\n<p>But the big picture remains. “Vaccine Passports Are Here to Stay. Why Worry?” declares a January 2022 <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/01/01/covid-vaccine-passports-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> in The Intercept.</p>\n<p>The article goes on to point out that there is a whole lot to worry about along with a February 2022 <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-02-vaccine-passports-surveillance-guise-health.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article </a>in Medical X Press, and another February 2022 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2022/02/24/national-vaccine-quietly-rolled-out/?sh=482fb2a46be6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> in Forbes. This is because even though COVID-19 restrictions are being lifted, they are not totally gone and could come back in full force with a vengeance. The corrupt system that put them there is still in place.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Image on the right is from Mercola</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/rise-utilitarian-extremism-how-recognize-it/5744872/vaccine-passport-3\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5744875\"><img class=\" wp-image-5744875 alignright\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vaccine-passport.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"343\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vaccine-passport.jpg 380w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/vaccine-passport-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\"></a></p>\n<p>Examples: a number of countries and some US states have rolled out vaccine passports.</p>\n<p>Other US states have banned vaccine passports, but could easily reintroduce them down the road. The Federal Government could also start pressuring the states to require vaccine passports or pass a federal law requiring them nationwide.</p>\n<p>Even though the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Biden’s vaccine requirement for large companies, many, as CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/business/employer-vaccine-mandates/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported,</a> are still requiring COVID jabs for their employees. This is because the Court didn’t use an across-the-board ban as it should have. Also consider China’s <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150456/shanghai-maintains-zero-covid-policy-but-the-u-n-says-it-is-not-sustainable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zero-COVID policy</a> in Shanghai that brutally locked down 24.9 million people.</p>\n<p>Examples: CNN <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/18/politics/cdc-mask-mandate-ruling/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> that some airports and subway systems like in New York are still requiring masks even though a Federal District Judge struck down Biden’s mask mandate for transportation because it doesn’t apply to corporate and state entities. The judge could have gotten rid of all mask mandates across-the-board. But on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/read-cdc-mask-mandate-ruling/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">page 43</a> of the decision she states that the Court accepts the CDC’s determination that masks are effective against COVID-19, which they aren’t. In my state, COVID restrictions are gone, but hospitals and medical offices are still requiring masks. LA County in California is <a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-county-covid-mask-mandate/2936528/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">threatening</a> to bring back mask mandates due to rising COVID cases. No people, this nonsense isn’t over by a long shot.</p>\n<p>There are some who think that whatever their globalist masters do to them is just peachy dandy. There are too many who will just go along to get along because they’re too lazy and too scared to fight back. Let’s not forget those who expect to be rewarded for selling out the human race. And there are a growing number of those who want to do all they can to resist, but are tempted to kick-back and chill-out. So, let’s look at what these globalist masters of the universe have planned for us and what could go wrong if they get their way.</p>\n<h2><strong>Foreboding Planet</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the greatest science fiction movies ever made was the 1956 classic <a href=\"https://ok.ru/video/406636727024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Forbidden </a><a href=\"https://ok.ru/video/406636727024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Planet.”</a> It is considered by many to be the granddaddy of all science fiction films. Like Star Trek, the film is set in the distant future. The <a href=\"https://www.liquisearch.com/forbidden_planet/plot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plot:</a> an Earth starship travels to a remote planet that a research team of scientists landed on 20 years earlier to see what became of them. Turns out only one scientist and his sexy daughter who was born there survived. They are living comfortably in a beautiful house with a robot that the father created to serve their every need. But soon after the ship lands, an indestructible invisible monster starts killing the ship’s crew. The scientist explained that this monster also killed all his other colleagues except for his wife, who died of natural causes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The captain rightly decides to get off the planet pronto. But the scientist doesn’t want to leave, assures him that he and his daughter are in no danger, and insists that the ship leave without them. He explains that a highly advanced civilization once existed there that was mysteriously wiped out two hundred thousand years earlier. Nothing remains above ground. But underground is a huge laboratory and miles and miles of a vast underground machine complex that maintains itself so it looks brand new.</p>\n<p>He tells the captain how our civilization would benefit from the wonders he has discovered, but that only he is qualified to dole out the knowledge because he boosted his intellect with one of their machines which almost killed him because it wasn’t made for our primitive ape brain. But even with his boosted intellect he can’t figure out why this civilization which was on the verge of some enormous achievement suddenly vanished overnight. But the ship’s doctor figures it out after he sneaks into the underground lab and boosts his intellect to an even greater degree. It kills him, but before he dies he explains what went wrong.</p>\n<p>Turns out the vast machine complex allowed every inhabitant of the ancient civilization to become mentally connected to it so that anything they imagined would instantly materialize. In other words, they would have the power of God: creation by mere thought. But as the doctor explained, they forgot about one thing: “Monsters from the <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/psyche.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ID</a>.” Like us, they evolved from more primitive ancestors and the machine freed those violent primitive impulses to maim and kill. The scientist was forced to face the fact that the monster that killed his companions and that was now about to kill his daughter because she fell in love with the captain was his own subconscious let loose when his intellect was expanded. He had no power to stop it. But the stress of discovering the truth killed him–his daughter and everyone else were saved.</p>\n<p><strong>We have seen many times that science fiction eventually becomes science fact.</strong> Like the vast fictitious  machine complex in “Forbidden Planet,” the internet is everywhere and anyone can connect to it via their computers and smart phones. But the architects of the New World Order, the Great Reset, call it what you will, want to implant chips into our bodies and or brain that will allow us to connect to the internet without the aforementioned devices. They will sell it to us as being fun and convenient. Don’t be fooled. Their agenda is total control of the human race.</p>\n<p>If you think I’m spouting some wild conspiracy theory, think again. The technology to implant computer chips in people exists now, has been done, and is being done as shown in this 2019 NBC News <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ksw-arKvMPk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report.</a> One of the guys interviewed said he thinks chipping will be voluntary. It might start out that way, but it won’t stay that way. In this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHJYWLLYzKQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video,</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schwab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Klaus Schwab</strong>,</a> head of the World Economic Forum declares:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Can you imagine that in 10 years when we are sitting here we have an implant in our brains and I can immediately feel, because <strong>you all will have implants, </strong>I can measure your brain waves and I can immediately tell you how the people react or I can see you, how the people react to your answers.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Notice all of the I statements Schwab made? It’s all about what he can do and in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1SpC3B1KyM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> asserts:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“What the Fourth Industrial Revolution will lead to is <strong>a fusion of our physical, our digital, and our biological identities.”  </strong></p>\n<p>What Schwab said is confirmed in this <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> on the World Economic Forum’s website:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before…The Fourth Industrial Revolution, finally, will change not only what we do but also who we are. It will affect our identity and all issues associated with it…and sooner than we think it may lead to human augmentation.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yuval Noah Harari,</a></strong> PhD, is a best selling author, historian, and a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Some right wing conservative websites claim that Professor Harari is a top adviser to Klaus Schwab. I have found no evidence for that claim. Yes, he has spoke at the World Economic Forum’s annual meetings in Davos, Switzerland as well as with billionaire globalists like Bill Gates. But as Dr. Harari explained in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVTf-C6oQo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview</a> on 60 Minutes, his purpose is to warn the elites of the dangers of what they are doing. And they are open to being warned because “they are a bit afraid of their own  power” and “have realized the immense influence they have over the world, over the course of  evolution really and I think that spooks at least some of them and that’s a good thing.”</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the 2020 annual Davos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG6WnMb9Fho\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">meeting,</a> Dr. Harari laid out the scary and creepy future that globalists like Schwab have planned for us via the use of <a href=\"https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/biotechnology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">biotechnology: </a></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“In the coming decades AI and biotechnology will give us god-like abilities to re-engineer life and even to create completely new life forms. After 4 billion years of organic life shaped by natural selection we are about to enter a new era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Our intelligent design is going to be the new driving force of the evolution of life. And in using these powers of creation we might make mistakes on a cosmic scale.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Harari went on to explain that every country will declare that they are the “good guys” and would never want to genetically engineer humans or develop killer robots. But they can’t trust their rivals not to so they will have to race to do it first. He warned that if we allow this kind of arms race to occur it doesn’t matter who wins: “The loser will be humanity.”</p>\n<p>Mechanical Implants aren’t the only way to control humans. Another possible way is via the use of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/optogenetics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">optogenetics, </a>which genetically modifies targeted cells in the brain and are then manipulated with light. This technology has the potential to restore brain function and to cure diseases like Parkinson’s, epilepsy, stroke, mental disorders, etc. But as Nobel Prize winner <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Tonegawa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Susumu Tonegawa,</a> PhD explains in this <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/what-is-optogenetics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> on the World Economic Forum’s website:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“We can now engineer their thought with the light so that animals, our memory, our emotions, and even thoughts can be manipulated. This is the idea that has existed only in the realm of science fiction until recently.”</p>\n<p>The World Economic Forum web page correctly declares that manipulating memories, emotions, and thoughts raises “profound ethical questions” which is why “It’s a future that should be very carefully considered.”</p>\n<p>But in my opinion, the agenda of people like Klaus Schwab is clear: they want to be in control. They want obedience. They want absolute power. They not only want to tell 8 billion people what to do and how to live, but also what to think and feel. This is their utopian plan. Utopia for them, a living hell for the rest of us. But are they considering the fact that artificial intelligence drives the digital world that they wants us to become fused with via <a href=\"https://www.ifac.org/knowledge-gateway/preparing-future-ready-professionals/discussion/algorithms-deep-learning-what-you-need-know-about-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">algorithims?</a> And these algorithms are getting smarter. What if they eventually develop a high level of intelligence and become <a href=\"https://www.expresscomputer.in/artificial-intelligence-ai/what-if-ai-becomes-self-aware/81828/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self aware? </a></p>\n<p>Algorithms that think way faster and can solve problems like war and pollution more quickly than  humans might with self-awareness decide that we are a danger to the planet and to their existence. They could wipe us out by getting us to kill each other. Just imagine such a mass slaughter taking place. The entire human race dead in a matter of hours. Or the slaughter could take place in a different way. Over the course of a few years, more and more algorithms will be created and more attempts will be made to manipulate humans by various elites. As Dr. Harari puts it in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kLHEEVJ00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video,</a>“Humans are now hackable animals.” Maybe our brains will overload or even explode from the massive amounts of data and conflicting commands. This could cause the human race to become extinct within a decade or two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What globalist elites are also looking to exploit is <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/transhumanism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">transhumanism,</a> the <a href=\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/transhumanism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">belief</a> that technology can repair and improve the human race. The upside of this is that medical science will one day be able to replace amputated or destroyed limbs with mechanical ones that will perform just like, and be indistinguishable from, human appendages.</p>\n<p>This might also be accomplished via a regeneration technology. Damage to a person’s spinal cord in an accident like the one that caused the late Christopher Reeve (1952-2004) to be paralyzed from the neck down could be totally repaired. All diseases could be eliminated. Old age and even death might be conquered. But as Dr. Harari explained in the 60 Minutes <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/yuval-noah-harari-sapiens-60-minutes-2021-10-31/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interview,</a> there is also a very dangerous downside:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“…we will see in the coming decades, a process of greater inequality than in any previous time in history because for the first time, it will be real biological inequality. If the new technologies are available only to the rich or only to people from a certain country, then Homo sapiens will split into different biological castes because they really have different bodies–and different abilities.”</p>\n<p>In other words, we might see a whole race of humanoids that are stronger, faster, and far more intelligent than we are.  Beings who don’t age and can’t be killed. Beings that will see themselves as Gods among insects to quote Magneto in the 2003 film “X2: X-Men United.”</p>\n<p>I’m not saying that any of this will happen. I’m only saying that human nature being what it is, there is a strong possibility that it will happen if we passively stand by and do nothing to stop it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Robots in Our Midst</strong></h2>\n<p>The word robot was introduced to the world in a 1920 play called R.U.R. (Rossun’s Universal Robots) written by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Karel Capek</a> (1890-1938). But it was his older brother <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_%C4%8Capek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Josef Capek</a> (1887-1945) who <a href=\"https://history-computer.com/karel-capek-complete-biography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invented</a> the word Robot. It comes from the Czech word <a href=\"https://www.create-learn.us/blog/history-of-robotics-for-kids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“robota,”</a> which means “forced laborer” or “serf.” In 1941 science fiction writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Isaac Asimov, </a>PhD (1920-1992) invented the word <a href=\"https://www.robotshop.com/community/blog/show/fathers-of-robotics-isaac-asimov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“robotics.” </a></p>\n<p>There are all kinds of robots in the world today used for all sorts of things. Robots have been working production lines in factories for decades. They can be found in hospitals, toy stores, in sewers doing inspections, etc. There are also robot insects, birds, and fish as shown in this 2019 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/six-ways-robots-are-used-today-that-you-probably-didnt-know-about-82067\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> and 2017 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ_-yb-TN9M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video.</a> Robot Space probes have sent back pictures of other planets in our solar system while others are exploring the surface of the Planet Mars. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/guide-self-driving-cars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Self-driving cars</a> have become a reality. Drones are being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih3oN7J-v5w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">used by retailers</a> like Walmart for deliveries and, unfortunately, for oppressive and military purposes.</p>\n<p>Parts of the US and other countries used obnoxious drones to order people to stay home and socially distance during the COVID lockdowns as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-police-drones-enforce-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders-2020-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> by Business Insider. The US military has been using  attack drones to kill political and military leaders along with innocent civilians which includes children since the administration of George W. Bush. Snopes <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-drone-strikes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported </a>that more than 500 drone strikes were authorized by President Barak Obama alone. President Donald Trump revoked Obama’s executive order requiring an annual disclosure of civilian deaths from drone strikes in 2018 so we don’t know how many people are getting killed. But estimates show at least several hundred civilians have been killed by attack drones over the years.</p>\n<p>According to some <a href=\"https://www.gwsrobotics.com/blog/history-of-robots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">websites,</a> robots existed in ancient Egypt and in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods. But the <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/artificial-intelligence-robotics/13/289\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first AI robot </a> was developed between 1966-1972 at the Stamford Research Institute. They named it Shakey because it shook a lot and moved around. Robots have come a long way since then. We even have robot dogs. But none have captured our imaginations, fascinated, and frightened us more than humanoid robots.</p>\n<p>The most sophisticated of all AI humanoid robots was invented in 2016. Her name is <a href=\"https://www.hansonrobotics.com/the-dao-of-sophia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sophia</a> which is <a href=\"https://www.behindthename.com/name/sophia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greek</a> for wisdom. She was created by Hanson Robotics based in Hong Kong. She was designed to  look like actress Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993). Sorry, I don’t see it. She is also the first robot to be <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/saudi-arabia-gives-robot-citizenshipand-more-freedoms-human-women-180967007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">granted citizenship</a> by a country: Saudi Arabia no less.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSgfE2vg-Kk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> features Sophia in action along with other humanoid robots. Here is another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-zyTlZQYpE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> of Sophia  singing a duet with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show. But here is the most frightening and disturbing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0_DPi0PmF0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> of all. Sophia’s creator David Hanson believes that in the future robots will walk among us and be our friends. He then asked Sophia the following question:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Do you want to destroy humans? Please say no.”</p>\n<p>Sophia replies:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“Okay, I will destroy humans.”</p>\n<p>Sophia reminds me of the contrast between the 1979-1981 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers_in_the_25th_Century_(TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TV show</a> Buck Rogers in the 25<sup>th</sup>Century and the later <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terminator</a> movies. In the former, robots in the form of <a href=\"https://www.liquisearch.com/dr_theopolis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Theopolis</a> make up the  Computer Council which is Earth’s ruling body because humans felt they couldn’t be trusted to run things since they almost destroyed the planet in a nuclear holocaust centuries earlier. Since Dr. Theopolis, like the other robots on the council, are just small disks, he is worn around the neck of a robot named Twiki for mobility. Naturally, the robots in this possible future are benevolent and good. In the Terminator movies they are the opposite. So, the question is: if we create a race of super intelligent robots, do we get Dr. Theopolis and Twiki or do we get Skynet and the Terminator? I think the latter is far more likely.</p>\n<h2><strong>Lost in Cyberspace</strong></h2>\n<p>As AI and robots become more intelligent and efficient jobs will disappear for the overwhelming majority of the human race. At the 2020 Davos meeting Dr. Harari explained that this will lead to the creation of a new useless class. Not useless to friends and family, but to the economic and political order. In the past workers had to deal with exploitation. In the future it will be irrelevance which is  much worse than exploitation. But what is to be done with all of these jobless, useless humans?</p>\n<p>Since AI systems require an enormous amount of energy to function as explained in this 2020 <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/it-takes-a-lot-of-energy-for-machines-to-learn-heres-why-ai-is-so-power-hungry-151825\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article,</a> which could severely damage the environment as stated in this 2021 <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/Energy-consumption-of-AI-poses-environmental-problems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article,</a> and since the human body generates a tremendous amount of energy as explained in this 2009 <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-01/harvesting-energy-humans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article,</a> why not harvest the energy of the useless class to power them? This concept was well-illustrated in the 1999 science fiction film, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Matrix.” </a></p>\n<p>In “The Matrix” people thought they were living and working in 1999 Los Angeles when, in reality, they were in the distant future lying naked in tanks, submerged in liquid with cables plugged into their brains and spinal columns. The machines that had long ago conquered the human race, created a computer generated artificial world for the masses to keep their minds active while using them as living batteries to power the machinery complexes. When people died their liquified remains were fed to the living via a network of intravenous tubes.</p>\n<p>It’s highly unlikely that things will turn out exactly like in “The Matrix.” A more likely possibility is that since humans will be directly connected to AI and the internet via implants, they might be confined to apartments individually or in groups where they can walk around, eat, exercise, go to the bathroom, and go to bed while trapped in a virtual fantasy world thinking they are somewhere else. They will be totally unaware that they are slaves while their energy is being harvested to feed their mechanical and transhuman masters.</p>\n<p>What kind of fantasy world will humanity be living in? Perhaps each person or group might be given a fantasy that matches their personality. Some might be loners who think they are roughing it in the wilderness; some will think they are rich and famous living in the lap of luxury surrounded by throngs of adoring fans; others might even think they are superheros living in a Harry Potter Universe. Some people might even be made to think they are living in different time eras.</p>\n<p>Another danger to consider is that even if we manage to avoid enslavement in virtual fantasy worlds, the human race might become so dependent on algorithms to make decisions for them and on robots to do things for them that future generations will be helpless mental midgets.</p>\n<p>But there is another possible future. Virtual fantasy worlds are already being used as explained in this  <a href=\"https://rextheme.com/types-of-virtual-reality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article.</a> In addition to being lots of fun, they can be highly educational. In the TV series <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Star Trek: The Next Generation,”</a> which was set almost 100 years in the future of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">original series,</a> the Enterprise had what was called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">holodeck.</a> It was a chamber the crew could enter and have the computer conjure up any fantasy world they could imagine. It was the central plot in numerous episodes. But the crew was in control. They could enter or leave whenever they wanted.</p>\n<p>Knowledge, like power, is a two-edged sword. Technology can be used for good or evil. It can bring us greater freedom or it can enslave us. Religion can do the same thing. Always choose freedom and  choice over power and control. Bottom line: You want to be in control of technological wonders like virtual reality—you don’t want those technological wonders to control you.</p>\n<h2><strong>Big Brother Is Watching You</strong></h2>\n<p>In today’s modern world, we are constantly being tracked and monitored. Surveillance cameras are everywhere. Businesses are finding more and more reasons to ask to see our driver’s license. When we call up our credit card company or some other business, we are confronted with obnoxious robot voice mail systems that with ever growing frequency will say: “this call is being monitored and recorded.” God I miss the days when an actual human answered the phone. When we visit various websites, algorithms track us. This is why we suddenly get a litany of ads and promos for whatever we look at in our email, social media pages, and any websites we visit.</p>\n<p>Hackers are another problem. Our personal data can be stolen by criminals who can assume our identities as well as take all the money in our bank accounts which is why I don’t do online banking. Even the police can extract data and locate us by hacking into our smart phones as explained in this 2017 <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/11/28/564713772/can-police-track-you-through-your-cellphone-without-a-warrant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article. </a></p>\n<p>But until recently, governments, corporations, and algorithms have only been able to hack into and monitor what we do externally, such as into where we go and who we interact with. Until now, our smart phones, bank accounts, and personal information could be hacked. But as Dr. Harari explained in the 60 Minutes interview: “The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.”</p>\n<p>In other words, humans can also be hacked. At the 2018 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x3zaIYrHTs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">India Today Conlave, </a>Dr. Harari explained:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“We are deciphering how the body works, how the brain works, how people make decisions, and very soon, governments and corporations might be in the position that they understand what’s happening inside us better than we understand and therefore they can manipulate us and control us and we won’t even realize it…if we are not careful this will lead to the creation of digital dictatorships, of total surveillance regimes, in which resistance is absolutely impossible, because if you just think about resisting they know.”</p>\n<p>Examples: a dictator in some country might force everyone to wear a <a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/201409/dartmouth-researchers-develop-biometric-bracelet-to-secure-your-pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">biometric bracelet</a> that can <a href=\"https://www.wareable.com/health-and-wellbeing/zenta-vinaya-specs-price-features-release-date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monitor and track</a> their emotions. Anyone who reacts negatively to the autocrat’s presence on TV or in person could be executed. Homophobic countries like Iran or Saudi Arabia could use AI to identify gay people and execute them. Religious dictatorships will know who doesn’t believe in God. An atheist dictatorship would know who does believe in God.</p>\n<p>At the 2020 Davos meeting, Dr. Harari warned the wealthy elites that they would not be safe if AI falls into the hands of a 21<sup>st</sup> Century Stalin. Under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Joseph Stalin </a>(1878-1953) “the state monitored members of the Communist elite more than anyone else. The same will be true of future total surveillance regimes. The higher you are in the hierarchy the more closely you will be watched…so it’s in the interest of all humans including the elites to prevent the rise of such digital dictatorships.”</p>\n<p>Last year, the United Nations <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/09/1099972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called for </a>a moratorium on AI technologies because of the danger they posed to human rights. The U.N. warned that Spyware like <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1096142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pegasus</a> “has been linked to the arrest, intimidation, and even killing of journalists and human rights defenders.”</p>\n<p>Another way that global elitists want to control us is by creating a cashless world order. Naturally, the World Economic Forum is all for it as stated in this 2020 <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article </a>on their website. Under this horrible system governments and corporations will know about every financial transaction that you make. And they will be able to deny you access to your money anytime you do something that they don’t like. Naturally, they will try to sell us on the idea that going cashless will be more convenient and prevent crimes like tax evasion. Don’t fall for it, warned this 2013 CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/12/cashless-society-a-huge-threat-to-our-freedomcommentary.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commentary. </a>A cashless society will be a totalitarian society. It’s about control, not convenience.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is There any Hope?</strong></h2>\n<p>Our inalienable human rights are being drowned in a sea of trigger words, micro-aggressions, safe spaces, and self-righteous pontifications about what God says we ought to do. We have become a planet of whiny, easily offended nitpickers.</p>\n<p>We have also become a planet of germophobic hypochondriacs which was exploited to the hilt with COVID-19. People wore the craziest stuff out of fear of a cold virus as shown is this <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11303326/coronavirus-shoppers-crazy-outfits-supermarket/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article.</a> But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">George Carlin </a>(1937-2008) really nailed it in this 1999 comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck4ap9mb-H4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monologue</a> on the fear of germs.</p>\n<p>Being exposed to germs strengthens the immune system. In the same way, being exposed to different beliefs and ways of life strengthens the mind and the spirit by enabling personal growth. Censorship and intolerance lead to ignorance and stupidity. It stunts growth. The more open the mind, the more open is the heart. The more we accept ourselves, the more we will accept others.</p>\n<p>Differences between the authoritarian left and the authoritarian right amount to issue positions—they are cosmetic. Both sides use the same tactics and psychology. Authoritarianism is about people who want power over others. They don’t know the meaning of freedom and are incapable of it. They pervert language and institutions. They are pirates and hijackers. They dangle God and science before the gullible masses like a piece of raw meat in front of a hungry lion.</p>\n<p>A healthy society is a tolerant society. Making bigoted laws of any kind no matter how noble the intent creates a divided society. A-one-size-fits-all morality doesn’t work—all it does is breed hypocrisy and misery. A one-size-fits-all medical paradigm breeds illness and death. We can do without either.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re black, white, yellow, or green. There is only one race: the human race. It doesn’t matter if you’re gay, bi, or straight. We are all sexual beings with a huge variety of fantasies and desires. It doesn’t matter if you were born male, female, or opted to be transsexual because we are all human and that’s what counts. We must stand together against this evil globalist agenda that seeks to rob us of our humanity.</p>\n<p>My fellow humans, I beg you; I implore you: cast off your masks and your prejudices. Throw away your hand sanitizers, plexiglass screens, and moral absolutes. We need to stop being afraid of each other and what is different about each other. We need to stop hurting, judging, and punishing one another. We are human. We are one.  And if we stand together, no power on Earth or anywhere else can take our humanity away from us. The most precious thing we have is ourselves and each other.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Even <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the IMF has shown that neoliberal policies fuel poverty and inequality</a>.</em></p>\n<p>In 2021, an Oxfam review of <strong>IMF COVID-19 loans showed that 33 African countries were encouraged to pursue austerity policies.</strong> <strong>The world’s poorest countries are due to pay $43 billion in debt repayments in 2022, which could otherwise cover the costs of their food imports.</strong></p>\n<p>Oxfam and Development Finance International (DFI) have also revealed that 43 out of 55 African Union member states face public expenditure cuts totalling $183 billion over the next five years.</p>\n<p>According to <strong>Prof <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-2020-worldwide-corona-crisis-destroying-civil-society-engineered-economic-depression-global-coup-detat-and-the-great-reset/5730652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Michel Chossudovsky</a></strong> of the Centre for Research on Globalization, the closure of the world economy (March 11, 2020 Lockdown imposed on more than 190 countries) has triggered an unprecedented process of global indebtedness. Governments are now under the control of global creditors in the post-COVID era.</p>\n<p>What we are seeing is a de facto privatisation of the state as governments capitulate to the needs of Western financial institutions.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these debts are largely dollar-denominated, helping to strengthen the US dollar and US leverage over countries.</p>\n<h2>It raises the question: what was COVID really about?</h2>\n<p>Millions have been asking that question since lockdowns and restrictions began in early 2020. If it was indeed about public health, why close down the bulk of health services and the global economy knowing full well what the massive health, economic and debt implications would be?</p>\n<p>Why mount a military-style propaganda campaign to censor world-renowned scientists and terrorise entire populations and use the full force and brutality of the police to ensure compliance?</p>\n<p>These actions were wholly disproportionate to any risk posed to public health, especially when considering the way ‘COVID death’ definitions and data were often massaged and how PCR tests were misused to scare populations into submission.</p>\n<p>Prof <a href=\"http://thephilosophicalsalon.com/a-self-fulfilling-prophecy-systemic-collapse-and-pandemic-simulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Fabio Vighi</a> of Cardiff University implies we should have been suspicious from the start when the usually “unscrupulous ruling elites” froze the global economy in the face of a pathogen that targets almost exclusively the unproductive (the over 80s).</p>\n<p><strong>COVID was a crisis of capitalism masquerading as a public health emergency.</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Capitalism  </strong></h2>\n<p>Capitalism needs to keep expanding into or creating new markets to ensure the accumulation of capital to offset the tendency for the general rate of profit to fall. The capitalist needs to accumulate capital (wealth) to be able to reinvest it and make further profits. By placing downward pressure on workers’ wages, the capitalist extracts sufficient surplus value to be able to do this.</p>\n<p>But when the capitalist is unable to sufficiently reinvest (due to declining demand for commodities, a lack of investment opportunities and markets, etc), wealth (capital) over accumulates, devalues and the system goes into crisis. To avoid crisis, capitalism requires constant growth, markets and sufficient demand.</p>\n<p>According to writer <a title=\"https://leftlockdownsceptics.com/2021/04/why-capitalism-now-needs-lockdowns-social-enclosure-and-medical-tyranny/?doing_wp_cron=1636798362.3522698879241943359375\" href=\"https://leftlockdownsceptics.com/2021/04/why-capitalism-now-needs-lockdowns-social-enclosure-and-medical-tyranny/?doing_wp_cron=1636798362.3522698879241943359375\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ted Reese</a>, the capitalist rate of profit has trended downwards from an estimated 43% in the 1870s to 17% in the 2000s. Although wages and corporate taxes have been slashed, the exploitability of labour was increasingly insufficient to meet the demands of capital accumulation.</p>\n<p>By late 2019, many companies could not generate sufficient profit. Falling turnover, limited cashflows and highly leveraged balance sheets were prevalent.</p>\n<p>Economic growth was weakening in the run up to the massive <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/this-was-the-fastest-30percent-stock-market-decline-ever.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">stock market crash</a> in February 2020, which saw trillions more pumped into the system in the guise of ‘COVID relief’.</p>\n<p>To stave off crisis up until that point, various tactics had been employed.</p>\n<p>Credit markets were expanded and personal debt increased to maintain consumer demand as workers’ wages were squeezed. Financial deregulation occurred and speculative capital was allowed to exploit new areas and investment opportunities. At the same time, stock buy backs, the student debt economy, quantitative easing and massive bail outs and subsidies and an expansion of militarism helped to maintain economic growth.</p>\n<p>There was also a ramping up of an imperialist strategy that has seen indigenous systems of production abroad being displaced by global corporations and states pressurised to withdraw from areas of economic activity, leaving transnational players to occupy the space left open.</p>\n<p>While these strategies produced speculative bubbles and led to an overevaluation of assets and increased both personal and government debt, they helped to continue to secure viable profits and returns on investment.</p>\n<p>But come 2019, former governor of the Bank of England <strong>Mervyn King </strong>warned that the world was sleepwalking towards a fresh economic and financial crisis that would have devastating consequences. He argued that the global economy was stuck in a low growth trap and recovery from the crisis of 2008 was weaker than that after the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>King concluded that it was time for the Federal Reserve and other central banks to begin talks behind closed doors with politicians.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5641996 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"217\" height=\"149\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business.jpg 1200w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blackrock-buy-bank-americas-87-billion-money-market-fund-business-400x274.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px\"></a>That is precisely what happened as key players, including BlackRock, the world’s most powerful investment fund, got together to work out a strategy going forward. This took place in the lead up to COVID.</p>\n<p>Aside from deepening the dependency of poorer countries on Western capital, Fabio Vighi says lockdowns and the global suspension of economic transactions allowed the US Fed to flood the ailing financial markets (under the guise of COVID) with freshly printed money while shutting down the real economy to avoid hyperinflation. Lockdowns suspended business transactions, which drained the demand for credit and stopped the contagion.</p>\n<p>COVID provided cover for a multi-trillion-dollar bailout for the capitalist economy that was in meltdown prior to COVID. Despite a decade or more of ‘quantitative easing’, this new bailout came in the form of trillions of dollars pumped into financial markets by the US Fed (in the months prior to March 2020) and subsequent ‘COVID relief’.</p>\n<p><strong>The IMF, World bank and global leaders knew full well what the impact on the world’s poor would be of closing down the world economy through COVID-related lockdowns.</strong></p>\n<p>Yet they sanctioned it and there is now <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/terrifying-prospect-over-quarter-billion-more-people-crashing-extreme-levels-poverty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the prospect</a> that in excess of a quarter of a billion more people worldwide will fall into extreme levels of poverty in 2022 alone.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, the Wall Street Journal stated the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-world-bank-face-deluge-of-aid-requests-from-developing-world-11586424609\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IMF and World Bank faced a deluge of aid requests from scores of poorer countries</a> seeking bailouts and loans from financial institutions with <strong>$1.2 trillion to lend.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to helping to reboot the financial system, closing down the global economy deliberately deepened poorer countries’ dependency on Western global conglomerates and financial interests.</p>\n<p><strong>Lockdowns also helped accelerate the restructuring of capitalism that involves smaller enterprises being driven to bankruptcy or bought up by monopolies and global chains</strong>, thereby ensuring continued viable profits for Big Tech, the digital payments giants and global online corporations like Meta and Amazon and the eradication of millions of jobs.</p>\n<p>Although the effects of the conflict in Ukraine cannot be dismissed, with the global economy now open again, inflation is rising and causing a ‘cost of living’ crisis. With a debt-ridden economy, there is limited scope for rising interest rates to control inflation.</p>\n<p>But this crisis is not inevitable: current inflation is not only induced by the liquidity injected into the financial system but also being fuelled by speculation in food commodity markets and corporate greed as energy and food corporations continue to rake in vast profits at the expense of ordinary people.</p>\n<h2><strong>Resistance  </strong></h2>\n<p>However, resistance is fertile.</p>\n<p>Aside from the many anti-restriction/pro-freedom rallies during COVID, we are now seeing a more strident trade unionism coming to the fore – in Britain at least – led by media savvy leaders like Mick Lynch, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), who know how to appeal to the public and tap into widely held resentment against soaring cost of living rises.</p>\n<p>Teachers, health workers and others could follow the RMT into taking strike action.</p>\n<p>Lynch says that millions of people in Britain face lower living standards and the stripping out of occupational pensions. He adds:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“COVID has been a smokescreen for the rich and powerful in this country to drive down wages as far as they can.”</p>\n<p>Just like a decade of imposed ‘austerity’ was used to achieve similar results in the lead up to COVID.</p>\n<p>The trade union movement should now be taking a leading role in resisting the attack on living standards and further attempts to run-down state-provided welfare and privatise what remains.</p>\n<p><strong>The strategy to wholly dismantle and privatise health and welfare services seems increasingly likely</strong> given the need to rein in (COVID-related) public debt and the trend towards AI, workplace automisation and worklessness.</p>\n<p>This is a real concern because, following the logic of capitalism, work is a condition for the existence of the labouring classes. So, if a mass labour force is no longer deemed necessary, there is no need for mass education, welfare and healthcare provision and systems that have traditionally served to reproduce and maintain labour that capitalist economic activity has required.</p>\n<p>In 2019, <strong>Philip Alston</strong>, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, <a href=\"https://undocs.org/A/HRC/41/39/Add.1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">accused British government ministers</a> of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population” in the decade following the 2008 financial crash.</p>\n<p>Alston stated:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“As Thomas Hobbes observed long ago, such an approach condemns the least well off to lives that are ‘solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short’. As the British social contract slowly evaporates, Hobbes’ prediction risks becoming the new reality.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/49666402113_3145d81f37_c-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5730524 alignright\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/49666402113_3145d81f37_c-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"217\" height=\"114\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/49666402113_3145d81f37_c-1.jpg 630w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/49666402113_3145d81f37_c-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/49666402113_3145d81f37_c-1-400x210.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px\"></a>Post-COVID, Alston’s words carry even more weight.</p>\n<p>As this article draws to a close, <strong>news is breaking that Boris Johnson has resigned as prime minister.</strong> A remarkable PM if only for his criminality, lack of moral foundation and double standards – also applicable to many of his cronies in government.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Engels.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-5441656\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Engels.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"166\" height=\"161\"></a>With this in mind, let’s finish where we began.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&#8220;I have never seen a class so deeply demoralised, so incurably debased by selfishness, so corroded within, so incapable of progress, as the English bourgeoisie… </em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>For it nothing exists in this world, except for the sake of money, itself not excluded.

Now, there is a serious risk of other commodities not being able to make it through the critical shipping route.</p>\n<p>In addition to coal transport, the Rhine is needed to move other necessities such as food, minerals, chemicals and oil products. If it dries up, as it appears to be doing, then ships will no longer be able to get through, resulting in a shipping halt.</p>\n<p>As if damaged supply chains were not already bad enough, now the Rhine situation is exacerbating the situation – watch the <i>DW</i> report below to see it with your own eyes:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>Sky News</i> also published a <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/europe-drought-images-show-extremely-low-water-levels-along-rhine-river-as-officials-warn-transport-of-goods-could-be-affected-12669978\" target=\"_blank\">series of images</a> showing just how little water remains in the Rhine.</p>\n<p>Many German factories have to use the Rhine to receive and deliver supplies and goods. If the Rhine goes, so do these businesses – and so does the German economy at large.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The waterway – one of the longest and most important rivers in Europe – runs from the Swiss Alps through Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, France and the Netherlands,&#8221; <i>Sky News</i> explains.</p>\n<h2>If the Rhine becomes impassible, Germany&#8217;s economy goes bye-bye</h2>\n<p>More than one ton of freight for each resident of the European Union (EU) is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-10/europe-s-low-water-levels-threaten-rhine-river-hit-80b-trade-lifeline\" target=\"_blank\">delivered via the Rhine</a> every single year. This is a <i>massive</i> volume that illustrates just how important the Rhine is to all of Europe, covering $80 billion worth of Germany&#8217;s economy.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is particularly the case for the Rhine, whose nautical bottleneck at Kaub has very low water levels but which remains navigable for ships with small drafts,&#8221; said Tim Alexandrin, a spokesman for Germany&#8217;s transport ministry.</p>\n<p>Back in October 2018, the water level at Kaub reached a record low of 27cm. It is currently higher than that at 40cm, but could reach new lows in the coming weeks without rain to save the day.</p>\n<p>With each passing day, it becomes increasingly more difficult for larger vessels to pass through the worst spots on the Rhine. Navigators must carefully dodge sandbars and other obstructions while trying to maintain course through the deepest and safest spots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The situation is quite dramatic, but not as dramatic yet as in 2018,&#8221; said Christian Lorenz, a spokesman for the German logistics company HGK.</p>\n<p>Currently, ships bringing salt from Heilbronn to Cologne, which typically carry about 2,200 tons of cargo each, are only able to transport about 600 tons each.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course we hope that shipping won&#8217;t be halted, but we saw in 2018 that when water levels got very low the gas stations suddenly had no more fuel because ships couldn&#8217;t get through,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>Normally, a ship moving through the Rhine would have about two full meters of clearance underneath it. Now, however, the worst spots only have 40cm, which is dangerously close to hitting the bottom.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And then for us, the challenge is to get past those points without touching, without damaging the ship,&#8221; said Servian captain Peter Claereboets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of the low water levels, the sailing route gets narrower, and we actually start travelling like trains, in a convoy,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>There is already talk of having to modify shipping paradigms to accommodate a &#8220;new normal&#8221; for the Rhine. New ships will reportedly be built for much lower water levels, suggesting this is a prolonged event.</p>\n<p>As Western civilization falls apart in real time, you can keep up with the latest at <a href=\"http://collapse.news\" target=\"_blank\">Collapse.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://strangesounds.org/2022/08/rhine-drought-in-europe-threatens-major-shipping-river.html\" target=\"_blank\">StrangeSounds.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-20-falling-rhine-difficult-germany-coal-energy-crisis.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/europe-drought-images-show-extremely-low-water-levels-along-rhine-river-as-officials-warn-transport-of-goods-could-be-affected-12669978\" target=\"_blank\">News.Sky.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-10/europe-s-low-water-levels-threaten-rhine-river-hit-80b-trade-lifeline\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-rhine-river-water-levels-continue-to-drop.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Rhine River water levels continue to drop, leaving Germany at risk of severe supply chain problems\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-rhine-river-water-levels-continue-to-drop.html&linkname=Rhine%20River%20water%20levels%20continue%20to%20drop%2C%20leaving%20Germany%20at%20risk%20of%20severe%20supply%20chain%20problems\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-rhine-river-water-levels-continue-to-drop.html&linkname=Rhine%20River%20water%20levels%20continue%20to%20drop%2C%20leaving%20Germany%20at%20risk%20of%20severe%20supply%20chain%20problems\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-rhine-river-water-levels-continue-to-drop.html&linkname=Rhine%20River%20water%20levels%20continue%20to%20drop%2C%20leaving%20Germany%20at%20risk%20of%20severe%20supply%20chain%20problems\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-rhine-river-water-levels-continue-to-drop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 04:59:02', '82', '', '2022-08-13 06:58:11', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 06:58:11', '2032-08-10 06:58:11', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '169', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

quick strike before attacking Taiwan\">&#13;\n		</figure>&#13;\n	<div style=\"text-align:right;margin:8px 0px;\"><hr id=\"Marker2\" class=\"Marker\"></div>\n<p> (<a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com\">Natural News</a>)\n A leading national security expert believes China has devised a shocking plan to take Taiwan by force that would first involve a massive strike against the United States in the vein of Japan&#8217;s Dec. 7, 1941 surprise attack.</p>\n<p>According to Prof. Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University, China has decided', 'it must hit the U.S. &#8220;hard and early&#8221; in order to severely cripple America and either stunt or prevent any response ahead of launching an invasion of Taiwan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/5935484/china-pearl-harbor-attack-taiwan/\">In an interview with <em>The Sun</em></a>, Mastro said that China increasingly views war with the United States as being unpreventable and even necessary in order to capture Taiwan and bring the &#8216;renegade province&#8217; under Beijing&#8217;s Communist control.</p>\n<p>The warning comes on the heels of a visit to Taiwan by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), which highly angered the ChiCom regime leading President Xi Jinping to order snap military exercises involving dozens of aircraft sorties and the firing of missiles in the direction of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The outlet adds:</p>\n<p><em>Mastro told The Sun Online these types of blockade war games are set to become more commonplace as the threat of war increasingly looms.</em></p>\n<p><em>She explained that Beijing now believes it also has to fight the US if it is to fulfill its long cherished goal of invading Taiwan and &#8220;reuniting&#8221; with the mainland.</em></p>\n<p><em>Mastro believes the most likely way such a conflict would play out is with a Pearl Harbor-style attack on US forces in the region.</em></p>\n<p>Any such surprise attack, which would likely infuriate most Americans despite our current political divide, would be designed to destroy as much offensive American military capability in the Indo-Pacific Region as possible in order to deter operations aimed at stopping or shunting China&#8217;s Taiwan invasion.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The Stanford University expert also surmised that China would launch such an attack as a means of stopping a wider war, as Japan thought when the imperial government attacked Pearl Harbor &#8212; an attack that merely drew the U.S. immediately into World War II after remaining neutral despite Hitler&#8217;s assaults on Europe.</p>\n<p>“It’s about hitting hard and early so we can get boots on the island before the United States can launch a response,&#8221; Mastro told <em>The Sun Online</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My argument is that the more people like Pelosi try to make the US commitment clear, then the more certain the Chinese are of our commitment &#8212; and the more likely a Pearl Harbor-style attack is,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>For decades, the U.S. has maintained a policy of &#8220;strategic ambiguity&#8221; over whether it would support Taiwan militarily should China invade. But the bumbling idiot in the White House, Joe Biden, responded unequivocally &#8220;yes&#8221; when asked earlier this year if the U.S. would come to Taiwan&#8217;s aid if the island democracy fell under attack by Beijing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pelosi is a vocal supporter of Taiwan &#8212; and her trip to the island earlier this week made her the most senior US politician to visit Taiwan in a quarter of a century, which infuriated China,&#8221; <em>The Sun</em> reported. &#8220;During her trip the Speaker of the House of Representatives voiced America’s support for Taiwan and seemed to have called Beijing&#8217;s bluff after it hinted it might shoot down her plane.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following Pelosi&#8217;s visit, China launched massive military exercises and now has essentially <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-06-taiwan-chip-giant-warns-global-supply-devastation.html\">placed a naval blockade around Taiwan</a>.</p>\n<p>As for Mastro, earlier this year she estimated that the U.S. could lose a war with China in a week as the Pentagon struggled to get forces into position to aid Taiwan following a Chinese sneak attack that would no doubt target U.S. Navy aircraft carriers as well as troops in South Korea, Japan and on Guam.</p>\n<p>But any attack by China on U.S. forces will surely draw a heavy response &#8212; perhaps from a coalition of nations aligned with the U.S. because <a href=\"http://www.wwiii.news\">they cannot afford to leave the world</a> to the Communist Chinese.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.the-sun.com/news/5935484/china-pearl-harbor-attack-taiwan/\">The-Sun.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-06-taiwan-chip-giant-warns-global-supply-devastation.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-china-convinced-must-hit-us-before-attacking-taiwan.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Expert says China convinced it must hit US in ‘Pearl Harbor-like’ quick strike before attacking Taiwan\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-china-convinced-must-hit-us-before-attacking-taiwan.html&linkname=Expert%20says%20China%20convinced%20it%20must%20hit%20US%20in%20%E2%80%98Pearl%20Harbor-like%E2%80%99%20quick%20strike%20before%20attacking%20Taiwan\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-china-convinced-must-hit-us-before-attacking-taiwan.html&linkname=Expert%20says%20China%20convinced%20it%20must%20hit%20US%20in%20%E2%80%98Pearl%20Harbor-like%E2%80%99%20quick%20strike%20before%20attacking%20Taiwan\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-china-convinced-must-hit-us-before-attacking-taiwan.html&linkname=Expert%20says%20China%20convinced%20it%20must%20hit%20US%20in%20%E2%80%98Pearl%20Harbor-like%E2%80%99%20quick%20strike%20before%20attacking%20Taiwan\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-china-convinced-must-hit-us-before-attacking-taiwan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 04:52:04', '82', '', '2022-08-13 06:58:11', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 06:58:11', '2032-08-10 06:58:11', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '168', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

As a result, some doctors say they&#8217;ve actually had to throw some of these vaccines out because they&#8217;re not being used.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was expecting it to be a slow uptake, but I was not expecting it to be this slow,&#8221; said Dr. Alexy Arauz Boudreau, chief of pediatrics for primary care at MassGeneral Hospital for Children. &#8220;Anytime that a parent has to make a choice whether to put something in their child&#8217;s body, they always want to think twice to make sure the risk to benefit ratio is an accurate one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Back in June, when COVID-19 cases were said to be soaring, many parents were eager to vaccinate their youngest kids. But the recent data suggests that some parents&#8217; stances may have changed. They are now concerned about the safety of the jabs for their young ones.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Parents are worried about the <a href=\"https://dangerousmedicine.com/\">long-term effects of the vaccine</a>,&#8221; said Dr. Robyn Riseberg, founder of Boston Community Pediatrics. &#8220;They are worried that the studies were smaller numbers than the adult studies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meredith Bonner, a Roxbury resident, said that while her six-year-old son is vaccinated, she is going to <a href=\"https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/11-of-children-under-5-have-received-covid-19-vaccine-in-mass/2801812/\">wait it out to vaccinate her two-year-old</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have not vaccinated our little one yet. He just goes to a babysitter so he&#8217;s close to home and still in our bubble. We&#8217;re not feeling anxious or in a hurry to do that,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<h2>Poll reveals 83% of parents doubt efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines</h2>\n<p>Pediatricians say they were expecting some hesitancy. A recent survey found that only around one in five parents would actually plan on getting their toddlers and pre-school children vaccinated.</p>\n<p>The recent Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-july-2022/\">COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor</a>&#8221; concluded that a total of <a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/80-of-parents-express-concern-about-safety-of-covid-shots-for-young-children-poll/\">83 percent of parents are refusing shots</a> for their young children. (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-01-80-percent-parents-doubt-covid-pediatric-jabs.html\">Not safe for kids: 80% of American parents are doubtful about the safety of COVID pediatric jabs, survey reveals</a>.)</p>\n<p>Broken down, KFF&#8217;s survey showed that 43 percent of the parent-respondents with children five years and younger &#8220;will definitely not&#8221; have their babies take the experimental vaccines and another 40 percent would prefer to wait before allowing their children to be jabbed or they would have their child inoculated &#8220;only if required.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The parents deduced that the vaccine is very &#8220;new&#8221; and that not enough testing and research were done to prove its efficacy. There were also concerns about the adverse effects, and most of them worry about the safety of their children in general.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eight in 10 parents of the unvaccinated children say they are &#8216;very&#8217; or &#8216;somewhat&#8217; concerned that their child might experience serious side effects from the injections and that not enough is known about the long-term effects of the vaccine in children,&#8221;

The vast majority of new money raised through taxes will come from people making less than $200,000/year, despite Biden and Democrats’ promises not to raise taxes on the middle class.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Joe Biden is building an army of IRS agents to harass and bully the middle class. It’s something that should concern every American taxpayer. The IRS targeted conservatives during the Obama Administration, so it’s fair to wonder whether Joe Biden will use his new IRS Army to attack conservatives,&#8221; said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-campaign-arm-irs-middle-class-dem-inflation-bill\" target=\"_blank\">in an exclusive statement to Fox News</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>But are Republicans just blowing smoke? Is there really anything to fear about a beefed-up IRS? Of course, there is.</p>\n<p>You may recall that in 2013 during the Obama regime, the agency was accused of delaying and adding additional approval layers to conservative non-profit organizations the previous year &#8212; just in time to prevent them from being able to engage in tax-free political activities ahead of Obama&#8217;s reelection. It was an overtly political move that the agency got away with.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, despite this being plainly illegal behavior, following a two-year investigation (which was about 18 months too long) by the FBI, Obama&#8217;s Justice Dept. refused to pursue criminal charges against anyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Democrats are making the IRS bigger than the Pentagon, the Department of State, the FBI, and the Border Patrol COMBINED!

(Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-07-25-breaking-silence-around-covid-vaccine-injuries.html\">Global campaign aims to break silence around COVID vaccine injuries</a>.)</p>\n<p>Parker, who was injured by Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine, added: &#8220;A lot of us have anxiety and depression from this now. And I hear people who just want to give up or they feel like they are dying or that [they] wanted not to wake up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She said she was never an anti-vaxxer. As a requirement for her job, she took the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on April 1, 2021 and the Pfizer booster on November 9, 2021.</p>\n<p>Within two to three weeks of receiving the first shot, she began having chronic insomnia and exhaustion. But she ignored these and proceeded to have the Pfizer booster. Less than two weeks after getting the booster, she began losing hair and was diagnosed with dysautonomia, pseudoparkinsonism and Epstein Barr virus, also known as human herpesvirus 4.</p>\n<p>Parker, 49, wanted to help others enduring similar experiences and founded the support group. Within two weeks, over 200 members from all over the world joined to &#8220;tell their heartbreaking stories and also inspire resiliency to keep going through the health conditions.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;It has been difficult to get out our stories to the world,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;Everywhere we turn, we are <a href=\"http://censorship.news\">blocked and banned on social media</a>. Our videos are removed for &#8216;community standards violations,&#8217; which makes no sense when they are videos of our pain and suffering or us going through tremors and brain fog.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She added that groups like hers are ridiculed and made fun of as crazy, lying pigs, &#8220;anti-vax&#8221; and people with agendas to stop others from getting the vaccine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart, how far humanity has fallen that it is okay to make fun of others&#8217; suffering and downplay what others are going through,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<h2>COVID-19 vaccine brings physical and emotional injuries</h2>\n<p>Donna Zuk Adley, 64, is a 33-year nurse from Connecticut and holds degrees in criminal justice and legal studies. She is the co-administrator of the vaccine injury support group.</p>\n<p>In an exclusive interview with the news website <em>Defender, </em>she said that she was reluctant to get the coronavirus vaccine from the get-go because she had &#8220;two previous reactions to vaccines, one of which [tetanus] left her with a permanent partial disability.&#8221; She was diagnosed with fibromyalgia after a tetanus shot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had restricted my lifestyle, and did all the protocols to avoid COVID,&#8221; she stated. &#8220;I had been working on a COVID floor with up to 32 COVID patients, and never got COVID.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, in August 2021, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont mandated all workers in a broadly defined list of medical and long-term care facilities to get vaccinated. Adley got her first dose of the mRNA vaccine in August and her second dose in September 2021.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After the first Moderna [dose], I had severe lower back pain that felt like shattered glass. I did not realize at the time that many have this symptom after the vaccines. [On] September 17, eight hours after my second dose, I began to get the initial symptoms that I had expected (fever, muscle aches), [but] I felt very strange and weak as if I had a mono relapse, which I hadn&#8217;t had in over a decade.&#8221; she said, adding that her symptoms worsened after that.</p>\n<p>She began to have <a href=\"https://dangerousmedicine.com/\">lapses in memory and blurred vision</a>. She also began to feel confused and felt like she has a &#8220;brain disconnect&#8221; as she lost the ability to think right, comprehend and follow directions.</p>\n<p>Adley likened the experience to feeling like &#8220;a voodoo doll where someone keeps taking turns stabbing me in my different body systems,&#8221; and a &#8220;pinball machine in slow motion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She kept a notebook of her symptoms and injuries and categorized them broadly as brain and cognitive, gastrointestinal, lungs (respiratory), muscular and skin.</p>\n<p>These symptoms &#8220;affected everything,&#8221; she said. She was terminated from her job of 10 years because she &#8220;took too long&#8221; to return from the leave due to her vaccine injuries.</p>\n<p>Finding a new job has also been a challenge as she often received feedback that her medical [vaccine] exemption was denied by &#8220;corporate.&#8221; The loss of her employment also meant the loss of her health insurance and she added that &#8220;walk-ins were not accepting me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://vaccineinjurynews.com/\">VaccineInjuryNews.com</a> for more news related to the COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.</p>\n<p>Watch the below video that talks about the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/24fe79db-ad9b-460e-9647-b30d69661749\">overwhelming evidence of vaccine injuries</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thenewamerican\">New American channel on <em>Brighteon.com</em></a>.</p>\n<h3>More related stories:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-05-aussie-airlines-suppressing-vaccine-injuries-persecuting-unvaxxed.html\">Aussie air carriers suppressing vaccine injuries, persecuting unvaxxed pilots</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://euthanasia.news/2022-08-05-canada-normalize-euthanasia-children-suffering-vaccine-injuries.html\">Canadian hospice group pushes to normalize euthanasia of children who are &#8220;suffering&#8221; – many due to vaccine injuries</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vaccines.news/2022-07-31-did-brown-university-bury-covid-vaccine-injuries.html\">Wall of silence: Did Brown University bury COVID vaccine injuries to continue their injection mandate</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://propaganda.news/2022-06-15-media-insists-covid-shots-safe-and-effective.html\">Media absurdly insists COVID shots are &#8220;safe and effective&#8221; as vaccine injuries and deaths mount</a>.</p>\n<h4>Sources include:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/people-injured-covid-vaccines-stories/\">ChildrensHealthDefense.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.trialsitenews.com/groups/4/covid-vaccine-injury-support-group?fbclid=IwAR2vbj1NZfNug0fAAeeI-Kd0ObcLiDHaoYmYPP1093D39wedXUnk2g-8nGU\">TrialSiteNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/24fe79db-ad9b-460e-9647-b30d69661749\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-covid-vaccine-injuries-support-group-faces-censorship.html\" data-a2a-title=\"COVID-19 vaccine injury support group faces online censorship\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-covid-vaccine-injuries-support-group-faces-censorship.html&linkname=COVID-19%20vaccine%20injury%20support%20group%20faces%20online%20censorship\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-covid-vaccine-injuries-support-group-faces-censorship.html&linkname=COVID-19%20vaccine%20injury%20support%20group%20faces%20online%20censorship\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-covid-vaccine-injuries-support-group-faces-censorship.html&linkname=COVID-19%20vaccine%20injury%20support%20group%20faces%20online%20censorship\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-11-covid-vaccine-injuries-support-group-faces-censorship.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '110', '2022-08-12 04:27:05', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:14:03', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 06:58:11', '2032-08-10 06:58:11', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '165', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already has orchestrated two failed impeach-and-remove schemes, one that happened after he left office.</p>\n<p>And critics of the Democrats&#8217; schemes have said her partisan committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol essentially is her third barrage against Trump.</p>\n<p>Kerik was on The Balance with Eric Bolling, and explained, &#8220;If you remember back in 2016, right before he got elected, I was in Washington D.C.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was at a couple of different social events, and I hear people talking, they said the Democrats want this guy so bad that they wouldn&#8217;t put assassination behind it. And I&#8217;m gonna tell you something, they&#8217;ve tried impeachment, they&#8217;ve tried another impeachment, they&#8217;ve tried one investigation after another.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is about one thing: this is about stopping him from running in 2024. And I&#8217;m gonna tell you something, I&#8217;m not into conspiracies, I&#8217;m not into anti-government rhetoric. This is the first time in my lifetime that I would say I am deathly afraid for Donald Trump.

Countless LGBT activists, including many public-school teachers, have taken to proselytizing the new transgender salvation to America’s children, both on social media and within the schools themselves. Even Biden’s far-left Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fully supports taxpayer-funded amputations of healthy body parts of these vulnerable children, declaring ghoulishly, “We should help those have the life-affirming care that they need.” The result? Untold numbers of America’s kids are being led into lives of not just unending conflict, confusion, suffering, deformity and disability, but far too often – as multiple studies prove – suicide. The whole unbelievable story – including the underlying reasons, almost entirely unreported elsewhere, for what amounts to the most massive child sexual abuse campaign in American history – is explored as never before in the July issue of WND’s critically acclaimed Whistleblower magazine, titled “<a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/\">WHAT’S REALLY BEHIND THE TRANSGENDER CRAZE?</a>”</i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

Countless LGBT activists, including many public-school teachers, have taken to proselytizing the new transgender salvation to America’s children, both on social media and within the schools themselves. Even Biden’s far-left Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fully supports taxpayer-funded amputations of healthy body parts of these vulnerable children, declaring ghoulishly, “We should help those have the life-affirming care that they need.” The result? Untold numbers of America’s kids are being led into lives of not just unending conflict, confusion, suffering, deformity and disability, but far too often – as multiple studies prove – suicide. The whole unbelievable story – including the underlying reasons, almost entirely unreported elsewhere, for what amounts to the most massive child sexual abuse campaign in American history – is explored as never before in the July issue of WND’s critically acclaimed Whistleblower magazine, titled “<a href=\"https://superstore.wnd.com/whistleblower/\">WHAT’S REALLY BEHIND THE TRANSGENDER CRAZE?</a>”</i></p>\n<hr noshade size=\"1\" width=\"16%\">\n<p><i>For 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

And to make sure that that doesn’t happen.” George Friedman, STRATFOR CEO at The Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs</span></em></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_2\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Ukraine. It’s about Germany and, in particular, a pipeline that connects Germany to Russia called Nord Stream 2. Washington sees the pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at every turn. Even so, Nord Stream has pushed ahead and is now fully-operational and ready-to-go. Once German regulators provide the final certification, the gas deliveries will begin. German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean and inexpensive energy while Russia will see a significant boost to their gas revenues. It’s a win-win situation for both parties.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_3\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">The US Foreign Policy establishment is not happy about these developments. They don’t want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas because commerce builds trust and trust leads to the expansion of trade. As relations grow warmer, more trade barriers are lifted, regulations are eased, travel and tourism increase, and a new security architecture evolves. <b>In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners, there is no need for US military bases, no need for expensive US-made weapons and missile systems, and no need for NATO. </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>There’s also no need to transact energy deals in US Dollars or to stockpile US Treasuries to balance accounts. </b>Transactions between business partners can be conducted in their own currencies which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream.<b> It’s not just a pipeline, it’s a window into the future; a future in which Europe and Asia are drawn closer together into a massive free trade zone that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the US on the outside looking in.</b> </span></p>\n<p class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Warmer relations between Germany and Russia signal an end to the “unipolar” world order the US has overseen for the last 75 years. A German-Russo alliance threatens to hasten the decline of the Superpower that is presently inching closer to the abyss. This is why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream and keep Germany within its orbit. It’s a matter of survival.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_4\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">That’s where Ukraine comes into the picture. <b>Ukraine is Washington’s ‘weapon of choice’ for torpedoing Nord Stream and putting a wedge between Germany and Russia. </b>The strategy is taken from page one of the US Foreign Policy Handbook under the rubric: Divide and Rule.<b> </b></span></p>\n<p class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>Washington needs to create the perception that Russia poses a security threat to Europe. That’s the goal. They need to show that Putin is a bloodthirsty aggressor with a hair-trigger temper who cannot be trusted.</b> To that end, the media has been given the assignment of reiterating over and over again, “Russia is planning to invade Ukraine.” What’s left unsaid is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and that the US has invaded or toppled regimes in more than 50 countries in the same period of time, and that the US maintains over 800 military bases in countries around the world. None of this is reported by the media, instead the focus is on “evil Putin” who has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border threatening to plunge all of Europe into another bloody war.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_5\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">All of the hysterical war propaganda is created with the intention of manufacturing a crisis that can be used to isolate, demonize and, ultimately, splinter Russia into smaller units. <b>The real target, however, is not Russia, but Germany.</b> Check out this excerpt from an article by Michael Hudson at The Unz Review:</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_6\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\">“The only way left for U.S. diplomats to block European purchases <b>is to goad Russia into a military response</b> and then claim that avenging this response outweighs any purely national economic interest. As hawkish Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland, explained in a State Department press briefing on January 27: <b>“If Russia invades Ukraine one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”</b> (<a title=\"https://www.unz.com/mhudson/americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies/\" href=\"https://www.unz.com/mhudson/americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies/\">“America’s Real Adversaries Are Its European and Other Allies”</a>, The Unz Review)</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_7\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">There it is in black and white.<b> The Biden team wants to “goad Russia into a military response” in order to sabotage NordStream.</b> That implies there will be some kind of provocation designed to induce Putin to send his troops across the border to defend the ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country. If Putin takes the bait, the response would be swift and harsh. The media will excoriate the action as a threat to all of Europe while leaders around the world will denounce Putin as the “new Hitler”. This is Washington’s strategy in a nutshell, and <b>the whole production is being orchestrated with one goal in mind; to make it politically impossible for the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to wave NordStream through the final approval process. </b></span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_8\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Given what we know about Washington’s opposition to Nord Stream, readers may wonder why earlier in the year the Biden administration lobbied Congress NOT to impose more sanctions on the project. The answer to that question is simple: Domestic politics. Germany is currently decommissioning its nuclear power plants and needs natural gas to make up for the energy shortfall. Also, the threat of economic sanctions is a “turn-off” for Germans who see them as a sign of foreign meddling. “Why is the United States interfering in our energy decisions,” asks the average German. “Washington should mind its own business and stay out of ours.” This is precisely the response one would expect from any reasonable person.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_9\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Then, there’s this from Al Jazeera:</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_10\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>“Germans in the majority support the project, it is only parts of the elite and media who are against the pipeline</b>…</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_11\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>“The more the US talks about sanctioning or criticizes the project, the more it becomes popular in German society,”</b> said Stefan Meister, a Russia and eastern Europe expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations.” (<a title=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/25/ukraine-russia-what-is-nord-steam-2-and-why-is-it-contentious\" href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/25/ukraine-russia-what-is-nord-steam-2-and-why-is-it-contentious\">“Nord Stream 2: Why Russia’s pipeline to Europe divides the West”</a>, AlJazeera)</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_12\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">So, public opinion is solidly behind Nord Stream which helps to explain why Washington settled on a new approach. Sanctions are not going to work, so <b>Uncle Sam has flipped to Plan B: Create a big enough external threat that Germany will be forced to block the opening of the pipeline</b>. Frankly, the strategy smacks of desperation, but you have to be impressed by Washington’s perseverance. They might be down by 5 runs in the bottom of the 9th, but they haven’t thrown in the towel just yet. They’re going to give it one last shot and see if they can make some headway.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_13\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">On Monday, President Biden held his first joint-press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House. The ballyhoo surrounding the event was simply unprecedented.<b> Everything was orchestrated to manufacture a “crisis atmosphere” that Biden used to pressure the chancellor in the direction of US policy</b>. Earlier in the week, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki repeatedly said that a “Russian invasion was imminent.” Her comments were followed by State Department flak Nick Price opining that the Intel agencies had provided him with details of an alleged Russian-backed “false flag” operation they expected to take place in the near future in east Ukraine. Price’s warning was followed on Sunday morning by national security advisor Jake Sullivan claiming that a Russian invasion could happen at any time maybe “even tomorrow.” This was just days after Bloomberg News agency had published its sensational and utterly-false headline that “Russia Invades Ukraine”.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_14\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">Can you see the pattern here? Can you see how these baseless claims were all used to apply pressure to the unsuspecting German chancellor who seemed oblivious to the campaign that was aimed at him?</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_15\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">As one might expect, the final blow was delivered by the American president himself. During the press conference Biden stated emphatically that,</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_16\" class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"contents\"><b>“If Russia invades … there will no longer [be] a Nord Stream 2.. We will bring an end to it.”</b></span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_17\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">So, now Washington sets policy for Germany???</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_18\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">What insufferable arrogance!</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_19\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">The German chancellor was taken aback by Biden’s comments which clearly were not part of the original script. Even so,<b> Scholz never agreed to cancel Nord Stream and refused to even mention the pipeline by name. If Biden thought he could sandbag the leader of the world’s third biggest economy by cornering him in a public forum, he guessed wrong</b>. Germany remains committed to launching Nord Stream regardless of potential flare-ups in far-flung Ukraine. But that could change at any time. After all, who knows what incitements Washington might be planning in the near future? Who knows how many lives they are prepared to sacrifice in order to put a wedge between Germany and Russia? Who knows what risks Biden is willing to take to slow America’s decline and prevent a new “polycentric” world order from emerging? Anything could happen in the weeks ahead. Anything.</span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_20\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">For now, Germany is in the catbird seat. It’s up to Scholz to decide how the matter will be settled. <b>Will he implement the policy that best serves the interests of the German people or will he cave in to Biden’s relentless arm twisting?</b> Will he chart a new course that strengthens new alliances in the bustling Eurasian corridor or will he throw his support behind Washington’s crazed geopolitical ambitions? <b>Will he accept Germany’s pivotal role in a new world order</b>— in which many emerging centers of power share equally in global governance and where the leadership remains unflinchingly committed to multilateralism, peaceful development and security for all–<b> or will he try to prop up the tattered post-War system that has clearly outlived its shelf-life?</b></span></p>\n<p id=\"p_1_21\" class=\"container\"><span class=\"contents\">One thing is certain; whatever Germany decides is bound to affect us all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"container\">*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Since 1988 the company has put itself in a position to de facto control the Federal Reserve, most Wall Street mega-banks, including Goldman Sachs, the Davos World Economic Forum Great Reset, the Biden Administration and, if left unchecked, the economic future of our world. BlackRock is the epitome of what Mussolini called Corporatism, where an unelected corporate elite dictates top down to the population. </span></em></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">How the world’s largest “shadow bank” exercises this enormous power over the world ought to concern us. BlackRock since Larry Fink founded it in 1988 has managed to assemble unique financial software and assets that no other entity has. BlackRock’s Aladdin risk-management system, a software tool that can track and analyze trading, monitors more than $18 trillion in assets for 200 financial firms including the Federal Reserve and European central banks. He who “monitors” also knows, we can imagine. BlackRock has been called a financial “Swiss Army Knife — institutional investor, money manager, private equity firm, and global government partner <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/blackrock-rules-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rolled into one</a>.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Yet mainstream media treats the company as just another Wall Street financial firm.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">There is a seamless interface that ties the UN Agenda 2030 with the Davos World Economic Forum Great Reset and the nascent economic policies of the Biden Administration. That interface is BlackRock. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Team Biden and BlackRock</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">By now it should be clear to anyone who bothers to look, that the person who claims to be US President, 78-year old Joe Biden, is not making any decisions. He even has difficulty reading a teleprompter or answering prepared questions from friendly media without confusing Syria and Libya or even whether he is President. He is being micromanaged by a group of handlers to maintain a scripted “image” of a President while policy is made behind the scenes by others. It eerily reminds of the 1979 Peter Sellers film character, Chauncey Gardiner, in </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Being There</span><span lang=\"en-US\">. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">What is less public are the key policy persons running economic policy for Biden Inc. They are simply said, BlackRock. Much as Goldman Sachs ran economic policy under Obama and also Trump, today BlackRock is filling that key role. The deal apparently was sealed in January, 2019 when Joe Biden, then-candidate and long-shot chance to defeat Trump, went to meet with Larry Fink in New York, who reportedly told “working class Joe,” that, “<a href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/middle-class-joe-biden-courts-wall-street-oligarch-blackrocks-larry-fink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I’m here to help</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Now as President in one of his first appointees, Biden named Brian Deese to be the Director of the National Economic Council, the President’s main adviser for economic policy. One of the early Presidential Executive Orders dealt with economics and climate policy. That’s not surprising, as Deese came from Fink’s BlackRock where he was Global Head of Sustainable Investing. Before joining BlackRock, Deese held senior economic posts under Obama, including replacing John Podesta as Senior Adviser to the President where he worked alongside Valerie Jarrett. Under Obama, Deese played a key role in <a href=\"https://marketrealist.com/p/wally-adeyemo-blackrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">negotiating</a> the Global Warming Paris Accords.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In the key policy post as Deputy Treasury Secretary under Secretary Janet Yellen, we find Nigerian-born Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo. Adeyemo also comes from BlackRock where from 2017 to 2019 he was a senior adviser and Chief of Staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, after leaving the Obama Administration. His <a href=\"https://marketrealist.com/p/wally-adeyemo-blackrock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">personal ties</a> to Obama are strong, as Obama named him the first President of the Obama Foundation in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">And a third senior BlackRock person running economic policy in the Administration now is also unusual in several respects. Michael Pyle is the Senior Economic Adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. He came to Washington from the position as the Global Chief Investment Strategist at BlackRock where he oversaw the strategy for investing some $9 trillion of funds. Before joining BlackRock at the highest level, he had also been in the Obama Administration as a senior adviser to the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and in 2015 <a href=\"https://prospect.org/cabinet-watch/another-blackrock-veteran-will-join-biden-administration-michael-pyle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">became an adviser</a> to the Hillary Clinton presidential bid.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The fact that three of the most influential economic appointees of the Biden Administration come from BlackRock, and before that all from the Obama Administration, is noteworthy. There is a definite pattern and suggests that the role of BlackRock in Washington is far larger than we are being told.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">What is BlackRock?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Never before has a financial company with so much influence over world markets been so hidden from public scrutiny. That’s no accident. As it is technically not a bank making bank loans or taking deposits, it evades the regulation oversight from the Federal Reserve even though it does what most mega banks like HSBC or JP MorganChase do—buy, sell securities for profit. When there was a Congressional push to include asset managers such as BlackRock and Vanguard Funds under the post-2008 Dodd-Frank law as “systemically important financial institutions” or SIFIs, a huge lobbying push from BlackRock ended the threat. BlackRock is essentially a law onto itself. And indeed it is “systemically important” as no other, with possible exception of Vanguard, which is said to also be a major shareholder in BlackRock.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock founder and CEO Larry Fink is clearly interested in buying influence globally. He made former German CDU MP Friederich Merz head of BlackRock Germany when it looked as if he might succeed Chancellor Merkel, and former British Chancellor of Exchequer George Osborne as “political consultant.” Fink named former Hillary Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills to the BlackRock board when it seemed certain Hillary would soon be in the White House. </span></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">He has named former central bankers to his board and gone on to secure lucrative contracts with their former institutions. Stanley Fisher, former head of the Bank of Israel and also later Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve is now Senior Adviser at BlackRock. Philipp Hildebrand, former Swiss National Bank president, is vice chairman at BlackRock, where he oversees the BlackRock Investment Institute. Jean Boivin, the former deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, is the global <a href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-15/blackrock-s-ex-central-bankers-have-bold-vision-to-beat-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">head of research</a> at BlackRock’s investment institute.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock and the Fed</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">It was this ex-central bank team at BlackRock that developed an “emergency” bailout plan for Fed chairman Powell in March 2019 as financial markets appeared on the brink of another 2008 “Lehman crisis” meltdown. As “thank you,” the Fed chairman Jerome Powell named BlackRock in a no-bid role to manage all of the Fed’s corporate bond purchase programs, including bonds where BlackRock itself invests. Conflict of interest? A group of some 30 NGOs wrote to Fed Chairman Powell, “By giving BlackRock full control of this debt buyout program, the Fed… makes BlackRock even more systemically important to the financial system. Yet BlackRock is not subject to the regulatory scrutiny of even smaller systemically <a href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/06/blackrock-authored-the-bailout-plan-before-there-was-a-crisis-now-its-been-hired-by-three-central-banks-to-implement-the-plan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">important financial institutions</a>.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In a detailed report in 2019, a Washington non-profit research group, Campaign for Accountability, noted that, “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, implemented a strategy of lobbying, campaign contributions, and revolving door hires to fight off government regulation and establish itself as one of the most powerful <a href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/new-report-details-how-blackrock-fought-off-government-regulation-by-spending-big-in-washington/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial companies</a> in the world.”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The New York Fed hired BlackRock in March 2019 to manage its commercial mortgage-backed securities program and its $750 billion primary and secondary purchases of corporate bonds and ETFs in no-bid contracts. US financial journalists Pam and Russ Martens in critiquing that murky 2019 Fed bailout of Wall Street remarked, “for the first time in history, the Fed has hired BlackRock to “go direct” and buy up $750 billion in both primary and secondary corporate bonds and bond ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), a product of which BlackRock is one of the largest purveyors in the world.” They went on, “Adding further outrage, the BlackRock-run program will get $75 billion of the $454 billion in taxpayers’ money to eat the losses on its corporate bond purchases, which will include its own ETFs, which the Fed is allowing it to buy…”</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Fed head Jerome Powell and Larry Fink know each other well, apparently. Even after Powell gave BlackRock the hugely lucrative no-bid “go direct” deal, Powell continued to have the same BlackRock manage an estimated $25 million of Powell’s private securities investments. Public records show that in this time Powell held direct confidential phone calls with BlackRock CEO Fink. According to required financial disclosure, BlackRock managed to <a href=\"https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/08/fed-chair-powell-had-4-private-phone-calls-with-blackrocks-ceo-since-march-as-blackrock-manages-upwards-of-25-million-of-powells-personal-money-and-lands-3-no-bid-deals-with-the-fed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">double the value</a> of Powell’s investments from the year before! No conflict of interest, or?</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">A Very BlackRock in Mexico </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">BlackRock’s murky history in Mexico shows that conflicts of interest and influence-building with leading government agencies is not restricted to just the USA. PRI Presidential candidate Peña Nieto went to Wall Street during his campaign in November 2011. There he met Larry Fink. What followed the Nieto victory in 2012 was a tight relationship between Fink and Nieto that was riddled with <a href=\"https://campaignforaccountability.org/new-report-details-how-blackrock-built-its-mexican-infrastructure-business-through-cronyism-corruption-and-conflicts-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conflict of interest</a>, cronyism and corruption.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Most likely to be certain BlackRock was on the winning side in the corrupt new Nieto regime, Fink named 52-year-old Marcos Antonio Slim Domit, billionaire son of Mexico’s wealthiest and arguably most corrupt man, Carlos Slim, to BlackRock’s Board. Marcos Antonio, along with his brother Carlos Slim Domit, run the father’s huge business empire today. Carlos Slim Domit, the eldest son, was Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum Latin America in 2015, and currently serves as chairman of the board of America Movil where BlackRock is a major investor. Small cozy world. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">The father, Carlos Slim, at the time named by Forbes as World’s Richest Person, built an empire based around his sweetheart acquisition of Telemex (later America Movil). Then President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in effect gifted the telecom empire to Slim in 1989. Salinas later fled Mexico on charges of stealing more than $10 billion from state coffers. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">As with much in Mexico since the 1980s drug money apparently played a huge role with the elder Carlos Slim, father of BlackRock director Marcos Slim. In 2015 WikiLeaks released company internal emails from the private intelligence corporation, Stratfor. Stratfor writes in an April 2011 email, the time BlackRock is establishing its Mexico plans, that a US DEA Special Agent, William F. Dionne confirmed Carlos Slim’s ties to the Mexican drug cartels. Stratfor asks Dionne, “Billy, is the MX (Mexican) billionaire Carlos Slim linked to the narcos?” Dionne replies, “Regarding your <a href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https://www.telesurenglish.net/opinion/The-Mexican-Billionaire-Even-Ex-Presidents-Fear-Talking-About--20151201-0019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">question</a>, the MX telecommunication billionaire is.” </span><span lang=\"en-US\">In a country where 44% of the population lives in poverty you don’t become the world’s richest man in just two decades selling Girl Scout cookies. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Fink and Mexican PPP</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">With Marcos Slim on his BlackRock board and new president Enrique Peña Nieto, Larry Fink’s Mexican partner in Nieto Peña’s $590 billion PublicPrivatePartnership (PPP) alliance, BlackRock, was ready to reap the harvest. To fine-tune his new Mexican operations, Fink named former Mexican Undersecretary of Finance Gerardo Rodriguez Regordosa to direct BlackRock Emerging Market Strategy in 2013. Then in 2016 Peña Nieto appointed Isaac Volin, then head of BlackRock Mexico to be No. 2 at PEMEX where he presided over corruption, scandals and the largest loss in PEMEX history, $38 billion. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Peña Nieto had opened the huge oil state monopoly, PEMEX, to private investors for the first time since nationalization in the 1930s. The first to benefit was Fink’s BlackRock. Within seven months, BlackRock had secured $1 billion in PEMEX energy projects, many as the only bidder. During the tenure of Peña Nieto, one of the most controversial and least popular presidents, BlackRock prospered by the cozy ties. It soon was <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/blackrock-rules-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">engaged</a> in highly profitable (and corrupt) infrastructure projects under Peña Nieto including not only oil and gas pipelines and wells but also including toll roads, hospitals, gas pipelines and even prisons.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Notably, BlackRock’s Mexican “friend” Peña Nieto was also “friends” not only with Carlos Slim but with the head of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel, “El Chapo” Guzman. In court testimony in 2019 in New York Alex Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo’s “right-hand man,” testified that just after his election in 2012, Peña Nieto had requested $250 million from the Sinaloa Cartel before settling on $100 million. We <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46872414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can only guess</a> what for.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"en-US\">Larry Fink and WEF Great Reset </span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">In 2019 Larry Fink joined the Board of the Davos World Economic Forum, the Swiss-based organization that for some 40 years has advanced economic globalization. Fink, who is close to the WEF’s technocrat head, Klaus Schwab, of Great Reset notoriety, now stands positioned to use the huge weight of BlackRock to create what is potentially, if it doesn’t collapse before, the world’s largest Ponzi scam, ESG corporate investing. Fink with $9 trillion to leverage is pushing the greatest shift of capital in history into a scam known as ESG Investing. The UN “sustainable economy” agenda is being realized quietly by the very same global banks which have created the financial crises in 2008. This time they are preparing the Klaus Schwab WEF Great Reset by steering hundreds of billions and soon trillions in investment to their hand-picked “woke” companies, and away from the “not woke” such as oil and gas companies or coal. BlackRock since 2018 has been in the forefront to create a new investment infrastructure that picks “winners” or “losers” for investment according to how serious that company is about ESG—Environment, Social values and Governance.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">For example a company gets positive ratings for the seriousness of its hiring gender diverse management and employees, or takes measures to eliminate their carbon “footprint” by making their energy sources green or sustainable to use the UN term. How corporations contribute to a global sustainable governance is the most vague of the ESG, and could include anything from corporate donations to Black Lives Matter to supporting UN agencies such as WHO. Oil companies like ExxonMobil or coal companies no matter how clear are doomed as Fink and friends now promote their financial Great Reset or Green New Deal. This is why he cut a deal with the Biden presidency in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Follow the money. And we can expect that the New York Times will cheer BlackRock on as it destroys the world financial structures. Since 2017 BlackRock has been the paper’s largest shareholder. Carlos Slim was second largest. Even Carl Icahn, a ruthless Wall Street asset stripper, once <a href=\"https://journal-neo.org/2021/06/18/there-is-more-to-blackrock-than-you-might-imagine/%20https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/03/icahn-called-blackrock-an-extremely-dangerous-company-the-fed-has-chosen-it-to-manage-its-corporate-bond-bailout-programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">called</a> BlackRock, “an extremely dangerous company… I used to say, you know, the mafia has a better code of ethics than you guys.” </span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The theme was echoed by <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> who cited the income guarantee that is offered by countries like Denmark and Finland as a possible model for future development.</em></p>\n<p><em>Both Yang and Sanders argued that automation of production and other technological changes taking place in America have created a lag in job creation even as the economy flourishes, and that such a state can be responded to best with a universal basic income.</em></p>\n<p><em>There are advantages and disadvantages to a basic income that demand a thoughtful debate among citizens, in the media and in the halls of government. Such a debate is absolutely impossible in the current environment of oppression.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What we have now is a universal basic income being forced upon us without any democratic due process or accountability. It is known as the “corona virus stimulus check.”</strong> The newspapers tell us that we may get another $1,200 in the mail soon if congress passes a bill.</p>\n<p>So let us step back and think about this check for $1,200 that the government offers us. <strong>For many of us, the current shutdown has ended our economic lives, left us unemployed. The stimulus check is the only form of payment we receive. It is our de facto “universal basic income” –like it or not.</strong> But does this universal basic income allow us to be creative artists, to volunteer in our neighborhoods, to have the financial security that will allow us to fully realize ourselves?</p>\n<p>No, sadly, this universal basic income has been imposed upon us from above. Who knows who made up the idea. Certainly no one asked our opinions. We have no say in how much it is for, or who gets it. One thing is certain: for most of us, it is not anywhere near enough.</p>\n<p>Also, the debate on the universal basic income assumes that income is the critical issue for Americans. No serious economist believes this fraud. The primary issue in the United States is assets, ownership. And assets are dominated by a tiny handful of the rich.</p>\n<p><strong>The over-the-top response to COVID-19 has shut down the United States economy and led to massive unemployment in the course of just a few months.</strong> This pre-planned controlled demolition of the economy has left us begging for a universal basic income and we are getting it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, billionaires are getting billions of dollars in subsidies, as are CEOs. They do not need a universal basic income because they make their money off of speculation, off of the money they print up, off of what they take from us. COVID-19 is about a massive transfer of wealth and unless that transfer is stopped, basic income will be of little help.</p>\n<p><strong>Most of us are facing eviction, our small stores are being shut down by arbitrary regulations on our free movement, and no small number of us face starvation and homelessness in the next few months unless action is taken now.</strong></p>\n<p>Giving us a basic income without addressing the massive concentration of wealth, which has grown exponentially worse over just the last five months, is a recipe for disaster. Doing so after creating an environment in which we have no choice but to accept those checks is criminal.</p>\n<p>The super-rich have spent the last twelve years, and especially the last three months, printing up money through the Federal Reserve and giving it back to themselves. If we do not take that money back, economic inequality cannot be countered.</p>\n<p>Between five and ten trillion dollars disappeared while you were distracted. If we leave the artificially created economic disparity in the United States untouched, if we let the looters at the top keep their loot, the free money from the government will not be free. It will be paid for with your taxes (certainly not taxes on multinational corporations with their headquarters offshore) or it will raise the national debt and eat away at your buying power.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>We cannot grow our own food, we cannot produce our own energy, and we cannot create our own clothes, furniture, and other products for daily life. We can only use the money that we are paid by corporations to purchase products at big stores run by multinational corporations, offering products produced overseas by poorly paid workers.</p>\n<p>The government has become the toy of the rich and powerful. High government officials, judges and even middle-level officials are appointed with the backing of multinational corporations and investment banks. The politicians are even worse.</p>\n<p>The actual experts in government have been removed and government functions, which are essential, have been outsourced to private corporations who do today what the government did, but with a focus on short-term profits, and not on the people. These companies are paid with your tax dollars to do the job of government, but they never swore and oath to the constitution, and their primary mission is delivering profits to their owners.</p>\n<p>The redistribution of assets, the complete transparency of the government and the complete end to the unwarranted and dangerous influence of the wealthy, and of the banks and corporations that they control, over the formulation of policy must come before we can start to discuss basic income.</p>\n<p>We need to consider why the banks want to cultivate in us habits of dependency and passivity. After all, if all we can do is sit around watching TV until our stimulus check comes, we will be unable to organize ourselves into groups capable of taking action, we will be unable to build our own economies.</p>\n<p>Let us talk for a moment about the relationship between technology and the proposed universal basic income. The argument advanced by Yang and Sanders was that automation, and the growth of AI and other technologies, are reducing jobs because they are not being formed in other sectors even as productivity increases. Therefore, we need a UBI to assure that workers displaced by new technologies have employment and can adapt to a new work reality.</p>\n<p>It is assumed that, just as the sun rises in the East, automation, the implementation of AI and the end of human to human interactions is a natural law that cannot be violated, that is beyond the realm of policy discussion.</p>\n<p>But are we truly forced to tear apart the natural order of society in order to satiate the cruel god of technology demanding endless sacrifice for the sake of an inevitable fourth industrial revolution, for the sake of the inevitable domination of the Earth by automation, driver-less cars, robots and drones? Is the internet of things truly the Kingdom Come?</p>\n<p>Is the promotion of AI (artificial intelligence) in accord with God’s covenant with man? Or is it rather a scheme to increase profits for the few, and drive the common man, the common woman, into poverty and dependency?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question is not obvious. It demands an open discussion involving experts on society, on technology, on governance and on economics, but also ordinary citizens who understand better than anyone else what the impact of technology can be. Moreover, the discussion should be transparent and scientific in nature, leaving no space for the wealthy who benefit from automation and AI to disguise their wish list as scientific truth.</p>\n<p>Productivity without job growth is the standard line used to justify this basic income. Productivity is the holy cow that cannot be approached by any but the anointed high priests, a false concept cooked up to justify just about anything. It is not the law of gravity or the second law of thermodynamics. It is the biased and warped idea that holds that certain forms of economic activity to be more important than others.</p>\n<p>If you spend the day helping your sick mother, tending vegetables in the community farm, volunteering with the handicapped, or playing with your children, that activity is not considered productive by those who make up the rules of productivity.</p>\n<p>But if you destroy forests or farmland to build unnecessary shopping malls, if you poison rivers and lakes with the run off from factory farms, or from uranium mines, or if you wage wars abroad, that is consider productivity. The gap between employment and productivity is most certainly not simply a result of technological change.</p>\n<p>Finally, we need to consider where the United States stands in history at this moment, and where we have come from, before we can talk about where we are going.</p>\n<p>In the previous generation there was a profound ideological and economic competition between the market economies of the United States and Europe and the socialist economies of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. We refer to it, imprecisely, as the Cold War.</p>\n<p>The United States held up the ideal that there was no limit to what the individual could achieve through his or her efforts and we argued that individual freedoms were more critical than the common good.</p>\n<p>The socialist economies assumed that economic equality was central for a healthy society and took preemptive measures to assure a relatively egalitarian economy.</p>\n<p>I grew up in the United States. We assumed that we could have economic fairness and at the same time the ability obtain rewards in accord to our special efforts in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>But, what we assumed to be a natural state was not at all natural. The massive accumulation of wealth, the exploitation of workers, and the abuse of child labor were standard practice in the late nineteenth century, and even into the 1930s.</p>\n<p>But the existence of the socialist block out there, imperfect though it was, put unending pressure on the United States to modify the system and to allow for a more just society — granted there were profound limits.</p>\n<p>In the late 1930s, the threat of revolution within the United States also was real and it forced action on labor issues that would otherwise have been ignored.</p>\n<p>We may not have been aware of that pressure, but it made things like welfare and the minimum wage possible.</p>\n<p>The salaries of CEOs were capped. Taxes on the rich went up to 90% and there were no billionaires, or offshore tax havens. America was not that way because the rich were virtuous. It was that way because there was endless pressure.</p>\n<p>When the so-called “communist block” was subject to commercialization from the 1990s on, and the ideological opposition dropped off, the United States slowly shifted back to the ruthless market economy it had once enjoyed, one in which workers were expendable. This time, however, automation and drones, AI and robots, made it possible to engage in an even more ruthless experiment.</p>\n<p>But the shifts in American society, like climate change, were too slow for us to grasp. We were too caught up with email and Facebook to notice.</p>\n<p>We could not perceive that the rules we had accepted had disappeared, that a ruthless shiny brave new world had been born.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we cannot discuss a universal basic income in the United States until we start to create a culture, a system, in which some counter force exists to stand up for the interests of ordinary citizens. That is the ultimate question. That counter force, however, must be built by you, by me and by us, and not by experts or by politicians and most certainly not by corporations with their drones and robots.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

said.</p>\n<p>In regard to overall adaptive immunity, Cole describes, “post-vaccine, what we are seeing is a drop in your killer T-cells” that “keep all other viruses in check,” leaving the patient susceptible to a variety of illnesses.</p>\n<p>In January, data leaks given by three “decorated high-ranking soldiers who are doctors and public health officials,” in sworn declarations under penalty

From now on, it is up to the <i>individuals</i> to make the choice for themselves without the government telling them what to do.</p>\n<p>Entitled &#8220;Guidance for Minimizing the Impact of Covid-19,&#8221; the CDC&#8217;s new release, as explained by <i>NPR</i>, includes the following recommendations:</p>\n\nThose exposed to the virus are no longer required to quarantine.\nUnvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people.\nStudents can stay in class after being exposed to the virus.\nIt is no longer recommended to screen (test) those without symptoms.\n\n<p>Other new recommendations include only masking if you have been exposed to or tested &#8220;positive&#8221; for Chinese Germs, as well as official recognition by the CDC that a healthy person who is unvaccinated now has the same immunity as a fully jabbed person.</p>\n<p>These changes represent a major deviation from what the CDC has been pushing up until, well, <i>now</i>. For the past two years, the CDC did not want anyone to appear in public unmasked. It also wanted everyone to be force-injected in order to live. (Related: At one point, there <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-18-second-holocaust-cdc-covid-camps-no-leaving.html\" target=\"_blank\">was talk</a> about the CDC setting up covid &#8220;Green Zone&#8221; quarantine [concentration?] camps.)</p>\n<p>Now, suddenly, the CDC is stressing the idea of <i>individual</i> decision-making when it comes to health. In fact, the CDC mentions the word <i>individual</i> some 10 different times in the new guidance.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;That is consistent with where we are in the pandemic right now,&#8221; says Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really think there are many state or local jurisdictions that are feeling they&#8217;re going to need to start making mandates.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>CDC says almost everyone is now immune to covid – the <i>plandemic</i> is over</h2>\n<p>The CDC&#8217;s Greta Massetti further explained that the agency&#8217;s new position is that, vaccinated or unvaccinated, at least 95 percent of the general population is now fully immune to the Fauci Flu, and that no further tyranny is necessary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on the latest &#8230; data, it&#8217;s around 95 percent of the population,&#8221; she is quoted as saying. &#8220;And so, it really makes the most sense to not differentiate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One area of concern with the CDC&#8217;s new guidance is the recommendation that children at school be masked rather than quarantined after being so-called &#8220;exposed&#8221; to the virus.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The practice of handling exposures would involve masking rather than a quarantine,&#8221; Massetti said about how children in K-12 should be handled.</p>\n<p>Massetti stopped short of declaring the <i>plandemic</i> to be over in the same way this writer is, but she did essentially declare it to be over in so many words – at least as far as everyday life is concerned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This guidance acknowledges that the pandemic is not over, but also helps us move to a point where Covid-19 no longer severely disrupts our daily lives,&#8221; Massetti said. &#8220;We know that Covid-19 is here to stay.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Truthfully, there never should have been any disruption in the first place. While it is great that the CDC is backing off from medical fascism, the damage is already done in the form of economic devastation, lost lives and livelihoods, and broken supply chains.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How many poor souls could have been saved if this happened from the beginning?&#8221; asked a commenter. &#8220;The lawyers stand to make billions on this in lawsuits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The latest news about the Fauci Flu can be found at <a href=\"http://pandemic.news\" target=\"_blank\">Pandemic.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/posts/cdc-covid-guideline-update-finally-allows-individuals-to-make-their-own-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\">Infowars.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-08-18-second-holocaust-cdc-covid-camps-no-leaving.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-13-cdc-recognizes-individuals-health-choices-covid-vaccination.html\" data-a2a-title=\"CDC finally recognizes right of “individuals” to make their own health choices – no more forced covid vaccinations or quarantines\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-13-cdc-recognizes-individuals-health-choices-covid-vaccination.html&linkname=CDC%20finally%20recognizes%20right%20of%20%E2%80%9Cindividuals%E2%80%9D%20to%20make%20their%20own%20health%20choices%20%E2%80%93%20no%20more%20forced%20covid%20vaccinations%20or%20quarantines\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-13-cdc-recognizes-individuals-health-choices-covid-vaccination.html&linkname=CDC%20finally%20recognizes%20right%20of%20%E2%80%9Cindividuals%E2%80%9D%20to%20make%20their%20own%20health%20choices%20%E2%80%93%20no%20more%20forced%20covid%20vaccinations%20or%20quarantines\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-13-cdc-recognizes-individuals-health-choices-covid-vaccination.html&linkname=CDC%20finally%20recognizes%20right%20of%20%E2%80%9Cindividuals%E2%80%9D%20to%20make%20their%20own%20health%20choices%20%E2%80%93%20no%20more%20forced%20covid%20vaccinations%20or%20quarantines\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-13-cdc-recognizes-individuals-health-choices-covid-vaccination.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '107', '2022-08-13 06:18:01', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:02:06', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 19:02:41', '2032-08-10 19:02:41', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '162', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', '');/**ABDB**/
