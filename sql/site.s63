In the words of one Democratic strategist, &#8220;The vibe has shifted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To quote the television program &#8220;Ted Lasso,&#8221; it&#8217;s the hope that kills.</p>\n<p>Democrats feel buoyant right now because their so-called Inflation Reduction Act is making it through Congress. The CHIPS Act has likewise passed. Democrats feel like they have some momentum. It is understandable. It also comes as late summer and early fall polling gives the traditional boost to Democrats.</p>\n<div id=\"IC1-ad\" class=\"sponsor IC1\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"IC1\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Many Democrats believe the shift in polling is over the Supreme Court ending Roe v. Wade. They see Republicans nominating supposedly weak candidates. They see former President Donald Trump suddenly back on the front page with a <a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/hammer-can-draw-3-conclusions-mar-lago-raid-terrifying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">federal search of Mar-a-Lago</a> and think voters will steer clear of the GOP. They see a lot, and, with the polling boost, they have more emotional hope than rational belief.</p>\n<p>Polling frequently shifts to the Democrats this time of year. In 2020, Democrats had a 6.8 percent edge over the GOP in the polling average for the generic congressional ballot. No one saw the GOP wave coming that nearly cost the Democrats the House. While the polling average was 6.8 percent, the reality came out to 3.1 percent more votes for Democrats.</p>\n<div id=\"in-article-trending\" class=\"in-article-more inner-content\">\n<div class=\"in-article-more-label\">Trending:</div>\n<div class=\"in-article-more-right\">\n<a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/eric-trump-reveals-family-footage-really-happened-mar-lago-raid/\" data-type=\"Internal link\" data-type-location=\"in-content-trending\">Eric Trump Reveals His Family Has Footage of What Really Happened During Mar-a-Lago Raid</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>After 2020, pollsters tried to assess what went wrong and came away with mixed reactions and no clue how to fix the problem. The consensus is Republicans are not responding to pollsters.</p>\n<p>Now, in August, with the supposed &#8220;vibe shift,&#8221; the wind at their backs and a supposed surge in young voter support, Democrats are statistically tied with Republicans on the generic ballot, which is bad for Democrats. A tie tends to bode well for the GOP.</p>\n<div id=\"IC2-ad\" class=\"sponsor IC2\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"IC2\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Then there is the real-world data Democrats prefer not to discuss.

One in two Americans cannot afford to fill up their car with gas. One in five Americans must put stuff back when they check out at the grocery store because they cannot afford their grocery bill.</p>\n<p>Economists talk about an inflation problem. Americans increasingly realize they have an affordability problem. Since Democrats in Congress passed Biden&#8217;s COVID-19 stimulus plan in March 2021, real-world wages have declined every month. Americans can no longer afford things they once could.</p>\n<p>Gas prices are down, but still higher than when Biden took office. Gas is up 44 percent. Meat, poultry and fish are up 9.3 percent. Milk is up 15.6 percent. Eggs are up 38 percent. Baby food is up 15 percent and there is still a formula shortage. Public transportation costs are up 19 percent. Airline fares are up 27.7 percent. Real average hourly earnings are down 3 percent.</p>\n<p>Americans are falling further behind and seeing their savings wiped out just as a recession is forming. They cannot afford Biden and the Democrats remaining in charge. They may not like Republicans, but they do remember this situation did not exist under Biden&#8217;s predecessor.</p>\n<div id=\"IC3-ad\" class=\"sponsor IC3\">\n<div class=\"ad-notice flipboard-remove\" fl:fl-noexcerpt=\"true\">Advertisement - story continues below</div>\n<div id=\"IC3\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Democrats can get their friends in the media to spin tales of vibes and momentum, but the data tells the real story.

This clot was provided by embalmer Richard Hirschman,', 'and these clots are being widely reported in the bodies of people who have &#8220;died suddenly&#8221; in the weeks or months after receiving one or more covid vaccinations.</p>\n<p>According to rigorous analysis based on excess death data &#8212; <a href=\"https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/do-you-know-how-many-people-have\">summarized nicely by Steve Kirsh at Substack</a> &#8212; there are currently around 10,000 people dying each day from covid vaccines. Anywhere from 5 to 12 million fatalities have likely occurred worldwide so far, and with these self-assembling clots continuing to gain size and mass inside the bodies of those who have received the mRNA experimental medicine injections, it is certain that many people who have not yet died from the vaccines will experience death in the coming months and years.</p>\n<p>Kirsch has roughly estimated that 1 person is currently dead for every 1,000 doses of covid vaccines that are administered. This number will almost certainly increase with time, as the clots that are causing so much death appear to be continuing to &#8220;grow&#8221; (self-assemble) inside the blood vessels and arteries of vaccine victims. Thus, the final toll of covid vaccines will only be experienced over a period of several years and could be orders of magnitude higher, potentially 1 in 100 or even 1 in 10, although we will have to watch <em>excess deaths</em> carefully over the next several years to know where this post-vaccine death phenomenon levels out.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>So far, over 12 billion covid vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. Over 600 million doses have been administered in the United States, and Kirsch estimates that 600,000 Americans have likely already been killed by covid vaccines in the USA alone. (That&#8217;s about 12 times higher than the total casualties of US soldiers in the Vietnam War, for comparison.)</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a photo that I took of one of these clots, under a lab microscope:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-628950\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Nanowire-clot-20x.png.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"405\"></p>\n<h2>Pursuing the mystery of the post-vaccine clots</h2>\n<p>Dr. Jane Ruby has been one of the researchers at the forefront of attempting to determine the composition of these clots as well as their mechanism of action in causing fatalities in victims. Dr. Ruby connected us with Hirschman and helped arrange for the clot samples which we have tested via ICP-MS in our ISO-accredited, 17025 approved laboratory which specializes in food and water analysis.</p>\n<p>In full disclosure, our laboratory is accredited, audited, inspected and validated for ICP-MS testing in food and water samples, as well as other areas such as cannabinoid quantitation analysis in hemp extract samples. However, the accreditation scope of our lab does not specifically encompass human biological samples, as we do not offer such testing to the public. Nevertheless, we routinely test dog food and cat food samples which are, of course, composed of animal flesh and ground blood vessels, meat tissue, cartilage and other animal-derived biological structures, and we are using the exact same sample preparation, digestion, analysis and reporting methods for post-vaccine clot samples. We also routinely test beef, poultry, fish and other meat samples. Thus, we are highly confident in the accuracy of these results. Furthermore, we did not see any failures during the sample prep process. The entire clot was dissolved in nitric acid, meaning its elements went into solution and were able to be analyzed via ICP-MS.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of some of the clots found in the body of the deceased:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-648661\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Clot-Hirschman-vial-550.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"412\"></p>\n<p>These ICP-MS tests were conducted on June 23 of this year. We have delayed public release of the results in order to allow time to share these numbers with colleagues and to invite feedback from others. These PDFs have also been shared privately with Dr. Jane Ruby and others. No one with expertise in this field has indicated any apparent problems or concerns about this analysis. If anything, the ICP-MS analysis is rather straightforward: Samples are &#8220;digested&#8221; into nitric acid, this acid is nebulized into a liquid stream which goes through a plasma torch, gets ionized and then directed through a quadrupole assembly that sorts the elements by their mass-to-charge ratios. Each individual element is scanned and counted on a PMT (Photo Multiplier Tube) which translates individual elements into electrical current that can be accurately counted. These results are mapped against external standards which are NIST traceable to provide very accurate calibration curves, which means the quantitation data are extremely reliable.</p>\n<p>We used 0.4528 grams of the clot as the sample mass in this case:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-648666\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Clot-sample-prep-vial-400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\"></p>\n<p>For a primer on ICP-MS and why it is so accurate, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719745/\">see this NIH article</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-648667\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Clot-nitric-acid-digestion-550.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"315\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>ICP-MS analysis results reveal that these clots are not made of blood &#8211; they are not &#8220;blood clots&#8221;</h2>\n<p>Although we intend to conduct more tests on clots and blood samples, the data we see so far make it clear that these clots are not &#8220;blood clots.&#8221; They are not simply made of congealed blood.</p>\n<p>How do we know this? Because the elemental ratios and densities are vastly different. Consider the following comparison chart, based on our ICP-MS results (see full results below), and notice the stark differences between the elemental concentrations in blood vs. clot among nutritive &#8220;marker&#8221; elements such as iron and magnesium:</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Element</strong></td>\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Blood Results</strong></td>\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Clot Results</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Mg (magnesium)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">35 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1.7 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">K (potassium)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1893 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">12.5 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Fe (iron)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">462 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">20.6 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Zn (zinc)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">7.9 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">2.4 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Cl (chlorine)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">930,000 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">290,000 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">P (phosphorous)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1130 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">4900 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see, the post-vaccine clot sample <strong>only contains 4.4% of the iron that would be seen in human blood</strong>. This alone is confirmation that this clots is not a &#8220;blood clot.&#8221; In addition, note the near-total lack of potassium (K) in the clot sample. The clot contains less than 0.6% of the potassium as human blood. It&#8217;s a similar story with magnesium, too.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-648662\" src=\"wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Clot-microscope-shot-550.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"390\"></p>\n<h2>Several electrically conductive elements were higher in the clot</h2>\n<p>In addition to the nutritive elements shown above, we noticed a peculiar pattern among electrically conductive elements such as sodium (Na), aluminum (Al) and tin (Sn). For the following table, please note that the tin and sodium results come from a separate &#8220;semiquant&#8221; report which is less accurate than the &#8220;fullquant&#8221; analysis used for all the other elements shown here. In essence, the semiquant numbers are accurate in terms of relative concentrations from one sample to the next, but they are not compared to calibrated external samples, so the actual (absolute) concentration reported does not have the confidence interval of the fullquant results:</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Element</strong></td>\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Blood Results</strong></td>\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Clot Results</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Na (sodium)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1050 ppm*</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1500 ppm*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Sn (tin)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">163 ppb*</td>\n<td width=\"180\">942 ppb*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"180\">Al (aluminum)</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1.3 ppm</td>\n<td width=\"180\">1.6 ppm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* = SemiQuant results, not FullQuant</p>\n<p>With sodium being nearly 50% higher in the clot, and tin showing an increase of 588%, we can only conclude that <strong>the self-assembling clot is, in effect, &#8220;harvesting&#8221; or concentrating certain elements from circulating blood as clot assembly is taking place</strong>. It is noteworthy that many of these elements are conductive. Aluminum, for example, is the most common alternative to copper for use in electrical wiring. Sodium is an alkali metal that is highly conductive, and tin is used as the primary component in solder alloys used to manufacture or repair circuit boards.</p>\n<p>You can see the numbers on elemental conductivity at <a href=\"https://www.angstromsciences.com/elements-electrical-conductivity\">this electrical conductivity reference table from Angstrom Sciences</a>.</p>\n<p>One conclusion is inescapable: <strong>The clot is almost entirely lacking key marker elements that would be present in human blood (such as iron and potassium) yet shows significantly higher concentrations of elements that are used in electronics and circuitry</strong>.</p>\n<p>We invite the reader to draw your own conclusion of the explanation behind that, merely noting that the patents of Dr. Charles Lieber may be of special interest.</p>\n<p>This analysis, notably, does not answer any question of whether these clots are &#8220;alive&#8221; or dead (like hair and nails). My own professional opinion is that these clots are not living structures. They appear to be self-assembling <em>dead</em> biostructures, from what we can see so far. But that&#8217;s just an initial assessment and may change with additional observations or findings. Prions, for example, are self-assembling but non-living biostructures too. They are essentially mis-folded proteins that spread throughout the brain (or other regions), causing morphological alterations that nullify both the normal structure and function of neurological cells. Something does not have to be alive in order to be self-assembling. Even viruses, as described by traditional virology, are dead structures which are nevertheless self-assembling and can &#8220;grow&#8221; in size and mass in terms of their aggregate population.</p>\n<p>The following microscopy picture, taken at our lab at around 1500 x magnification, shows what appears to be a repeating structure on a wire-looking protrusion from one of these clots. In case you were wondering, is not a human hair.

Because of this, <a href=\"https://justthenews.com/government/federal-agencies/cdc-walk-back-covid-guidance-vindicates-legal-challenges-mandates\" target=\"_blank\">say lawyers</a>, those suing for damages over the mandates now have an even stronger case against the government and every institution that engaged in medical tyranny.</p>\n<p>The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) says it fully expects that defendants in natural immunity challenges will try to argue that such lawsuits are now moot because of the CDC&#8217;s backtracking. But according to attorney Jenin Younes, those cases are still fully valid, no matter the CDC shenanigan of the day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; because we argued that their constitutional rights were already violated, and we are seeking recognition of that going forward, the courts should not dismiss the appeals (or cases still pending in lower courts) on mootness grounds,&#8221; Younes wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>At least four separate NCLA cases are potentially affected by the CDC&#8217;s policy reversals, including one against <a href=\"https://msu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Michigan State University</i></a>&#8216;s employee mandate, another against Rhode Island&#8217;s healthcare worker mandate, and a number of class-action suits against federal employees and federal contractors.</p>\n<h2>Every American negatively affected by covid mandates needs to sue the CDC</h2>\n<p>Attorney Michael Senger is outraged over the CDC&#8217;s about-face, seeing as how millions of workers, students, and others lost their jobs, were told they could not receive an education, or were forced to take unwanted jobs while facing exclusion &#8220;from everyday life activities and basic medical care,&#8221; all because of &#8220;a differentiation that the CDC now admits does not make sense.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Senger was involved with a now-dismissed Big Tech case that is seeking to be reinstated.</p>\n<p>There are other cases as well within the military, for instance, which is not changing its jab mandate requirements despite the changes made to the CDC guidance.</p>\n<p>Attorney R. Davis Younts, who successfully represented a Navy lieutenant in a mandate challenge from back in the spring, says the military &#8220;absolutely should&#8221; change its policy &#8220;because the whole justification for denying religious accommodation [requests] is that there&#8217;s no safe alternative to the vaccine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now that the CDC has admitted that the shots are medically useless, Younts hopes that military servicemen resisting them will resubmit their RARs based on the fact that the CDC&#8217;s position on the matter has changed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It seems like every day the FDA or the CDC or some report continues to confirm what we&#8217;ve been saying: that there&#8217;s no reason for these shots,&#8221; says Liberty Counsel Chairman Mat Staver.</p>\n<p>Liberty Counsel is actively challenging the jab requirement in the armed forces, and Staver has promised to provide updates about the &#8220;various different courts we&#8217;re in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is another mile marker in the long march of incompetence from Washington bureaucrats that claims to follow &#8216;science&#8217; yet this science has been out for well over a year and has been ignored by the CDC and the corporations that are clearly state actors,&#8221; added U.S. Freedom Flyers co-founder Joshua Yoder, whose group challenged jab mandates for pilots.</p>\n<p>Yoder says that regardless of what the CDC is saying now, its prior mandates caused &#8220;unimaginable, unquantifiable damage&#8221; to people&#8217;s lives. And simply changing the narrative now &#8220;will not exempt them from accountability,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, both adults and children alike who were forced to take the jabs are now suffering from heart inflammation and other health damage that is more than likely permanent.</p>\n<p>The latest Chinese Virus-related news can be found at <a href=\"http://pandemic.news\" target=\"_blank\">Pandemic.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-13-cdc-recognizes-individuals-health-choices-covid-vaccination.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://justthenews.com/government/federal-agencies/cdc-walk-back-covid-guidance-vindicates-legal-challenges-mandates\" target=\"_blank\">JustTheNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-americans-sue-covid-mandates-cdc-backtracks-plandemic.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Our turn: Americans have every right to sue over covid mandates, especially now that the CDC is backtracking on its guidance\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-americans-sue-covid-mandates-cdc-backtracks-plandemic.html&linkname=Our%20turn%3A%20Americans%20have%20every%20right%20to%20sue%20over%20covid%20mandates%2C%20especially%20now%20that%20the%20CDC%20is%20backtracking%20on%20its%20guidance\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-americans-sue-covid-mandates-cdc-backtracks-plandemic.html&linkname=Our%20turn%3A%20Americans%20have%20every%20right%20to%20sue%20over%20covid%20mandates%2C%20especially%20now%20that%20the%20CDC%20is%20backtracking%20on%20its%20guidance\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-americans-sue-covid-mandates-cdc-backtracks-plandemic.html&linkname=Our%20turn%3A%20Americans%20have%20every%20right%20to%20sue%20over%20covid%20mandates%2C%20especially%20now%20that%20the%20CDC%20is%20backtracking%20on%20its%20guidance\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-americans-sue-covid-mandates-cdc-backtracks-plandemic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-17 12:55:51', '82', '', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '2032-08-14 22:50:20', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '8', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Rather, the latest policy focus has to do with ensuring that social media platforms can automatically censor as much countervailing information as possible using the latest technology.</p>\n<p>Specifically, <a href=\"https://reclaimthenet.org/wef-ai-censor-hate-speech-and-misinformation/\">as reported by <em>Reclaim The Net</em></a>, the WEF wants social media platforms to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) in order to combine with human censors to strip the platforms of any political, social, cultural, economic, or policy viewpoints the globalist elite disagree with.</p>\n<p>“By uniquely combining the power of innovative technology, off-platform intelligence collection and the prowess of subject-matter experts who understand how threat actors operate, scaled detection of online abuse can reach near-perfect precision,” the organization claims.</p>\n<p><em>Reclaim The Net</em> noted:</p>\n<p><em>But what is this supposed to mean?</em></p>\n<p><em>At some point toward the end, the WEF finally spits it out (but spoiler: it still doesn’t make a whole lot of sense): instead of relying on what is throughout the article continuously and erroneously referred to as “AI” – the WEF says it is proposing “a new framework: rather than relying on AI to detect at scale and humans to review edge cases, an intelligence-based approach is crucial.”</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p><em>It’s well worth quoting the entire techno-bubble word salad that is supposed to be the sales pitch of the writeup.</em></p>\n<p>“By bringing human-curated, multi-language, off-platform intelligence into learning sets, AI will then be able to detect nuanced, novel abuses at scale, before they reach mainstream platforms. Supplementing this smarter automated detection with human expertise to review edge cases and identify false positives and negatives and then feeding those findings back into training sets will allow us to create AI with human intelligence baked in,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/online-abuse-artificial-intelligence-human-input\">the WEF notes in its blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>In this way – “trust and safety teams can stop threats rising online before they reach users,” the organization continued.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As the internet has evolved, so has the dark world of online harms. Trust and safety teams (the teams typically found within online platforms responsible for removing abusive content and enforcing platform policies) are challenged by an ever-growing list of abuses, such as child abuse, extremism, disinformation, hate speech and fraud; and increasingly advanced actors misusing platforms in unique ways,&#8221; the post adds.</p>\n<p>The WEF post goes on to argue that platforms adding more human censors isn&#8217;t enough: That technology should be used to impose more of it programmatically.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The solution, however, is not as simple as hiring another roomful of content moderators or building yet another block list. Without a profound familiarity with different types of abuse, an understanding of hate group verbiage, fluency in terrorist languages and nuanced comprehension of disinformation campaigns, trust and safety teams can only scratch the surface,&#8221; the post argues.</p>\n<p>Of course, what constitutes &#8220;misinformation&#8221; and &#8220;abuse&#8221; is always highly arbitrary; far-left platforms think most conservative viewpoints are wrong and &#8216;triggering,&#8217; as conservatives themselves are compared to and likened to &#8220;Nazis&#8221; and &#8220;fascists&#8221; &#8212; therefore, their opinions are fascist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A more sophisticated approach is required. By uniquely combining the power of innovative technology, off-platform intelligence collection and the prowess of subject-matter experts who understand how threat actors operate, scaled detection of online abuse can reach near-perfect precision,&#8221; the WEF Forum post claims.</p>\n<p>The fact is, the mainstream social media apps and platforms <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2019-11-18-social-media-censorship-reaches-new-heights-twitter.html\">are going to be used from here on out to shape and guide public opinion</a>, not serve as a true reflection of it.

According to Steve Kirsch, a conservative estimate is <a href=\"https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/do-you-know-how-many-people-have\" target=\"_blank\">around 12 million people</a>, a figure 40 times higher than', 'the number of Americans who died during World War II.</p>\n<p>Kirsch says a reasonable way to estimate covid jab deaths is to divide the number of doses by 1,000. Based on the 600 million doses delivered just in the United States, this amounts to 600,000 deaths, which he says &#8220;is right in the ballpark.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An even more conservative calculation is to divide the number of doses by 2,500. This is the method Mathew Crawford used to conclude that 411 people die per one million doses of shot administered. (Related: Remember when the medical establishment was doing everything possible to <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-07-09-post-covid-vaccine-deaths-not-being-autopsied.html\" target=\"_blank\">avoid autopsying</a> the bodies of people who took covid &#8220;vaccines&#8221; from the likes of Pfizer?)</p>\n<p>As a type of independent peer review, Kirsch offered up a $1 million reward to anyone who is able to debunk Crawford&#8217;s figure. So far, nobody has even attempted to refute it.</p>\n<p>Using Crawford&#8217;s conservative estimate, the global total of covid jab deaths is around five million, or only 16 times the number of Americans killed in WWII.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are approaching the 6M Jews killed in the Holocaust over a period of 12 years,&#8221; Kirsch writes. &#8220;But we are killing people worldwide at a rate at least 6X faster than the Germans did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are killing nearly close to 10,000 people every single day (the latest rate was roughly 8.46 million doses a day).&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<h2>Fauci Flu shots are a kiss of death</h2>\n<p>Since 385,000 babies are born every day, this killing spree can theoretically go on <i>forever</i>, Kirsch notes – even if the birth rate ends up dropping by 90 percent due to the long-term sterilizing effects of the shots.</p>\n<p>No matter how you look at it, a <i>lot</i> of people are dying from these things. And governments have yet to acknowledge that fact, or the fact that <a href=\"http://vaccinedeaths.com\">covid jab deaths are far higher</a> than actual covid deaths – assuming covid is even real as the virus they claim it is.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are killing an awful lot of people, but world leaders are looking the other way and saying nothing while all of us watch the high number of death reports in the media of people who died &#8216;unexpectedly&#8217; and hear no explanation from the medical community or the CDC,&#8221; Kirsch says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are supposed to trust that they have things well in hand, even though they won&#8217;t appear on camera in front of anyone who doesn&#8217;t have scripted, pre-approved questions. The vaccine is never mentioned in any of these unexplained death reports.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Oddly enough – or perhaps not to readers in the know – almost nobody who refused the shots is getting sick with &#8220;covid&#8221; anymore. The only people falling ill or dying are those who got &#8220;fully vaccinated,&#8221; &#8220;boosters&#8221; included.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CDC will not require medical examiners to do the proper tests to make the association,&#8221; Kirsch says. &#8220;They could easily do that. But they won&#8217;t. That tells you everything you need to know about the corruption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So it will be an unexplained rise in unexplained deaths due to unknown causes because nobody in the mainstream media is ever going to admit they were wrong and ask a few unscripted questions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kirsch also believes that Donald Trump is too afraid to speak out against the jabs, which somehow explains why he <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-28-trump-deadly-vax-millions-operation-warp-speed.html\" target=\"_blank\">repeatedly promoted them</a> while calling himself &#8220;father of the vaccine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To learn more about the dangers and ineffectiveness of covid &#8220;vaccines&#8221; and other products from Pfizer, be sure to check out <a href=\"http://chemicalviolence.com\" target=\"_blank\">ChemicalViolence.com</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/do-you-know-how-many-people-have\" target=\"_blank\">SteveKirsch.substack.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-07-09-post-covid-vaccine-deaths-not-being-autopsied.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-40-times-americans-died-wwii-covid-vaccines.html\" data-a2a-title=\"VACCINE HOLOCAUST: More than 40 times the number of Americans who died in WWII are now dead from covid “vaccines”\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-40-times-americans-died-wwii-covid-vaccines.html&linkname=VACCINE%20HOLOCAUST%3A%20More%20than%2040%20times%20the%20number%20of%20Americans%20who%20died%20in%20WWII%20are%20now%20dead%20from%20covid%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-40-times-americans-died-wwii-covid-vaccines.html&linkname=VACCINE%20HOLOCAUST%3A%20More%20than%2040%20times%20the%20number%20of%20Americans%20who%20died%20in%20WWII%20are%20now%20dead%20from%20covid%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-40-times-americans-died-wwii-covid-vaccines.html&linkname=VACCINE%20HOLOCAUST%3A%20More%20than%2040%20times%20the%20number%20of%20Americans%20who%20died%20in%20WWII%20are%20now%20dead%20from%20covid%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-40-times-americans-died-wwii-covid-vaccines.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-17 11:58:40', '82', '', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '2032-08-14 22:50:20', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '4', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Last month, the country&#8217;s inflation rate was in excess of 250 percent.</p>\n<p>The Zimbabwe central bank announced that the coins have &#8220;liquid asset status,&#8221; which means they are &#8220;capable of being easily converted to cash and [are] tradable locally and internationally&#8230;[and] <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/26/zimbabwe-launches-gold-coins-to-stem-inflation\">may also be used for transactional purposes</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But the one-ounce coins, at current prices for the commodity, are worth around $1,800, which means for most Zimbabwe citizens they are unaffordable, given the average worker and civil servant there only earns around $2,600 annually, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62520693\">the <em>BBC</em> reports</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The once-ounce coins have been called, &#8220;Mosi-oa-Tunya,&#8221; or Tongan for Victoria Falls, which translates into &#8220;The Smoke Which Thunders.&#8221; Banks are selling the gold coins at the world price plus a 5 percent minting and distribution fee.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are now providing that store of value to ensure that people do not run to the parallel market in search for foreign currency to store value,&#8221; said Mangudya when the coins were first released.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And there is no other better product that can be used to store value other than gold. We know what you have been going through in terms of the fear factor of losing value and therefore we are providing this gold coin,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p><em>Zero Hedge</em> adds:</p>\n<p><em>Banks have sold 4,475 of the one-ounce coins so far, the state-affiliated Herald newspaper reports, with 90% having been purchased with local currency. Foreigners can only buy the coins with foreign money. </em></p>\n<p><em>The proprietor of a Harare clothing shop told The Herald that black-market exchange rates have leveled out since the introduction of the coins. </em></p>\n<p>&#8220;For the past one or so weeks, the rates are stable and if it continues like this, we will be able to accept local currency and invest the profits in gold coins,&#8221; Sharon Sangarwe noted.</p>\n<p>The country is also relaxing restrictions on black market currency and foreign exchange restrictions, from $500 a week to $5,000 per month, more than double.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Zimbabwe, the <a href=\"http://www.goldreport.news\">country is rich in gold deposits</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All gold mined in Zimbabwe is supposed to be sold to the central bank, but many producers prefer to smuggle it out of the country in order to get payment in US dollars,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/26/zimbabwe-launches-gold-coins-to-stem-inflation\">notes a report by <em>Al Jazeera</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted that he believes some U.S. states could turn to issuing their own gold coins soon, even though they are not permitted to print their own currencies, as a means of battling back against the Biden deep state&#8217;s attempts to crash the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>One state, Texas, <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/050802_Texas_gold_depository_Federal_Reserve.html\">already has substantial gold reserves</a> and has been building on them for years.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/050802_Texas_gold_depository_Federal_Reserve.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/zimbabwe-hails-success-gold-coin-issuance-lower-denominations-coming\">ZeroHedge.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-zimbabwes-roll-out-of-gold-coins-smashing-success.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Zimbabwe’s roll-out of gold coins is a smashing success as cratering dollar will lead other nations, U.S. states, to do the same thing\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-zimbabwes-roll-out-of-gold-coins-smashing-success.html&linkname=Zimbabwe%E2%80%99s%20roll-out%20of%20gold%20coins%20is%20a%20smashing%20success%20as%20cratering%20dollar%20will%20lead%20other%20nations%2C%20U.S.%20states%2C%20to%20do%20the%20same%20thing\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-zimbabwes-roll-out-of-gold-coins-smashing-success.html&linkname=Zimbabwe%E2%80%99s%20roll-out%20of%20gold%20coins%20is%20a%20smashing%20success%20as%20cratering%20dollar%20will%20lead%20other%20nations%2C%20U.S.%20states%2C%20to%20do%20the%20same%20thing\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-zimbabwes-roll-out-of-gold-coins-smashing-success.html&linkname=Zimbabwe%E2%80%99s%20roll-out%20of%20gold%20coins%20is%20a%20smashing%20success%20as%20cratering%20dollar%20will%20lead%20other%20nations%2C%20U.S.%20states%2C%20to%20do%20the%20same%20thing\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-zimbabwes-roll-out-of-gold-coins-smashing-success.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-17 11:57:30', '82', '', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '2032-08-14 22:50:20', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '3', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

She says the hospital system where she used to work never would have tolerated any of what she does now.

I was stressed in a way I&#8217;ve never been before in my entire life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the worst things in Kay&#8217;s view was having to turn away family members, even when a patient was on his or her death bed and would only be able to see them one last time before passing.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Kay, she found an inpatient protocol designed by Dr. Paul Marik, a founding member of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance. That protocol is said to have about a 94 percent success rate – a success rate <i>far</i> higher than anything Kay&#8217;s hospital was doing.</p>\n<p>Kay tried to pitch the protocol to the pulmonary critical care department, only to be scoffed at and have the idea dismissed.

Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which has been simulating the scenarios, <a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/defense-experts-game-out-us-china-war-over-taiwan-dalio-warns-escalations-very\">said earlier this week</a>. &#8220;However, the cost will be very high to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy and to US forces in the Pacific.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/what-if-war-game-for-a-us-china-conflict-sees-a-heavy-toll?sref=ZMFHsM5Z\">Bloomberg News added</a>:</p>\n<p><em>In sessions that will run through September, retired US generals and Navy officers and former Pentagon officials hunch like chess players over tabletops along with analysts from the CSIS think tank. They move forces depicted as blue and red boxes and small wooden squares over maps of the Western Pacific and Taiwan. The results will be released to the public in December.</em></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Those results are not likely to include details like how the U.S. and Taiwan would respond, precisely; what weapons will be needed to thwart a Chinese invasion; or how the Biden regime plans to respond diplomatically &#8212; all meant to keep China guessing.</p>\n<p>But the report is likely to be impactful given that the U.S. public will need to be on board for the defense of Taiwan, which is something that absolutely should happen given Taiwan&#8217;s incredible value to U.S. national security and our economy: Taiwan is the No. 1 producer of sophisticated computer chips and that is a capacity that China cannot be allowed to obtain.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The base assumption is that China invades Taiwan to force unification, which the US responds to with its military. Another assumption (that&#8217;s &#8216;far from certain&#8217;) is that Japan would grant &#8216;expanded rights&#8217; to use US bases on its territory &#8212; but wouldn&#8217;t intervene directly unless Japanese land is attacked,&#8221; <em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/defense-experts-game-out-us-china-war-over-taiwan-dalio-warns-escalations-very\">Zero Hedge </a></em><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/defense-experts-game-out-us-china-war-over-taiwan-dalio-warns-escalations-very\">reported</a>, citing the wargaming scenarios.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that nuclear weapons are <em>not</em> part of the current wargaming scenarios, but rather on existing weapons and capabilities in the region. But again, if nukes were factored in, it won&#8217;t be mentioned in the public report due out in September.</p>\n<p>News of the wargames comes as companies make plans to leave Taiwan ahead of an emergency and the country conducts its own major military exercises.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://forwardobserver.com/early-warning-inflation-reduction-act-to-increase-taxes-raise-costs/\">private intelligence firm Forward Observer</a>:</p>\n<p><em>Multinational businesses operating in Taiwan are putting plans in place to evacuate personnel and assets should China attack the island nation. Although there are no reports of businesses leaving the island yet, the unprecedented Chinese military exercises in the waters surrounding Taiwan, as well as Taiwan’s own defensive military drills, have led corporate leaders to prepare for such an eventuality. The war preparations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait prompted Taipei’s National Palace Museum to initiate “wartime response measures” several weeks ago. The precautions include security measures for staff as well as ones to safeguard and evacuate the museum’s treasures. </em></p>\n<p>&#8220;According to several security consulting firms, a number of multinational business leaders were caught flat-footed by the <a href=\"http://www.wwiii.news\">rising tensions between Taiwan and China</a>,&#8221; said an accompanying analyst comment.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those who do not want to be on the island during a Chinese takeover will need to lead-turn their departure based on daily reports of Chinese military preparations. Once an air and sea blockade is put into effect, it is unlikely commercial transportation, even for foreigners, will be available,&#8221; the analyst added.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forwardobserver.com/early-warning-inflation-reduction-act-to-increase-taxes-raise-costs/\">ForwardObserver.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/what-if-war-game-for-a-us-china-conflict-sees-a-heavy-toll?sref=ZMFHsM5Z\">Bloomberg.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-u-s-defense-experts-map-out-potential-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan.html\" data-a2a-title=\"U.S. defense experts ‘map out’ potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, reveal ‘high cost’ of defending island\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-u-s-defense-experts-map-out-potential-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan.html&linkname=U.S.%20defense%20experts%20%E2%80%98map%20out%E2%80%99%20potential%20Chinese%20invasion%20of%20Taiwan%2C%20reveal%20%E2%80%98high%20cost%E2%80%99%20of%20defending%20island\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-u-s-defense-experts-map-out-potential-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan.html&linkname=U.S.%20defense%20experts%20%E2%80%98map%20out%E2%80%99%20potential%20Chinese%20invasion%20of%20Taiwan%2C%20reveal%20%E2%80%98high%20cost%E2%80%99%20of%20defending%20island\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-u-s-defense-experts-map-out-potential-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan.html&linkname=U.S.%20defense%20experts%20%E2%80%98map%20out%E2%80%99%20potential%20Chinese%20invasion%20of%20Taiwan%2C%20reveal%20%E2%80%98high%20cost%E2%80%99%20of%20defending%20island\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-17-u-s-defense-experts-map-out-potential-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '88', '2022-08-17 11:52:07', '82', '', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-17 22:50:16', '2032-08-14 22:50:20', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '1', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

The American Medical Association was the catapult for', 'corruption for everything pharma in America. After World War II, Hitler&#8217;s pharma complex scientists were released from prison and catapulted America&#8217;s development of chronic sick-care pharmaceuticals, deadly chemotherapy and genocidal vaccinations.</p>\n<p>The FDA and CDC were &#8220;all in&#8221; with the code words and phrases for their depopulation schemes. Fluoride in water was &#8220;good for your teeth,&#8221; even though it causes cancer, brittle bones and calcification of the pineal gland. All vaccines were deemed &#8220;safe and effective&#8221; at all times, and that&#8217;s still the mantra today, even though they spread disease, cause autism, induce spontaneous abortion and now clog the entire vascular system with sticky, toxic spike protein prions.</p>\n<h3><strong>Humans attacked by Big Pharma and Big Food on all fronts that cause sickness, death, abortions, infertility</strong></h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to fool the masses. It takes a coordinated effort of fake research, misinformation and propaganda spread through multi-media, and enough doctors, scientists and hospital administrators on board to run the &#8220;show.&#8221; Then, Big Agriculture does its damage on the front end, spraying most crops that are grown in toxic fertilizer with chemical insecticides and pesticides that drive human health to the brink.</p>\n<p>Food is then processed to the extent that it no longer carries much, if any, nutritional value. That&#8217;s called &#8220;junk food&#8221; and &#8220;food stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>There are hormones and antibiotics you should never be eating in most meat and dairy. There are hormone disruptors in all kinds of food packaging, including plastic bottles and casings that leech chemicals into the food, beverages and water. That&#8217;s not all. Abortions are promoted heavily by the government, especially for minorities, as Planned Parenthood (Childless planning) Centers are located in every bustling metropolitan city of America, where the minorities dominate the populace. Not a coincidence. This is population reductionism at its peak.</p>\n<h3><strong>Top 6 population reduction schemes well-thought-out by Big Pharma and Big Food, then perpetuated by the Social Media Tech Giants</strong></h3>\n<p>#1.

Chemotherapy (literally <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/027028_cancer_WHO_natural.html\">spreads the cancer</a>)</p>\n<p>#3. Planned Parenthood (founded by Margaret Sanger, a <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-04-23-planned-parenthood-disavows-margaret-sanger.html\">racist, white-supremacist and eugenicist</a>)</p>\n<p>#4. Fluoridated water</p>\n<p>#5. Hormone disruptors (in food plastics and packaging) for causing infertility</p>\n<p>#6. Infertility resulting from transgender mutilations of children under the &#8220;LGBT&#8221; flag</p>\n<h3><strong>Today&#8217;s social media is a social sickness of pandemic proportions</strong></h3>\n<p>Today&#8217;s social media is a social sickness. It&#8217;s a pandemic of distorted thoughts and misinformation that turn into actions that can kill you, your children, and their children. From the millenials onward, every facet of social media is designed to warp, twist and deconstruct all thinking when it comes to physical and mental health, safety, ethics, morals and family values. Trends are fake. Friends are fake. Followers are fake.</p>\n<p>Now, young kids, teens and young adults are into <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2018-01-29-gender-fluid-indoctrination-of-schoolchildren-is-child-abuse-warns-doctor.html\">genitalia mutilation</a> to try to &#8220;fit in&#8221; with what they think is a normal way of identifying their gender and relationships, which seem to be filled with thoughts of sex and perversion all day, thanks to this &#8220;gender fluid&#8221; movement splattered all over social media.</p>\n<p>Often times, when people, of all ages, get <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2018-11-30-lgbt-advocates-now-routinely-subjecting-children-to-sexual-abuse-and-gender-fluid-brainwashing.html\">sex change operations</a> and take hormone pills, it changes them permanently in ways they regret, including infertility, and horrific problems urinating.

God Wins.</strong>\n\n\n<strong>Iraq has put out a new rate for their Dinar</strong>, and has began paying Contractors using the new rate.\n\n<strong>No one knows the date of notification</strong> to make exchange appointments, but Bruce was guessing it would start on <strong>Wed. 17 Aug.</strong>\n\n\n<strong>MAJOR news</strong> was about to hit from Middle and South America that would affect the U.S.\n\n<strong>The Bankers will ensure we stay in Debt.</strong> The Pharmaceutical Companies will ensure we stay Sick. The Weapons manufacturers will ensure we keep going to War. The Media will ensure we are kept from knowing the Truth. And the Government will ensure all of this is done Legally. …Eyal Snck\n\n<strong>Because of the pending crises</strong> it was strongly advised to store at least 2-3 weeks of food, water and essential supplies, plus cash in case of bank ATM failure.\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Global Currency Reset:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Tues. 16 Aug. Coach Jerry:</strong> &#8220;Be encouraged dear community, our time will come. If we could figure out the precise timing, then the evil opposition could also figure it out. And I have a sneaking suspicion that the Worldwide Alliance has designed this entire &#8220;movie&#8221; such that no one, outside the good military, is quite able to figure it out.&#8221;<strong></strong>\n\n\n<strong>Tues.</strong><strong> 16 Aug. Bruce: </strong>Tier 4B (us, the Internet Group) had a possibility of notification to set exchange appointments on <strong>Wed. 17 Aug.</strong> <strong>late morning or early afternoon</strong> and start exchanges on <strong>Thurs. 18 Aug.</strong> Redemption Centers will be fully staffed for eleven days.”\n\n<strong>Tues. 16 Aug. MarkZ: </strong>“Out of Iraq – they are preparing for the release within the next few days, not weeks. There was a lot of confusing information coming out about the date. They don’t want us to know the timing because otherwise the Cabal would drop large amounts of money into it and then make money off it. I am getting chatter to get my paperwork updated immediately.”\n\n<strong>Mon. 15 Aug. MarkZ:</strong> “Whales, Bond Holders and Tier 3 Group exchangers were in place, positioning for GCR Liquidity, with the release expected at any second. I don’t think they are kicking the can. There were a lot of behind the scenes things moving today. I did have some conversations with Iraqi contacts today. I am still hearing the rate is agreed to and the timing is agreed to with the CBI. I’m feeling confident guys even though we don’t know the exact timing. Contractors are pretty excited. My three contacts won’t share what the rate is but just said they were very successful getting the new contracts and rates renegotiated. I wish I could say more but I am walking on the razor with this one.”\n\n<strong>We will have about 10 days</strong> to exchange or redeem our currencies and bonds (Zim) for the special rates. …White Hat Intel\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tues. 16 Aug. 2022 The Big Call, Bruce:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thebigcall.net/\">Thebigcall.net</a> 667-770-1866 pin123456#</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Iraq has put out a new rate for their Dinar</strong> and Contractors were being paid at that new rate as of <strong>Mon. 15 Aug.</strong>\n\n\n<strong>Those who were Introducers to Bond Sellers</strong> were believed to have received their emails and could see what was in their accounts. It was believed they had access to those accounts as of today Tues. 16 Aug.\n\n<strong>Bond Sellers</strong> were still waiting to be notified.\n\n<strong>Bond Sellers will get 1% access</strong> to monies in their accounts for 30 days, and then get 10% access of the total each month for the next 9 months.\n\n<strong>At your exchange if you have currency but no Zim</strong> you will have full digital access to your funds in USN or USTN.\n\n<strong>At your appointment if you redeemed Zim</strong> you will have immediate access to 1% of the funds, and then in 30 days have access to another 10% of the total, then another 30 days have another 10% access. That will go on for the next 9 months.\n\n<strong>Today Tues. 16 Aug. Redemption Centers</strong> were in conference calls and banks in meetings.\n\n<strong>Tier 4B (us, the Internet Group)</strong> could be notified to set our exchange appointments <strong>Wed. 17 Aug.</strong> <strong>late morning or early afternoon</strong> and start our exchanges on <strong>Thurs. 18 Aug.</strong>\n\n\n<strong>Notification </strong>will be at the same in each Time Zone.\n\n<strong>There will be Redemption Center</strong> full staffing for 11 days straight.\n\n<strong>Tier 1 banks were reducing their branches</strong> because there will not be enough need for those branches in the future.\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Judy Note:</strong> The below link shows an interview with Juan O Savin where he (twice) states that GESARA/NESARA, the Global Currency Reset and the Zim Bonds were all a scam. (9 min. and 17 min. mark). We have been told that the next few months will be filled with misinformation and chaos. This certainly qualifies for that. When I asked Charlie Ward about this he said, “My feeling is that there was a lot of misinformation being spread out there that was done so as to be a distraction.”<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2022/08/juan-o-savin-ethan-lucas-nesaragesara-crypto-are-all-their-scams-video-3778230.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2022/08/juan-o-savin-ethan-lucas-nesaragesara-crypto-are-all-their-scams-video-3778230.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>White Hat Intel:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<strong>Over 400 sites across U.S. are planned for Liberal protests</strong> against SCOTUS possible turn over after Justice Robert confirms the Leaks.These 400 planned protests will turn into riot&#8217;s as being planned by Deep State, Antifa and Left Wing extremist.\n\n<strong>National Guard is expected to be deployed</strong> in all U.S. States.\n\n<strong>When clashes become too heavy,</strong> dangerous and violent, it was HIGHLY expected that Army divisions Light Infantry units WILL be deployed.\n\n<strong>Training for Army units began</strong> in secure locations through North American regions on how to combat inner city Civil disturbance operations.\n\n<strong>The UN</strong> is also currently holding Military drills on combating Civil Unrest in large cities and Gray Zones.\n\n<strong>It had been EXPECTED</strong> by Q drops that the DEEP STATE would turn to violent protest across the U.S. and in this moment Military divisions would be deployed under crowd control.\n\n<strong>Chief Justice Roberts SCOTUS was a TURN COAT</strong> (playing a part and placed by WHITE HATS. His crimes were massive and connected wars through FISA courts and Treason. His wealth is was heavily connected to human trafficking money laundering in Ukraine, Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia (old Clinton world Saudis ties that were now ending).\n\n<strong>Behind the scenes</strong> White operations were targeting the Senate captured foreign operations. The Senate was headed into exposure, collusion and collapse.\n\n<strong>Down South the Cartels were</strong> in a DEEP War inside KILLING FIELDS and taking sides along White Hat or Black Hats operations.\n\n<strong>A huge cleaning is underway through the Cartel world</strong>. Cartels run Middle American/ South America. You can&#8217;t fix the U.S and world DEEP STATE if you don&#8217;t take down CARTELS that run countries and that work for the DEEP STATE CABAL.

Right now all across America, government agencies are buying up a long list of survival and preparedness gear, depleting the supply that remains available to civilians. Large-scale government purchases currently include: Storable food, MREs and emergency food supplies. Ammunition and firearms. Night vision devices. High-efficiency HVAC system components. Potassium iodide pills (for protecting the thyroid from radiation damage). Garden seeds and fertilizer. Diesel fuel, diesel engine oil and other transportation-related components. These supplies are being transported by the millions of pallets into underground caves, bunkers and even cities that are run by governments of the world.

Founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela), it has, since 1965, been headquartered in Vienna, Austria, although Austria is not an OPEC member state. As of September 2018, the 13 member countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 81.5 percent of the world&#8217;s &#8220;proven&#8221; oil reserves, giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices.\n\n<strong>White Hat Military were gathering all data</strong> on OPEC and doing surveillance in Freeport Texas and along the coast of Gulf of Mexico, where the U.S. was keeping large portions of oil reserves.\n\n<strong>Biden</strong> has sold over 5 million barrels to Europe and Asia so far on the record. Off record the Deep State Regime has sold over 25 million so far. Why would Biden be selling oil illegally abroad in a time of Oil gas crisis in the U.S.? And why is the military watching?
