More than 180 members filed <a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/ProxyLetter#ActiveProxies\">proxy letters</a> with the House clerk, according to the clerk&rsquo;s website, allowing them to vote remotely. <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/11/house-freedom-caucus-oppose-climate-package-reconciliation/\"><strong>(RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Freedom Caucus Calls On Republicans To Oppose Climate Package &lsquo;Through All Available Means&rsquo;)</strong></a></p> <p>The legislation includes nearly $370 billion in green energy subsidies and tax credits,', 'a prescription drug price fixing scheme, an increase in the corporate tax rate, and nearly $80 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Despite the bill&rsquo;s name, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to have no <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/29/inflation-reduction-schumer-manchin-wharton/\">impact</a> on inflation.</p> <p>&ldquo;I think America needs a plan that actually works,&rdquo; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a floor speech urging his colleagues to vote against the bill. &ldquo;Why, if you passed an American Rescue Plan that caused inflation that we haven&rsquo;t seen in 41 years?

The Republican leader <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/11/19/mccarthy-marathon-floor-speech-prevents-democrats-budget-passing/\">used</a> the rule in November 2021 to speak for more than eight-and-a-half hours, setting a chamber record. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer used the rule to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CraigCaplan/status/1558189305423593473\">speak</a> for more than 20 minutes.</p> <p>The vote concludes a process that began almost immediately after Congress passed the American Rescue Plan in March 2021. Left-wing members, including Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, called for a $6 trillion package focused on green energy, healthcare, and child care. Sanders and the majority of Democrats coalesced around a $3.5 trillion package, but West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/10/21/manchin-reconciliation-avoid-spending/\">refused</a> to support a bill of that size.</p> <p>Manchin publicly feuded with the White House in December 2021 and January 2022, leading many Democrats to believe that a reconciliation package had no chance of passing. He repeatedly argued that an influx of federal spending would exacerbate inflation, which reached <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/10/biden-falsely-claims-inflation-disappeared-in-july/\">8.5%</a> year-over-year at the end of July. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema had also declined to commit to supporting a large spending bill.</p> <p>Manchin and Schumer renewed secret negotiations in July, <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/07/27/joe-manchin-will-support-reconciliation-package/\">announcing</a> the Inflation Reduction Act shortly after the Senate passed the Chips And Science Act, while Sinema also <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/05/kyrsten-sinema-democrats-carried-interest-inflation-reduction-act-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">struck a deal</a> with Senate Democrats. The Senate <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/07/senate-democrats-pass-740-billion-climate-healthcare-reconciliation-package-inflation-reduction-act/\">passed</a> the legislation in a 51-50

Most still refuse to think deeply about what drove such massive popularity for Trump. Some of it was his focus on issues, such as extended wars in the Middle East and a lack of border security, where there was a growing chasm between voters&rsquo; desires and politicians&rsquo; priorities. The biggest part, though, was a growing mistrust felt by many Americans for their political leaders altogether. There are still so many open questions about the', 'FBI&rsquo;s raid on Trump&rsquo;s Mar-a-Lago home this week, but one thing for sure is it reinforced the feeling many Americans have that the system is rigged. The Biden Justice Department, in other words, just reinforced the sentiment that brought Trump to power in the first place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this, like so many of America&rsquo;s recent problems, could have been avoided. How about an explanation? Did Attorney General Merrick Garland even consider the damage he would do by raiding a popular ex-president&rsquo;s home with no explanation whatsoever? It&rsquo;s as if those running America are trying to drive a huge swath of voters away from any trust in the system.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raiding an ex-president&rsquo;s home is a truly historic act. It&rsquo;s unprecedented. Anyone planning such an act had to know the firestorm that would follow. To choose to do so without at least justifying the need in some detail is to purposely enrage a huge number of already disaffected voters. Where does this all end? The constant escalation is putting America on course for disaster.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the DOJ had a strong reason to raid Trump&rsquo;s home, then they had an obligation to state it. Not doing so fits a strong pattern of federal law enforcement entering the political arena and causing major damage. To be fair, Democrats drove this most recent abuse, but both sides have been doing their best to criminalize political disputes for decades now. Innocent people are harmed each time. Regular people&rsquo;s desire to serve and to trust those in power has been diminished each time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing exemplifies this better than the pretext the DOJ has given without any real explanation. The search and seizure was about classified documents removed from the White House, they say. Trump already had the authority to declassify documents when he was president. If he really removed classified material without declassifying them, then he shouldn&rsquo;t have. But even in that case, it would not be enough to justify a full-fledged FBI raid on the home of a former president and the top potential political rival of the current president. Republicans are certainly being hypocritical after the &ldquo;lock her up&rdquo; chants directed to Hillary Clinton for alleged violations of handling classified materials, but that also does not justify an FBI raid of this unprecedented nature. Democrats who defended Clinton when she had classified information in her home are no less hypocritical for now arguing that a classified records violation justifies a mafia-style FBI raid.</span></p>\n<div id=\"outbrainPlaceholder\"></div> <div class=\"readmore\"></div> <div id=\"rev-more-content\"> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is nothing more to the DOJ&rsquo;s case than a classified records violation, this will go down as a historic blunder so big it could set an already teetering country on edge. It begs the question, are there any adults in charge? Ironically, Garland was supposed to be that adult. Remember when the media tried to sell the now attorney general and then-Supreme Court nominee to the American people as a sensible nonpartisan moderate? Republicans should let him on the court, they argued, because you can&rsquo;t find someone more moderate. He&rsquo;s just a technocrat, they said. He&rsquo;s apolitical, they promised. After threatening parents with prosecution for standing up for their own children and reportedly stifling a real investigation into Hunter Biden, the media&rsquo;s Garland talking points were already shattering. This blunder dwarfs those. If there was more to justify this raid, why not explain it? Why voluntarily enrage so many Americans if you have a better reason to give them?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without explanation, Americans are likely to fill in the blanks on their own, and they won&rsquo;t be forgiving. There&rsquo;s been a lot of concern about anti-government extremism lately, and I can think of few things that would fuel it more than a raid on Trump&rsquo;s home without transparency. If Biden was kept in the dark, as his communications team has repeatedly insisted, he needs to get to the bottom of this historic move and rapidly bring the details to the American people.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a bipartisan China trade policy that many Americans blame for hollowing out their communities, to a tax system too many feel is rigged only in favor of the new and booming billionaire class, to an open border, to an opioid epidemic that nobody in leading national office of either party cared about until it was too late, too many Americans have been driven to lose trust in those in power. Unless someone releases a super compelling explanation that, for some reason, was withheld for days, this latest FBI raid will drive many more Americans to lose all trust. America&rsquo;s leaders clearly don&rsquo;t think that matters. Nothing matters more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neil Patel co-founded The Daily Caller, one of America&rsquo;s fastest-growing online news outlets, which regularly breaks news and distributes it to over 15 million monthly readers.

The district&rsquo;s Equal Educational Opportunity Title IX Compliance Office concluded its investigation into the incident on Thursday, stating the photos were removed because the text accompanying them were &ldquo;too complex&rdquo; for James&rsquo; students.</p> <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to clear up some inaccuracies in the claims made by our former employee, Mr. Michael James,&rdquo; the district said in a statement obtained by the DCNF.</p> <p>A &ldquo;board certified behavior analyst&rdquo; and a &ldquo;behavior coach&rdquo; assisted James with setting up his classroom for a group of four to six Autism Spectrum Disorder students on Aug. 8, the district statement provided to the DCNF said.

They are often more academically advanced than non-ESE students. Yes, some in my class would be able to read the statements under the pictures and at the very least be taught to read. That is what teachers do.&rdquo;</p> <p>In 2020, while running for mayor in Sylacauga, Alabama, James was criticized for posting on Facebook calling for drug dealers to be publicly hanged, Alabama.com <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2020/05/mayoral-candidate-in-rural-alabama-campaigns-on-public-hangings-for-drug-dealers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported.</a></p> <p>&ldquo;I think that was taken out of context,&rdquo; James told the DCNF. &ldquo;They tried to make it come off like some kind of racial thing that I said. I was talking about drug traffickers, not drug users. There&rsquo;s more far more white drug traffickers than there are black drug traffickers. But, you know, that&rsquo;s just the way that story went that time.&rdquo;</p> <p>Escambia County Superintendent Tim Smith did not immediately respond to the DCNF&rsquo;s request for comment.</p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\">Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

However, Norwegian authorities say the 1,300-pound animal is at risk of <a', 'href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/22/alligator-euthanized-florida-fence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">being euthanized </a>because she may inadvertently endanger onlookers who ignore warnings not to get too close, according to Insider.</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Big story in Norway this summer is a walrus we&rsquo;ve named Freya has made it to our shores and is touring the country, laying around and sinking boats <a href=\"https://t.co/rQolsxd88b\">pic.twitter.com/rQolsxd88b</a></p> <p>&mdash; Wild Geerters (@steinkobbe) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steinkobbe/status/1549470090030202885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 19, 2022</a></p>\n</blockquote> <p></p> <p>Freya&rsquo;s love for sunbathing started attracting a lot of attention in July, after she climbed into leisure boats docked near Oslo to catch a few rays, according to Insider. Completely unaware of her weight, the friendly walrus nearly sank the vessels, giving onlookers a good performance that kept them coming back for more.</p> <p>People flocked to the area to watch her <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2014/05/05/walrus-slaps-woman-on-the-butt-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">put on a show</a> as she belly flopped onto the boats and chased ducks around. Sadly, Freya&rsquo;s cute demeanor is leading visitors to become increasingly careless. As adorable as she is, Freya may attack people if she feels threatened. Furthermore, according to a veterinarian, she is showing signs of stress and lack of sleep, which can make her behave more aggressively, Insider reported.</p>\n<div id=\"outbrainPlaceholder\"></div> <div class=\"readmore\"></div> <div id=\"rev-more-content\"> <p>Norway&rsquo;s Directorate of Fisheries issued an urgent warning Thursday, stating they have observed &ldquo;negligent behavior&rdquo; by guests who are defying advice to keep their distance from the animal, according to Insider.</p> <p>Nadia Jdaini, the directorate&rsquo;s senior communications advisor, issued a strict warning regarding the situation. &ldquo;We are now probing further measures, where euthanasia can be a real alternative,&rdquo; she said, according to the outlet. <strong><a title=\"28-Year-Old Japanese Jockey Taiki Yanagida Trampled To Death In New Zealand\" href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/09/horse-jockey-trampled-death-taiki-yanagida-new-zealand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(RELATED: 28-Year-Old Japanese Jockey Taiki Yanagida Trampled To Death In New Zealand)</a></strong></p> <p></p> <p>Walruses are not typically aggressive toward humans, but Freya has been overwhelmed recently. &ldquo;Our biggest fear is that people could get hurt,&rdquo; Jdaini said. Children have come very close to her and some visitors have tried to sunbathe with her, despite posted warning signs advocating against this behavior, according to Insider.</p>\n<div id=\"piano-newsletter\" class=\"piano-newsletter\"> </div> <p>Jdaini is currently working with local police to maintain a safe distance between Freya and her fan club.</p> <p>Those getting too close to Freya may become the reason she is put down, so hopefully her adoring fans will consider her wellbeing as well as their own, and adjust their behavior accordingly.</p> </div>\n</div>\n<div

Number two, they didn&rsquo;t need to &lsquo;seize&rsquo; anything,&rdquo; Trump said in the statement. &ldquo;They could have had it anytime they wanted without playing politics and breaking into Mar-a-Lago. It was in secured storage, with an additional lock put on as per their request. They could have had it anytime they wanted &mdash; and that includes LONG ago. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK.

Suddenly, the CDC has essentially admitted <strong>it was all theater from the very start</strong> and was never backed by actual &#8220;science&#8221; in the first place.</p>\n<p>You can catch my full commentary on both of these breaking stories in the Situation Update podcast shown here, with additional editorial explanations found below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://Brighteon.com/189b2b22-ea87-4fd2-90e9-4088198d93af\" target=\"_blank\">Brighteon.com/189b2b22-ea87-4fd2-90e9-4088198d93af</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Governments are preparing for an Extinction Level Event (ELE)</h2>\n<p>Right now all across America, government agencies are buying up a long list of <a href=\"http://gear.news\">survival and preparedness gear</a>, depleting the supply that remains available to civilians. Large-scale government purchases currently include:</p>\n\nStorable food, MREs and emergency food supplies.\nAmmunition and firearms.\nNight vision devices.\nHigh-efficiency HVAC system components.\nPotassium iodide pills (for protecting the thyroid from radiation damage).\nGarden seeds and fertilizer.\nDiesel fuel, diesel engine oil and other transportation-related components.\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a></p>\n<p>These supplies are being transported by the millions of pallets into underground caves, bunkers and even <em>cities</em> that are run by governments of the world. For example, it&#8217;s no longer a secret that even <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/extremely-rare-photos-inside-taiwans-underground-fighter-jet-caves\">the nation of Taiwan runs a massive underground air force base</a>, complete with its own aircraft hangars built inside caves, along with aircraft taxi ways and transport lanes, all underground. From TheDrive.com:</p>\n<p><em>The Taiwanese Air Force, also known as the Republic of China Air Force, or ROCAF, has uncharacteristically released photos of weapons loading operations that were carried out in the highly-fortified underground cave-like complex connected to Chiashan Air Force Base. The photos offer a very rare look inside the subterranean tunnel network that houses some of the ROCAF’s most capable fighter jets&#8230;</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/Taiwan-Underground-Fighter-Jet-Cave-550.jpg\" title=\"\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s information based on what&#8217;s being publicly released. What actually exists that&#8217;s <em>classified</em> is far more extensive. In the United States, the US government has constructed massive underground cities and bunkers with tunnels connecting them across thousands of miles of underground transport tunnels, some of which are of course used for human trafficking.</p>\n<p>The point here is that <strong>the US government is preparing for the end of the world while telling civilians everything&#8217;s fine</strong>. The people will never be told to prepare for anything. The people are being fed to the wolves and left to die while the government is tripling down on its own COG (Continuity Of Government) emergency plans and trying to provoke World War III with both China and Russia, all while the domestic regime wages a war of tyranny and violence against the American people via the FBI, IRS, DOJ, ATF, EPA, etc.</p>\n<h2>The CDC reverses itself, admitting the entire &#8220;covid theater&#8221; charade was a giant lie</h2>\n<p>Also covered today is the astonishing reversal of covid guidance by the CDC, which has spent the last 2.5 years spreading quack science lies and propaganda to the world, resulting in the needless deaths of millions of people worldwide.</p>\n<p>Suddenly now, the CDC says their previous guidelines don&#8217;t apply any longer. They&#8217;ve dropped their demands on masks, vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people, social distancing, mandatory quarantines, keeping exposed children out of school and even about running covid tests on asymptomatic people (i.e. testing those who aren&#8217;t even sick).</p>\n<p>This is a shocking, wholesale reversal of most of the lies the CDC been pushing for years, and it begs the question: Will all the employees who were fired for questioning the CDC&#8217;s previous &#8220;guidance&#8221; now get their jobs back? Will they get back pay?</p>\n<p>Will Big Tech reverse all the censorship and deplatforming of people who questioned the CDC&#8217;s lies?</p>\n<p>Will there be any apology from the complicit media outlets that peddled the CDC&#8217;s propaganda for the last 2+ years?</p>\n<p>And what will be done to compensate all the children and families for the pain and suffering of unnecessary lockdowns, mandatory mask policies, the cruel isolation of children, the mask policies on airlines and all the other examples of medical insanity that ruled America since early 2020? Isn&#8217;t there some sort of <strong>national apology </strong>that we are owed?</p>\n<p>What about all the small businesses that were destroyed? The lives destroyed? The marriages that were obliterated? The hospital homicides committed in the name of CDC compliance?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to criminally indict all the top leaders of the CDC, FDA, NIH, NIAID and everybody else involved in this massive global scam that has destroyed millions of lives while generating tens of billions of dollars in profits for the corrupt pharmaceutical giants.</p>\n<p>This CDC reversal only admits that we were right all along. The entire covid theatrical production was a quack science scheme from day one, and the people who refused to obey the CDC&#8217;s absurd &#8220;guidance&#8221; are now completely vindicated.</p>\n<p>Learn more in today&#8217;s Situation Update podcast (above).</p>\n<h2>Where to learn more and stay informed</h2>\n<p>Discover more information-packaged podcasts, raw intel reports and interviews each day:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.brighteon.com/channels/HRreport</a></p>\n<p>Follow me on:</p>\n<p>Brighteon.social: <a href=\"http://Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger\" target=\"_blank\">Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger</a> (my breaking news gets posted here first)</p>\n<p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/RealHealthRanger\">t.me/RealHealthRanger</a> (breaking news is posted here second)</p>\n<p>Truth Social: <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@healthranger\" target=\"_blank\">https://truthsocial.com/@healthranger</a></p>\n<p>Gettr: <a href=\"http://GETTR.com/user/healthranger\" target=\"_blank\">GETTR.com/user/healthranger</a></p>\n<p>Parler: <a href=\"http://Parler.com/user/HealthRanger\" target=\"_blank\">Parler.com/user/HealthRanger</a></p>\n<p>Rumble: <a href=\"http://Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport\" target=\"_blank\">Rumble.com/c/HealthRangerReport</a></p>\n<p>BitChute: <a href=\"http://Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitchute.com/channel/9EB8glubb0Ns/</a></p>\n<p>Clouthub: <a href=\"http://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts\" target=\"_blank\">app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/naturalnews/posts</a></p>\n<p>Join the free <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/readerregistration.html\">NaturalNews.com email newsletter</a> to stay alerted about breaking news each day.</p>\n<p>Download my current audio books &#8212; including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind &#8212; at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://audiobooks.naturalnews.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://Audiobooks.NaturalNews.com/</a></p>\n<p>Download my new audio book, &#8220;Resilient Prepping&#8221; at <a href=\"http://ResilientPrepping.com\" target=\"_blank\">ResilientPrepping.com</a> &#8211; it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-world-governments-are-preparing-for-an-extinction-level-event-ele-cdc-reverses-itself.html\" data-a2a-title=\"World governments are preparing for an Extinction Level Event (ELE); CDC reverses itself on every pillar of COVID theater\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-world-governments-are-preparing-for-an-extinction-level-event-ele-cdc-reverses-itself.html&linkname=World%20governments%20are%20preparing%20for%20an%20Extinction%20Level%20Event%20%28ELE%29%3B%20CDC%20reverses%20itself%20on%20every%20pillar%20of%20COVID%20theater\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-world-governments-are-preparing-for-an-extinction-level-event-ele-cdc-reverses-itself.html&linkname=World%20governments%20are%20preparing%20for%20an%20Extinction%20Level%20Event%20%28ELE%29%3B%20CDC%20reverses%20itself%20on%20every%20pillar%20of%20COVID%20theater\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-world-governments-are-preparing-for-an-extinction-level-event-ele-cdc-reverses-itself.html&linkname=World%20governments%20are%20preparing%20for%20an%20Extinction%20Level%20Event%20%28ELE%29%3B%20CDC%20reverses%20itself%20on%20every%20pillar%20of%20COVID%20theater\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-world-governments-are-preparing-for-an-extinction-level-event-ele-cdc-reverses-itself.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '107', '2022-08-12 22:18:00', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:04:22', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '210', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

It', 'passed on a party-line vote; Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie.</p>\n<p>The House is poised to pass the bill at the end of the week. Unfortunately, the price controls it includes could significantly impact the benefits that many seniors have become accustomed to receiving.</p>\n<p>The Act would see an overhaul of Medicare Part D. The federal program, which is administrated via private insurance companies, gives Medicare beneficiaries retail prescription drug coverage; tens of thousands of people on Medicare did not have much help with drug costs prior to Medicare Part D.</p>\n<p>Around 64 million individuals were enrolled in Medicare during the most recent coverage year, while nearly <a href=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/06/how-medicare-prescription-drug-coverage-would-change-under-u-s-senate-democrats-bill/\">49 million</a> were enrolled in some type of prescription drug plan.</p>\n<p>Although the Democrats claim that their goal was reducing the prices of prescription drugs, price controls were quietly slipped into the section of the Inflation Reduction Act pertaining to Medicare Part D. The legislation alters Medicare Part D in several ways, and while some of these may sound positive on the surface, many experts have expressed concerns that the redesign will result in a reduction in the supplemental benefits of Medicare Part D recipients, who are largely senior citizens.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The price negotiation provision is being viewed by some as a form of government price setting that could have serious ramifications, such as discouraging investment in the research and development of new and breakthrough drugs that could save countless lives.</p>\n<h2>Many are skeptical of act&#8217;s benefits</h2>\n<p>Commentary published by The Heritage Foundation entitled <em>“Inflation Reduction Act” Is Euphemism for Big Government Socialism, Higher Prices</em> notes: “Seniors only need to look at the Department of Veterans Affairs to see a version of this in practice. Seniors should expect less access to critical drugs and treatments than they have today, and everyone will be harmed by lack of newer drugs and cures being developed as a result in the future.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) voted against the act and decried its Medicare reductions, stating: &#8220;After helping Joe Biden drive America into a recession and create the highest inflation in 40 years, Senate Democrats just doubled down on their attacks by targeting seniors, job creators and every American family. With their new reckless tax-and-spending spree, Democrats have launched a WAR ON SENIORS and a WAR ON AMERICAN JOBS that hikes taxes and will result in far fewer life-saving drugs.”</p>\n<p>A tracking poll by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that 27 percent of Americans over the age of 65 who take four or more medications are already <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/medicare-is-on-track-to-negotiate-drug-prices-what-it-means-for-you-11659972505\">having difficulties affording them</a>. Many on fixed incomes are also struggling to pay the higher prices being seen right now for nearly everything, from groceries to gas and rent, due to constantly increasing inflation.</p>\n<p>The U.S. currently pays <a href=\"https://inflation.news/\">significantly more money</a> than other countries for the same medications. For example, the prices in America of brand-name drugs amounted to more than three times the drug prices for brand-name medications in other countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>\n<p><strong>Sources for this article include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/08/09/war-seniors-democrats-cut-seniors-prescription-drug-benefits-ahead-midterms/\">Breitbart.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/06/how-medicare-prescription-drug-coverage-would-change-under-u-s-senate-democrats-bill/\">KansasReflector.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/medicare-is-on-track-to-negotiate-drug-prices-what-it-means-for-you-11659972505\">MarketWatch.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-senator-warns-inflation-reduction-war-seniors.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Senator warns Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act is a “war on seniors”\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-senator-warns-inflation-reduction-war-seniors.html&linkname=Senator%20warns%20Democrats%E2%80%99%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9Cwar%20on%20seniors%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-senator-warns-inflation-reduction-war-seniors.html&linkname=Senator%20warns%20Democrats%E2%80%99%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9Cwar%20on%20seniors%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-senator-warns-inflation-reduction-war-seniors.html&linkname=Senator%20warns%20Democrats%E2%80%99%20Inflation%20Reduction%20Act%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9Cwar%20on%20seniors%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-senator-warns-inflation-reduction-war-seniors.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 17:29:03', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '209', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

But when it comes to putting up a fight against Big Pharma and its drug dispensaries, the Golden State is often the leader of the pack.</p>\n<p>This was demonstrated once again with a recent <a href=\"https://www.blacklistednews.com/article/83103/judge-rules-walgreens-substantially-contributed-to-san-francisco-opioid.html\" target=\"_blank\">court ruling</a> out of San Francisco declaring the Walgreens pharmacy chain as a substantial contributor to the opioid crisis in the city.</p>\n<p>Walgreens shipped hundreds of thousands', 'of &#8220;suspicious orders,&#8221; according to U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, demonstrating its &#8220;fill, fill, fill culture&#8221; of drug distribution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Walgreens pharmacies in San Francisco dispensed hundreds of thousands of red-flag opioid prescriptions without performing adequate due diligence,&#8221; Breyer ruled using non-jury trial means – meaning Walgreens can be held liable for much of San Francisco&#8217;s opioid epidemic.</p>\n<p>Another trial will be held in the future, Breyer indicated, to determine the full extent of Walgreens&#8217; liability. (Related: An Ohio jury <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-29-jury-walmart-walgreens-cvs-guilty-opioid-epidemic.html\" target=\"_blank\">also found</a> both Walgreens and CVS guilty of fueling the opioid epidemic across the entire country.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Walgreens pharmacies in San Francisco dispensed hundreds of thousands of red-flag opioid prescriptions without performing adequate due diligence,&#8221; Breyer wrote in his ruling, which stems from the case of <i>City and County of San Francisco v. Purdue Pharma</i>, also known as the Opioid Trial.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The evidence showed that Walgreens did not provide its pharmacists with sufficient time, staffing, or resources to perform due diligence on these prescriptions.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<h2>Big Pharma and its drug dispensaries need to PAY for all the lives they&#8217;ve destroyed</h2>\n<p>The Opioid Trial is considered to be a &#8220;bellwether case&#8221; by federal courts because it has potential nationwide implications. If a success, drug chains like Walgreens could face convictions all across the land, possibly impacting the pharmaceutical industry as well.</p>\n<p>In San Francisco, Walgreens was the only drug chain to not reach a settlement with the city. Thus, Breyer is holding the company liable for its crimes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Walgreens has hidden, covered up, and run from the truth throughout the entirety of this five-year litigation,&#8221; said Peter Mougey, an attorney representing San Francisco and other municipalities in the area.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Walgreens knew its system to detect and stop suspicious orders was nonexistent but continued to ship opioids at an alarming pace to increase profits. San Francisco is now one step closer to starting the healing process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Between 2015 and 2020, overdoses of heroin and fentanyl skyrocketed in San Francisco. Data from the city shows a 478 percent increase in opioid-related deaths during that period, as well as a tripling of opioid-related emergency room visits.</p>\n<p>In 2020 alone, some 3,000 people in San Francisco had to be rushed to the hospital for an opioid overdose, a phenomenon that Breyer concluded was substantially contributed to by Walgreens&#8217; prescribing habits.</p>\n<p>Some people like to joke that California has a drug problem because of its left-wing politics. But the reality is that Big Pharma, which is supported and promoted by both the left and the right, is directly responsible for needles littering parks, as one example.</p>\n<p>City officials in San Francisco testified during the recent trial that at the height of the opioid crisis there, which was largely driven by pharmacies such as Walgreens, needles were being removed from city parks &#8220;like changing out the toilet paper in the restrooms,&#8221; to quote one park ranger.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone was spotted passed out and not breathing, rangers simply assumed that it was an opioid overdose because it typically was. And between 2006 and 2020, Walgreens dispensed more than 100 million prescriptions for opioid pills while failing to take appropriate actions to ensure they were legal, directly contributing to the city&#8217;s drug problem.</p>\n<p>According to reports, San Francisco is also pursuing $120 million in damages from seven drug manufacturers including Allergan, Teva, Endo Pharmaceuticals, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, along with distributors McKesson, Cardinal, and AmerisourceBergen.</p>\n<p>The latest news about the opioid epidemic can be found at <a href=\"http://badmedicine.news\" target=\"_blank\">BadMedicine.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blacklistednews.com/article/83103/judge-rules-walgreens-substantially-contributed-to-san-francisco-opioid.html\" target=\"_blank\">BlacklistedNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-29-jury-walmart-walgreens-cvs-guilty-opioid-epidemic.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walgreens-substantially-contributed-opioid-crisis-judge-rules.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Walgreens “substantially contributed” to opioid crisis, judge rules\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walgreens-substantially-contributed-opioid-crisis-judge-rules.html&linkname=Walgreens%20%E2%80%9Csubstantially%20contributed%E2%80%9D%20to%20opioid%20crisis%2C%20judge%20rules\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walgreens-substantially-contributed-opioid-crisis-judge-rules.html&linkname=Walgreens%20%E2%80%9Csubstantially%20contributed%E2%80%9D%20to%20opioid%20crisis%2C%20judge%20rules\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walgreens-substantially-contributed-opioid-crisis-judge-rules.html&linkname=Walgreens%20%E2%80%9Csubstantially%20contributed%E2%80%9D%20to%20opioid%20crisis%2C%20judge%20rules\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-walgreens-substantially-contributed-opioid-crisis-judge-rules.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 17:14:02', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '208', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

This is the globalist agenda, and it is rapidly taking shape in Western Europe where farmers protests are boiling over across the land.</p>\n<p>One video – <i>watch below</i> – shows farmers dumping and spraying with liquid large piles of manure that were dropped in front of the entrance to a government building.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"nl\">??

But first, the company <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-valneva-lyme-disease-vaccine-clinical-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">wants to</a> test them on little children.</p>\n<p>Lyme injections are the latest <i>pharmakeia</i> brew to be unveiled by Pfizer, which is reportedly in the final phase of testing. The only thing left to do is give the experimental', 'jabs to kids as young as five to see how their bodies respond. (Related: Pfizer was <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-10-31-fda-authorizes-pfizer-mrna-injections-children-five.html\" target=\"_blank\">also successful</a> in convincing the Food and Drug Administration to approve covid injections for children as young as five.)</p>\n<p>According to a press release, Pfizer and its French partner Valneva are enlisting 6,000 people age five and older to take VLA15, as the jab is called. If successful – meaning if Pfizer is able to hide enough of the negative data to make the shots appear &#8220;safe&#8221; – then it could be the first drug manufacturer to launch a vaccine for Lyme.</p>\n<p>A description of the trial at ClinicalTrials.gov reveals that &#8220;18,000 healthy participants 5 years and older&#8221; were recruited to participate. There was no explanation given as to the disparity between the 6,000 number used in the press release and the 18,000 number filed with the government.</p>\n<p>Pfizer describes VLA15 as a &#8220;multivalent protein subunit vaccine&#8221; that targets &#8220;the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia,&#8221; the bacteria that allegedly causes Lyme. The jab supposedly protects against six forms of the protein expressed by the bacterial species that is most prevalent in North America and Europe.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<h2>All new vaccines are apparently becoming &#8220;seasonal&#8221; to ensure constant profits for Big Pharma</h2>\n<p>According to <i>The Washington Post</i>, the phase 3 clinical trial participants will receive three doses of VLA15 or a placebo, followed by one &#8220;booster&#8221; dose or another placebo.</p>\n<p>It seems that seasonal shots and &#8220;boosters&#8221; are the new normal when it comes to vaccine injections, all thanks to the fraud that is Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) &#8220;vaccines&#8221; and the <i>plandemic</i> that made them happen.</p>\n<p>Pfizer is clearly hoping to bank on this new format for vaccines, which have to keep getting jabbed in people&#8217;s arms at regular intervals in order to &#8220;work.&#8221; No longer do vaccines provide actual immunity against disease, apparently.</p>\n<p>Now, they function much like heroin needles that need to constantly be injected in order to get a &#8220;hit.&#8221; Once the effects wear off, it is time for another hit – which, of course, means a steady stream of new profits for Pfizer.</p>\n<p>There is very little money to be made from a once-and-done injection format – you know, like how vaccines <i>used</i> to be. Now, everything is becoming &#8220;seasonal,&#8221; which assures Big Pharma an easy repeat of profits year after year.</p>\n<p>Pfizer&#8217;s goal is to obtain government approval both in Europe and North America for VLA15 to be commercially unleashed. Until then, the company plans to recruit trial participants at upwards of 50 different sites in both regions of the world.</p>\n<p>Pfizer senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development Annaliesa Anderson claims that her company needs to unleash these new jabs because of &#8220;increasing global rates of Lyme disease.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The reason they have to be seasonal, she told <i>The Associated Press</i> (AP), is supposedly because recipients will need a boost of antibodies every year when ticks, which are said to spread Lyme, are most active in the environment.</p>\n<p>There is also the tiny little problem of the shots&#8217; effectiveness waning over time. This was discovered in phase 2 testing – or so we are told. It is convenient that protection wanes because, once again, this means more profits for Pfizer with everyone having to take booster after booster every year for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p>The latest news about Pfizer can be found at <a href=\"http://evil.news\" target=\"_blank\">Evil.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-valneva-lyme-disease-vaccine-clinical-trial/\" target=\"_blank\">ChildrensHealthDefense.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-10-31-fda-authorizes-pfizer-mrna-injections-children-five.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-pfizer-targeting-children-with-lyme-disease-vaccines.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Pfizer now targeting children with new Lyme disease “vaccines”\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-pfizer-targeting-children-with-lyme-disease-vaccines.html&linkname=Pfizer%20now%20targeting%20children%20with%20new%20Lyme%20disease%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-pfizer-targeting-children-with-lyme-disease-vaccines.html&linkname=Pfizer%20now%20targeting%20children%20with%20new%20Lyme%20disease%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-pfizer-targeting-children-with-lyme-disease-vaccines.html&linkname=Pfizer%20now%20targeting%20children%20with%20new%20Lyme%20disease%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-pfizer-targeting-children-with-lyme-disease-vaccines.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '111', '2022-08-12 13:10:01', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:06:15', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '206', '', '', '1', '1', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Why on earth would TikTok need such people in its ranks if not to control what gets posted there and possibly even punish users who engage in &#8220;wrongspeak?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Silicon Valley is at least as fundamental a component of U.S. imperial narrative control as the legacy media and Hollywood, and is becoming even more so,&#8221; SCF warned. &#8220;Together they comprise the empire&#8217;s narrative control apparatus, which is just as essential to the functioning of the empire as its military or economic might.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Silicon Valley is filled with spooks and liars for the same reason the mainstream news media support every U.S. war and continually normalize the freakish injustices of our society: because whoever controls the narrative controls the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The latest news about Big Tech spying and surveillance can be found at <a href=\"http://technocrats.news\" target=\"_blank\">Technocrats.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2022/08/07/new-media-intertwined-with-imperial-power-as-old-media/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategic-Culture.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/038491_social_media_CIA_spying.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-facebook-fact-checkers-psyop-linked-to-cia.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Facebook’s “fact checking” groups are almost all government-funded psy-op entities tied to the CIA and other shadowy organizations\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-facebook-fact-checkers-psyop-linked-to-cia.html&linkname=Facebook%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cfact%20checking%E2%80%9D%20groups%20are%20almost%20all%20government-funded%20psy-op%20entities%20tied%20to%20the%20CIA%20and%20other%20shadowy%20organizations\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-facebook-fact-checkers-psyop-linked-to-cia.html&linkname=Facebook%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cfact%20checking%E2%80%9D%20groups%20are%20almost%20all%20government-funded%20psy-op%20entities%20tied%20to%20the%20CIA%20and%20other%20shadowy%20organizations\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-facebook-fact-checkers-psyop-linked-to-cia.html&linkname=Facebook%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cfact%20checking%E2%80%9D%20groups%20are%20almost%20all%20government-funded%20psy-op%20entities%20tied%20to%20the%20CIA%20and%20other%20shadowy%20organizations\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-facebook-fact-checkers-psyop-linked-to-cia.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 12:30:05', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '204', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

The most obvious purpose for that data is to sell people more useless, privacy-invading <i>things</i>. The other is to probe people&#8217;s privacy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While I’m interested to see how Amazon can leverage iRobot&#8217;s tech to improve its smart home ambitions, many are right to be concerned with the privacy implications,&#8221; Tuohy wrote.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;People want home automation to work better, but they don&#8217;t want to give up the intimate details of their lives for more convenience.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Amazon&#8217;s holdings create a near-complete picture of every detail of its customers&#8217; lives</h2>\n<p>If you are an Amazon customer who just loves the ease and convenience of paying way too much for products that in many cases can be purchased more cheaply straight from the vendor, then you should know the scope of Amazon&#8217;s prying into your personal life.</p>\n<p>For instance, Amazon now owns Ring, the doorbell spying company that films people and tracks activity in and around a property. Amazon also owns several other companies that give the mothership access to your medical records, grocery habits and more.</p>\n<p>Check out what Erica Joy, the chief technology officer at the DCCC, had to say in a tweet about how much access Amazon now has into its customers&#8217; lives:</p>\n<p>&#8220;information amazon will have about people:</p>\n<p>map of homes (astro / irobot / roomba)<br>\nmedical records (onemedical)<br>\nhome network activity (eero)<br>\nvoice samples (alexa)<br>\nvideo of homes (ring / blink home / astro)<br>\ngrocery habits (whole foods)<br>\nvehicle movement (echo auto)</p>\n<p>+ more i can&#8217;t fit here&#8221;</p>\n<p>Included in the &#8220;more i can&#8217;t fit here&#8221; are Amazon&#8217;s new Amazon Fresh stores, which are an Orwellian nightmare with thousands of cameras on the ceiling that watch and track your every move while shopping.</p>\n<p>At the Amazon Fresh checkout, a person who scanned his or her &#8220;mark of the beast&#8221; Amazon barcode at the entry turnstile merely has to walk out of the store through a different turnstile without having to go through a checkout line. Amazon later bills your credit card – before sending an itemized receipt, of course, so that customers cannot verify their purchases – and the purchase goes into a hidden Amazon database.</p>\n<p>If you care about privacy or even freedom for that matter, you will avoid Amazon and its many umbrella companies like the plague that they are.</p>\n<p>More of the latest news about Amazon can be found at <a href=\"http://evil.news\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.westernjournal.com/latest-amazon-acquisition-means-bezos-may-map-homes-interior-especially-one-laying-around/\" target=\"_blank\">WesternJournal.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2019-09-26-alexa-spying-installed-on-smart-faucets-toilets.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amazon-buys-irobot-gives-bezos-map-home.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Amazon buys iRobot, meaning Jeff Bezos may now have a map of your entire home\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amazon-buys-irobot-gives-bezos-map-home.html&linkname=Amazon%20buys%20iRobot%2C%20meaning%20Jeff%20Bezos%20may%20now%20have%20a%20map%20of%20your%20entire%20home\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amazon-buys-irobot-gives-bezos-map-home.html&linkname=Amazon%20buys%20iRobot%2C%20meaning%20Jeff%20Bezos%20may%20now%20have%20a%20map%20of%20your%20entire%20home\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amazon-buys-irobot-gives-bezos-map-home.html&linkname=Amazon%20buys%20iRobot%2C%20meaning%20Jeff%20Bezos%20may%20now%20have%20a%20map%20of%20your%20entire%20home\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-amazon-buys-irobot-gives-bezos-map-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 12:20:01', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '203', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

The private (for profit) prison will be happy to take you in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another wrote that she saw the cashless payment system at a Whole Foods store and asked the checkout clerk about it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I said I wasn&#8217;t into that stuff and she agreed,&#8221; this person added. &#8220;I said we are getting close to Revelation 13 and she agreed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>More of the latest news about Amazon and the ever-expanding reach of its corporate tentacles can be found at <a href=\"http://jeffbezoswatch.com\" target=\"_blank\">JeffBezosWatch.com</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/dozens-whole-foods-stores-allow-customers-pay-palm-print-biometric-data\" target=\"_blank\">ZeroHedge.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-06-30-whole-foods-mark-of-the-beast-amazon.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-whole-foods-stores-unveil-cashless-payment-system.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Dozens of Whole Foods stores in California unveil cashless payment system using the palm of your hand\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-whole-foods-stores-unveil-cashless-payment-system.html&linkname=Dozens%20of%20Whole%20Foods%20stores%20in%20California%20unveil%20cashless%20payment%20system%20using%20the%20palm%20of%20your%20hand\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-whole-foods-stores-unveil-cashless-payment-system.html&linkname=Dozens%20of%20Whole%20Foods%20stores%20in%20California%20unveil%20cashless%20payment%20system%20using%20the%20palm%20of%20your%20hand\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-whole-foods-stores-unveil-cashless-payment-system.html&linkname=Dozens%20of%20Whole%20Foods%20stores%20in%20California%20unveil%20cashless%20payment%20system%20using%20the%20palm%20of%20your%20hand\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-whole-foods-stores-unveil-cashless-payment-system.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 12:10:01', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '202', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Pelosi also shared her thoughts on Beijing&#8217;s escalating military action toward Taipei.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go [to Taiwan] to change our policy; we still support the One China Policy. We go there to acknowledge [that] the status quo is what our policy is. There is nothing disruptive about that,&#8221; the top lawmaker told Guthrie.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was only about saying China is one of the freest societies in the world. Don&#8217;t take it from me, that&#8217;s from Freedom House. It&#8217;s a strong democracy [with] courageous people, and it&#8217;s just – I don&#8217;t know why it is – except there&#8217;s some commercial interests who would like to diminish the relationship.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, the Washington, D.C.-based democracy think tank begs to differ.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores\">According to its Freedom in the World index</a> that observes 210 countries, Taiwan is ranked with a high 94 percent &#8220;free&#8221; rating. Meanwhile, mainland China only has a measly nine percent rating – putting it among more than 60 countries classified as &#8220;not free.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Pelosi&#8217;s claim during the Aug. 9 interview may have been a gaffe as she rightfully dubbed Taiwan as belonging to the &#8220;freest societies in the world&#8221; a week earlier.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The gaffe came amid the House speaker&#8217;s ill-advised trip to the island nation. President Joe Biden echoed the sentiments of military officials, who said the visit to Taipei was &#8220;not a good idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The White House later reversed course, saying that the chief executive &#8220;respects&#8221; Pelosi&#8217;s visit. It added that the visit aligns with American foreign policy going back decades.</p>\n<h2>Dems flip-flopping on their stance toward China</h2>\n<p>Beijing pushed forward with its threats of military action during and after Pelosi&#8217;s two-day visit to Taipei. Despite the U.S. insisting on the One China Policy, which considers Taiwan as a province of the mainland, this failed to mollify Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping. (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-08-china-suspends-dialogue-with-us-pelosi-taiwan.html\">China suspends dialogue with US following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s Taiwan visit.</a>)</p>\n<p>However, Washington has been inconsistent with its stance toward Taiwan. Many U.S. officials, including Biden himself, have said it may be necessary to deploy military assets in defense of Taiwan if China <a href=\"https://wwiii.news\">attempts to take the island by force</a>.</p>\n<p>In usual fashion, a White House spokesperson came to the president&#8217;s defense.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,&#8221; the spokesperson said. &#8220;He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Chinese tabloid <em>Global Times</em> responded to Pelosi&#8217;s visit by saying that U.S. politicians <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202208/1272195.shtml\">only cause &#8220;chaos and disaster&#8221;</a> to every nation they stand with. The tabloid is well known as a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party.</p>\n<p>&#8220;History repeatedly proves that US politicians will only bring about chaos and disaster to the people they said they stand with,&#8221; said the tabloid, quoting Chinese <em>Ministry of Foreign Affairs </em>spokeswoman Hua Chunying.</p>\n<p>The spokeswoman said during an Aug. 4 press conference: &#8220;Look at Iraq, Syria, Libya and Afghanistan – the &#8216;beautiful sight to behold&#8217; that Pelosi once said she would stand with – and the secessionists in China&#8217;s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. What happened to them now?&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Hua, <a href=\"https://communistchina.news\">Beijing&#8217;s military exercises</a> launched near Taiwan serve as a &#8220;warning&#8221; to &#8220;provocateurs&#8221; and &#8220;&#8216;Taiwan independence&#8217; secessionists.&#8221; She added that the exercises have nothing to do with regular people and will not cause any harm – as long as they do not support Taiwanese independence.</p>\n<p>Watch Sen.

These issues, he remarked, have little to do with the proper education of American children.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The NEA is a social justice union that&#8217;s really a female and transgender non-conforming. It&#8217;s just a combination of idiocy, but this is what they&#8217;re passing on to the kids,&#8221; stated Fiorazo, who added that the teachers union was voting on mandatory masking, creating an enemies list and rejecting words such as mother and father.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The show presented video clips of Pringle giving her speech during the NEA conference in Chicago. Pringle mentioned that Americans are now feeling the effects of a radicalized Supreme Court issuing decisions that do not reflect the views or the values of America.</p>\n<p>She added that the ground has shifted and the stage has been set to move the American people away from the promise of America for all Americans.</p>\n<h2>Educators are no longer hiding their political bias</h2>\n<p>Pringle also touched on several issues, such as decisions on school prayer that attack religious freedom and vouchers that threaten the right to universal public education. She also mentioned the long-term devastating impact of the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to hijack the fundamental freedom to decide when and how to have a family.</p>\n<p>Fiorazo noted that Pringle and the NEA are no longer hiding their political bias or agenda.</p>\n<p>According to Petrick, the purpose of education is to teach students how to think for themselves. It&#8217;s not possible when the educators themselves are pushing certain agenda.</p>\n<p>During her July 2022 speech, Pringle remarked that the NEA will &#8220;fight unceasingly&#8221; for the rights of LGBT students and educators. She promised that the teachers&#8217; union will encourage them to walk in their authenticity and to love themselves fully to be who they are meant to be. Fiorazo, however, expressed skepticism as this went against the image of how God made these students and teachers.</p>\n<p>Pringle also mentioned in her speech that she and other educators will continue to take seriously their responsibility as educators to teach students about America&#8217;s true and complete history through the so-called 1619 Project. (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-05-07-teachers-union-head-defends-critical-race-theory.html\" target=\"_blank\">Teachers union head defends indoctrinating children with critical race theory</a>.)</p>\n<p>Fiorazo lamented that the 1619 Project pushed by Pringle and the NEA is not true American history, but leftist and social justice woke history. Ultimately, Petrick said that leftist educators have been rewriting and revising history for decades.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://educationsystem.news\">EducationSystem.news</a> for more news about wokeness in the American educational system.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/7a1c5b68-8651-4cc9-beda-4f8f647b7b24\">Watch the video below</a> to know more about the woke agenda of the NEA and its president.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/freedomproject\">FreedomProject Media channel on <em>Brighteon.com</em></a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>More related stories:</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-07-07-nea-marxist-american-school-teachers-crt-racism.html\" target=\"_blank\">NEA goes full Marxist: American school teachers say they will teach anti-white CRT agenda regardless of laws</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-29-americans-not-paying-attention-shocking-changes-schools.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Duke Pesta tells Dr. Daniel Bobinski: Americans not paying attention to shocking changes in schools – Brighteon.TV</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://educationsystem.news/2022-07-13-public-schools-drugging-children-mind-altering-pharmaceuticals.html\">Public schools aren’t just grooming your children to become transgenders: They’re also drugging them with mind-altering pharmaceuticals</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include: </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/7a1c5b68-8651-4cc9-beda-4f8f647b7b24\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nea.org/about-nea/leaders/president\">NEA.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-nea-head-showing-how-to-brainwash-children.html\" data-a2a-title=\"NEA head teaches fellow educators how to BRAINWASH children\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-nea-head-showing-how-to-brainwash-children.html&linkname=NEA%20head%20teaches%20fellow%20educators%20how%20to%20BRAINWASH%20children\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-nea-head-showing-how-to-brainwash-children.html&linkname=NEA%20head%20teaches%20fellow%20educators%20how%20to%20BRAINWASH%20children\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-nea-head-showing-how-to-brainwash-children.html&linkname=NEA%20head%20teaches%20fellow%20educators%20how%20to%20BRAINWASH%20children\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-nea-head-showing-how-to-brainwash-children.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 11:48:03', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '200', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

– and anyone who says otherwise is drag-phobic.</p>\n<p>In fact, one drag queen called &#8220;Sasha Velour&#8221; who wrote an op-ed for the <i>Post</i> argues that it is drag-phobic for parents to <i>not</i> expose their children to drag queens at the youngest age possible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drafting laws to ban children from our performances is much less about the imagined sexual dangers of a drag show than the imagined dangers of failing to indoctrinate children with fear and shame around queerness from an early age,&#8221; Velour contends.</p>\n<p>In other words, <i>not</i> dragging children along to &#8220;family-friendly&#8221; drag shows will provoke them to feel fear and shame about LGBTs – especially the more flamboyant ones – while in public, according to Velour.</p>\n<p>Grooming children early to accept drag freaks as &#8220;normal&#8221; will also ensure that they much more readily accept any advances from LGBTs, including pedophiles who are targeting them for abuse.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Drag, certainly, is nothing dangerous,&#8221; Velour further claims, adding that &#8220;critics who cry otherwise do so because they don&#8217;t understand drag&#8221; and are just &#8220;recirculating deeply homophobic stereotypes about &#8216;grooming&#8217; to defend their campaign against queer and trans existence.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<h2>LGBTs say conservatives are the ones sexualizing drag shows for children</h2>\n<p>Velour and others like &#8220;her&#8221; claims that nothing about the LGBT movement, including risqué and cringeworthy drag shows, is sexual – even though the entire cult is centered around deviant sexuality.</p>\n<p>The only people claiming that drag shows where nearly-nude drag queens shake their synthetic body parts and swing around stripper poles are sexual are conservatives, Velour alleges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s telling that conservatives have centered the drag debate on children,&#8221; &#8220;she&#8221; says. &#8220;Drag is no less appropriate than other forms of entertainment. We edit our performances to be squeaky-clean for family-friendly audiences.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The only thing drag queens are actually doing, according to Velour, is empowering the next generation of youth to &#8220;develop empathy and tolerance&#8221; towards divergent lifestyles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A child who sees queens and kings onstage twirling in costume, acting absurd and authentic before all of society, is bound to develop&#8221; those things, Velour writes.</p>\n<p>Circulating footage of drag performances in both red and blue states, however, tell a much different story. Many of them feature scantily-clad men pretending to be women dancing on tables, teaching babies how to drop cash in their clothing like at a strip club, and attempting to normalize flagrant sexual behavior expressed through a clown suit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re showing kids sex clown shows, and I don&#8217;t know why anyone thinks that that&#8217;s a positive role model for any kid,&#8221; said Natasha Chart, a women&#8217;s rights campaigner, in an interview with <i>Breitbart News</i>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Really, you know, that&#8217;s being presented as like, this is kind of supposed to be an icon of femininity. So the girls are going to look at this and think, &#8216;Gosh, is that what I&#8217;m supposed to be when I grow up?\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ve been video of them doing sexy poses, doing twerking, flashing, collecting dollar bills, and encouraging kids to engage in that behavior and collecting money from the audience for an adult performance. Kids today have to say that they are demisexual – they&#8217;ve invented a sexual orientation for not wanting to have casual hookups.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Velour, use of <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2018-12-06-creepy-creator-of-drag-queen-story-hour-admits-to-grooming-children-to-become-transgender.html\" target=\"_blank\">the word &#8220;grooming&#8221;</a> to describe any of this is nothing but a &#8220;homophobic stereotype.&#8221; Sex-charged performances like drag shows, &#8220;she&#8221; insists, are &#8220;part of drag&#8217;s history.&#8221; They are also &#8220;how we have always found ways to transform the world around us to make room for our lives.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To keep up with the latest news about the drag craze, visit <a href=\"http://transhumanism.news\" target=\"_blank\">Transhumanism.news</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sources for this article include:</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/08/05/wapo-drag-show-for-children-are-squeaky-clean-family-friendly/\" target=\"_blank\">Breitbart.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2018-12-06-creepy-creator-of-drag-queen-story-hour-admits-to-grooming-children-to-become-transgender.html\" target=\"_blank\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-wapo-lgbt-drag-children-family-friendly.html\" data-a2a-title=\"Demonic Washington Post says LGBT drag shows for children are “family-friendly”\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-wapo-lgbt-drag-children-family-friendly.html&linkname=Demonic%20Washington%20Post%20says%20LGBT%20drag%20shows%20for%20children%20are%20%E2%80%9Cfamily-friendly%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-wapo-lgbt-drag-children-family-friendly.html&linkname=Demonic%20Washington%20Post%20says%20LGBT%20drag%20shows%20for%20children%20are%20%E2%80%9Cfamily-friendly%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-wapo-lgbt-drag-children-family-friendly.html&linkname=Demonic%20Washington%20Post%20says%20LGBT%20drag%20shows%20for%20children%20are%20%E2%80%9Cfamily-friendly%E2%80%9D\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-wapo-lgbt-drag-children-family-friendly.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 11:38:01', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '199', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Present were Syro-Malabar Rite Archbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara', 'of the Diocese of Faridabad and Auxiliary Bishop Deepak Valerian Tauro of the Archdiocese of Delhi. Tauro also serves as chairman of the country&#8217;s Pro-Life Commission.</p>\n<p>The event included a 2.5-kilometer &#8220;Jericho march&#8221; that began at the Jantar Mantar landmark in the capital. It ended at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, where Mass was subsequently celebrated. Funeral bells were then rung in remembrance of the millions of aborted babies over the last five decades. Given this, the march also served as a day of mourning.</p>\n<p>According to <em>LifeSiteNews</em>, the March for Life was organized by the Delhi Catholic Charismatic Service of Communion and CHARIS India – the official body of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services in the country.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the march also served as a protest against India&#8217;s Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTPA) of 1971. Bharanikulangara pointed out that since the law&#8217;s passing 51 years ago, India has seen an estimated 15.6 million abortions annually. This added up to a total of almost 800 million innocent children victimized by infanticide.</p>\n<p>Prior to the march, both Tauro and Bharanikulangara issued circular letters to priests in their respective dioceses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let us pray that the unjust killing of innocent and helpless children in wombs comes to an end,&#8221; the prelate for New Delhi wrote in a July 16 letter. He quoted St. Theresa of Calcutta, who said: &#8220;If a mother can kill her own child, what is left but for us to kill each other?&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>The prelate for Faridabad, meanwhile, expressed &#8220;great joy and exultation&#8221; over the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s overturning of the Roe v. Wade ruling in an Aug. 6 letter. He added that he hopes &#8220;to see a similar day in India&#8221; with the overturn of the MTPA. (Related: <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-06-26-supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-sending-issue-of-abortion-back-to-states-where-it-always-belonged.html\">Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, sending issue of abortion back to states where it always belonged.</a>)</p>\n<p>Bharanikulangara concluded his letter by echoing his fellow bishop&#8217;s sentiments: &#8220;Let us pray that the war in [the] womb also [comes] to an end.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Pro-life pushing back in India through the march</h2>\n<p>&#8220;It is an exciting time for the pro-life movement. As we&#8217;re seeing, the end of Roe v. Wade presents an opportunity and a cause for hope – because it demonstrates to countries like India that such unjust laws can be overturned,&#8221; said <a href=\"https://righttolife.org.uk/news/india-launches-first-annual-march-for-life-in-delhi\">Right to Life U.K. spokeswoman Catherine Robinson</a>.</p>\n<p>Robinson expressed optimism that the March for Life will &#8220;begin to create more of a pro-life culture&#8221; and pave the way for India to &#8220;experience its own overturning of its abortion laws.&#8221;</p>\n<p>March organizer Sister Paulina Melite told Right to Life UK that she hopes the event will &#8220;carry on for years to come&#8221; until the MTPA is completely revoked, in the same manner as Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p>Abortion is legal in India, thanks to the MTPA. The original version of the law decriminalized infanticide for up to 20 weeks of gestation, but the Indian parliament increased it to 24 weeks in 2021.</p>\n<p>Sex-selective abortion – in which baby girls are <a href=\"https://infanticide.news\">aborted due to their biological sex</a> – is also a significant issue in parts of India. Because of this practice, the country has an imbalanced sex ratio with significantly fewer girls being born than boys. A 2018 government report acknowledged this imbalance, noting that an estimated 63 million women were &#8220;missing&#8221; from the Indian population.</p>\n<p>In a bid to fix this gender imbalance and the issues that accompany it, New Delhi outlawed sex-selective abortion and prenatal sex detection in 1994.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://abortions.news/\">Abortions.news</a> for more stories about abortion in India and other countries.</p>\n<p>Watch this <em>LifeSiteNews</em> report about <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/23b1edfc-74e5-4474-8651-f94ecbb9806c\">pro-life men in Florida marching against abortion</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This video is from the <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/channels/lsntv\">LSNTV channel on <em>Brighteon.com</em></a>.</p>\n<h3>More related stories:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://vaccinewars.com/2022-01-10-march-for-life-cancels-expo-vaccine-compliance-spontaneous-abortions.html\">March for Life cancels annual expo, demands vaccine compliance for indoor event, pushing same jabs that are murdering babies and causing spontaneous abortions.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://newscartels.com/2018-04-03-media-networks-had-13x-more-coverage-of-march-for-our-lives-compared-to-march-for-life-and-no-coverage-at-all-of-the-march-against-monsanto.html\">Media networks had 13X more coverage of &#8220;March For Our Lives&#8221; compared to &#8220;March For Life&#8221; … and no coverage at all of the March Against Monsanto.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://infanticide.news/2019-10-15-mexicans-march-to-stop-abortion-genocide-lgbt-indoctrination.html\">PUSH BACK: 600,000 Mexicans erupt in massive public march to stop abortion genocide, LGBT indoctrination assault on their children.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/india-to-hold-first-march-for-life-as-day-of-mourning-for-nearly-800-million-aborted-children/\">LifeSiteNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://righttolife.org.uk/news/india-launches-first-annual-march-for-life-in-delhi\">RightToLife.org.uk</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/23b1edfc-74e5-4474-8651-f94ecbb9806c\">Brighteon.com</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-india-holds-first-march-for-life.html\" data-a2a-title=\"India holds first March for Life, commemorating almost 800 million victims of abortion\">\n<a class=\"a2a_button_facebook\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-india-holds-first-march-for-life.html&linkname=India%20holds%20first%20March%20for%20Life%2C%20commemorating%20almost%20800%20million%20victims%20of%20abortion\" title=\"Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_twitter\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-india-holds-first-march-for-life.html&linkname=India%20holds%20first%20March%20for%20Life%2C%20commemorating%20almost%20800%20million%20victims%20of%20abortion\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-india-holds-first-march-for-life.html&linkname=India%20holds%20first%20March%20for%20Life%2C%20commemorating%20almost%20800%20million%20victims%20of%20abortion\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div>\n<br /><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-12-india-holds-first-march-for-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Source link</a><br />', '1', '103', '2022-08-12 11:27:01', '82', '', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '0', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2022-08-13 01:11:14', '2032-08-10 01:11:21', '{}', '{}', '{}', '1', '198', '', '', '1', '0', '{}', '0', '*', '', ''),

Melissa Red Pill talked about the election fraud that happened in the recent <a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/bbda6934-d36a-4c1c-ad40-c8b9e1921ca9\">Arizona primary</a> and Lake&#8217;s victory during the Aug. 3 episode of the &#8220;Freedom Force Battalion&#8221; on <a href=\"http://brighteon.tv/home/\"><em>Brighteon.TV</em>.</a></p>\n<p>Election investigators Gregg Phillips and Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote said the Republican National Convention and Republican Party of Arizona&#8217;s poll observer program documented and reported multiple failures by Pinal County&#8217;s elections administrators during the state&#8217;s primary election.</p>\n<p>Most notable among the reported irregularities were the 63,000 mail-in ballots delivered to the wrong voters and the multiple Republican-heavy precinct locations that have run out of ballots. &#8220;This is a comprehensive failure that disenfranchises Arizonans and exemplifies why Republican-led efforts for transparency at the ballot box are so important,&#8221; Red Pill said.</p>\n<p>The host said Lake is a great leader and is no doubt a winner. &#8220;She gives every American a backbone aside from having a strong faith in God.&#8221; Lake is a <a href=\"http://www.karilake.com/kari-lake-bio\">former anchor for <em>Fox 10 News</em></a> in Phoenix.</p>\n<p>According to Red Pill, Lake winning as Arizona governor in the coming midterm election means that all the people involved in election fraud in the state are going to prison. She added that these people are fighting for their very lives now because they have committed treason and election fraud is a federal crime.

The former <em>Fox News</em> anchor mentioned that Arizona&#8217;s elected officials failed their citizenry when they never put in order the state&#8217;s election system.</p>\n<h2>Red Pill lauds Arizona for picking the right candidates</h2>\n<p>Red Pill also cited Mark Finchem, who got the secretary of state nomination for the GOP in Arizona. Finchem has also been talking about and exposing election fraud in the state.</p>\n<p>She then took a shot at Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who was blown out by Trump-backed David Farnsworth in the Republican primary election. She said Bowers was trying to stop Trump from giving the American people a free and fair election.</p>\n<p>The host lauded the people of Arizona for voting good people to run in positions for governor, legislators and secretary of state. &#8220;Americans need to have good people in federal government positions who will rule and judge with righteousness,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Red Pill went on to say that the primary is just the beginning of a gigantic red wave, which is indicative of what is going to happen in November. &#8220;Everything that is happening right now in the Joe Biden administration has made the American people realize what this present federal government is doing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://votefraud.news\">VoteFraud.news</a> for more news about America&#8217;s coming midterm elections.</p>\n<p>Watch the <a href=\"http://www.brighteon.com/bbda6934-d36a-4c1c-ad40-c8b9e1921ca9\">August 3 episode of the &#8220;Freedom Force Battalion&#8221; below</a>. &#8220;Freedom Force Battalion&#8221; with Melissa Red Pill airs every Wednesday at 11 a.m.-12 p.m. on <a href=\"https://brighteon.tv/home/\"><em>Brighteon.TV</em></a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><strong>More related stories:</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-02-08-clear-corruption-happened-during-2020-presidential-elections.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Red Pill: There was clear corruption during 2020 US elections – Brighteon.TV</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2022-03-29-county-clerk-bombshell-report-proves-election-fraud.html\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Red Pill: County clerk’s latest bombshell report is proof of election fraud – Brighteon.TV</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://votefraud.news/2022-06-03-media-now-admits-dominion-voting-systems-software-vulnerabilities.html\">Media now admits Dominion voting systems have “software vulnerabilities” which could allow them to be tampered with</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rigged.news/2022-07-14-biden-administration-plotting-federal-takeover-2022-midterms.html\">Vote fraud looms: Biden administration plotting a federal takeover of the 2022 midterm elections</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-15-serial-numbers-for-money-cars-guns-but-not-ballots-for-elections.html\" target=\"_blank\">We have serial numbers for money, cars and guns, but NOT for ballots for elections?

It may even be more <a href=\"https://www.naturalhealth365.com/gmo-foods-are-only-one-of-many-sources-of-glyphosate-exposure.html\">prevalent in organic foods</a> available on the market.</p>\n<p>Glyphosate, an ingredient found in weed killers like Roundup, has been linked to several types of cancer. In March 2015, the', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a &#8220;probable carcinogen&#8221; based on &#8220;limited evidence&#8221; showing that weed killer can cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lung cancer in humans.</p>\n<p>According to the independent science-based guide to wellness <em>OneDayMD</em>, evidence suggests that people would need to be extra cautious in choosing plant-based foods, especially when buying high-lectin foods such as beans, peas and potatoes, as the research showed that the desiccant paraquat becomes <a href=\"https://www.onedaymd.com/2022/07/shocking-news-about-beans-peas-and.html\">exponentially more hazardous</a> in combination with plant lectins.</p>\n<p>The said study found glyphosate contamination is present in many organic foods. Test results published in August 2018 by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) showed that 43 out of 45 food products made with <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2018/10/roundup-breakfast-part-2-new-tests-weed-killer-found-all-kids#.W3xuun4nY19\">conventionally grown oats tested positive</a> for glyphosate, 31 of which had glyphosate levels higher than EWG scientists believe would be safe for children.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the second round of testing found that glyphosate is a staple contaminant in Cheerios breakfast cereals and Quaker oats products. All 28 samples contained glyphosate; 26 were considered harmful to children&#8217;s health.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Five of 16 organic oat foods also contained low amounts of glyphosate, even though they&#8217;re supposed to contain none, as glyphosate is prohibited by the United States&#8217; organic standards. Testing was also done by Friends of the Earth, which found glyphosate in <a href=\"https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/glyphosate-in-oat-products\">100 percent of the 28 oat portions</a> of cereal sampled.</p>\n<p>The harmful chemical was also discovered in 30 percent of the samples of PediaSure Enteral Formula nutritional drink, which is given to infants and children via feeding tubes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also said to be in the air, rain, municipal water supplies, soil samples, breast milk, urine and even vaccines, including those for pneumococcal, Tdap, hepatitis B, influenza and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). The MMR vaccine had 25 to 34 times the amount of glyphosate than other vaccines, the researchers found.</p>\n<h2>CDC study finds glyphosate in 80 percent of urine samples</h2>\n<p>Convincing evidence that Americans are ingesting glyphosate from almost all the food they eat is the fact that it is readily detected in their urine. A study by the <em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em> has found that <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/glyphosate-us-urine.html\">80 percent of urine samples</a> of people of all ages in the U.S. contain the weed killer <a href=\"https://weedkiller.news/\">glyphosate</a>.</p>\n<p>The public health agency revealed this alarming result in its National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which stated that glyphosate was detected in 1,885 of 2,310 urine samples taken from Americans six years old and up.</p>\n<p>The June 30 NHANES report added that the amount of glyphosate in the urine samples was at detectable levels, reflecting the extent of the chemical&#8217;s infiltration throughout people&#8217;s systems.</p>\n<p>Phil Landrigan, director of <em><a href=\"https://www.bc.edu/\">Boston College</a></em>&#8216;s Program in Global Public Health and the Common Good, said people of all ages should be concerned about the NHANES findings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am particularly concerned for children,&#8221; he said, noting that they are more heavily exposed to pesticides than adults because they drink more water, eat more food and breathe more air.</p>\n<p>He further warned that children still have many years of future life that could be affected by diseases with long incubation periods, such as cancer.

Every area where lots of people got', 'injected has seen all-cause mortality skyrocket, the data shows.</p>\n<p>Since the second half of 2021, study author and computer scientist André Redert discovered, the Netherlands has seen a sharp uptick in his country&#8217;s &#8220;vaccination-correlated mortality-rate,&#8221; which now averages around 5 percent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This means that 5 percent of the deaths were distributed in ways consistent with vaccination rates,&#8221; explains Patrick Delaney, writing for <i>LifeSiteNews</i>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While this pattern does not prove these deaths were caused by the shots, it does prove that there is correlation between them, and plenty of evidence already exists of excessive death rates in highly vaccinated nations around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>EuroMOMO Bulletin says &#8220;an elevated level of excess mortality&#8221; persists across Europe</h2>\n<p>All this time, government authorities both in Europe and the United States have claimed that as more jabs get into more arms, sickness and death will decrease. What the data actually shows, however, is the <i>opposite</i>.</p>\n<p>The EuroMOMO Bulletin continues to publish reports indicating that &#8220;an elevated level of excess mortality&#8221; is being seen all across Europe. Just in the last several weeks, some 8,000 unaccounted-for deaths have been reported – and the jabs appear to be the culprit.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>&#8220;Though a 5% increase may seem modest, historically it is significant,&#8221; Delaney adds. &#8220;When applied to the United States, this would indicate an extra 175,000 deaths per year, and for Europe likely more than 400,000 &#8230; Furthermore, indications of these trends are not lacking.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The insurance industry has corroborated this with data showing a massive increase in death claims ever since Operation Warp Speed was launched by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>OneAmerica, an insurance carrier based out of Indianapolis, reported a 40 percent increase in death claims for the third quarter of 2021 when the jab campaigns were in full swing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three-sigma or a one-in-200-year catastrophe would be 10 percent increase over pre-pandemic,&#8221; announced company president Scott Davison. &#8220;So, 40 percent is just unheard of.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Steve Kirsch performed his own calculations on the various numbers that have been released or drudged up, leading him to the conclusion that covid jabs are, in fact, responsible for most, if not all, of the excess deaths that are being reported all around the world.</p>\n<p>The likelihood of this phenomenon happening by pure chance rather than as a result of covid injections is &#8220;basically never,&#8221; the MIT graduate declared, citing his work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In other words, the event that happened [to bring this about] is not a statistical &#8216;fluke,\'&#8221; he added. &#8220;Something caused a very big change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the third quarter of 2021 across the entire insurance industry, the Society of Actuaries Research Institute (SOA) discovered a 37.7 percent spike in life insurance death claims, which corroborates with OneAmerica&#8217;s data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That figure included an approximate 50-50 split between claims related to COVID-19 and those caused by other factors,&#8221; Delaney clarifies about how this figure was calculated.</p>\n<p>In Europe, German health insurer BKK ProVita reported to government officials &#8220;a very considerable under-recording of suspected cases of vaccination side effects after [patients] received the [COVID-19] vaccine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to board member Andreas Schöfbeck, &#8220;around 4%-5% of the vaccinated were under medical treatment for side effects,&#8221; which represents a rate about 10 times higher than what the German government was reporting.</p>\n<p>Fauci Flu shots are <i>deadly</i>.

Deepak Kaushal, director of the Southwest National Primate Research Center at Texas Biomedical Research Institute, recently admitted', 'to falsifying the number of treated and untreated primates in a 2020 study. However, he remained the director of Texas Biomed and ultimately oversaw the testing site that helped get Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines past the animal testing phase.</p>\n<h2>Research director confesses to multiple counts of research fraud</h2>\n<p>The incident at Texas Biomedical was not Kaushal’s first infraction. He also manipulated specific details in a tuberculosis treatment study published by the <em>American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</em>. The publisher had to retract the study because Kaushal manipulated the number of weekly doses that were administered as treatment for <em>mycobacterium</em> tuberculosis. <a href=\"https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.v203retraction1\">In the retraction</a>, the publishers said Kaushal &#8220;did not conform to a national protocol&#8221; but the publisher went with his conclusions anyway, stating, &#8220;the article&#8217;s conclusions may [still] be correct.&#8221; The research misconduct was originally exposed by an anonymous complaint sent to the publishers.</p>\n<p>Kaushal also fabricated data in two grant applications with the NIH, one filed in 2019 and the other in 2020. In the two grant applications, Kaushal claims to be affiliated with the Texas Primate Research Center and the Tulane Louisiana National Primate Research Center. Both institutions are still listed on the biography page of Kaushal&#8217;s website.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.brighteon.tv\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/images/BrighteonTV-WatchLiveShows.jpg\" alt=\"Brighteon.TV\"></a><p>\n</p>\n<p>Kaushal also oversaw the animal testing site that was used to push Pfizer’s COVID-19 jab into clinical trials. His record of fraud should call into question what actually happened during those animal trials. Previous animal trials for <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/\">coronavirus vaccines had caused pulmonary immunopathologies</a> that killed the test animals. Kaushal&#8217;s warp speed study concluded that Pfizer’s covid-19 vaccine protects macaques against the virus that causes covid-19. It was later <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03275-y\">published by <em>Nature</em></a> in 2021, but the results should be questioned.</p>\n<h2>Serial fraudster continues to conduct research and won’t be investigated for potential vaccine fraud</h2>\n<p>It turns out that Kaushal had to be disciplined at Texas Biomed because the president Dr. Larry Schlesinger said he was given &#8220;minimal consequences” for falsifying data. &#8220;Dr. Kaushal suffered internal consequences including significant oversight of his laboratory,&#8221; Schlesinger was quoted as saying. &#8220;Texas Biomed is confident that this will not happen again and that Dr. Kaushal can continue to lead the Southwest National Primate Research Center with competence and integrity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other researcher in the same field disagreed. Ronald Desrosiers, director of the New England Primate Research Center, said Kaushal&#8217;s employers should not keep him because his fraudulent work tarnished the industry&#8217;s reputation &#8212; not to mention a waste of taxpayer money. &#8220;Any scientist who intentionally and deliberately falsifies data for scientific publishing and/or receiving government funding should not be allowed to lead a research organization,&#8221; De Rossiers told <em>Science</em>.</p>\n<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Research Integrity recently conducted an audit of Kaushal’s work and discovered widespread malfeasance. However, he has not been fired or investigated for fraud that may have taken place during the animal trials that preceded covid-19 vaccine clinical trials. The clinical trials depended on diagnostic fraud, did not measure real-world vaccine effectiveness or <a href=\"https://naturalnews.com/2021-07-28-mathematically-impossible-covid-vaccines-useful-for-the-population.html\">consider absolute risk reduction</a>.

discernment process. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/affiliation-events\">According to the church\'s website</a>, 2,678 members – or 96.3 percent of voting members – voted to disaffiliate from the mainline Methodist denomination.</p>\n<p>Harper Pearson, Company, PC, of Houston, a Texas-based independent accounting firm, collected,', 'counted and certified the ballots during Sunday\'s vote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This church left their denomination because their pastor, leadership, and an overwhelming majority of believers wanted to affirm biblical teachings on sexuality rather than cave to the spirit of the age.</p>\n<p>This is evidence of a faithful church.</p>\n<p>From the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/texas-megachurch-votes-to-leave-umc.html\">Christian Post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Senior Pastor Mark Sorensen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thewoodlandsumc.org/affiliation-media\">posted a video</a> on the church\'s website saying that the vote affirmed that \"we are united in one vision and one clear mission.\"</p>\n<p>\"We are ready to move on past the division and the differences that have been an ongoing distraction in our denomination for far too long,\" said Sorensen. \"Remember, we are changing to stay the same. With this vote, we are preserving the ministry that we know and love.\"</p>\n<p>Sorensen \"offered a blessing\" to those who wanted to remain in the UMC, suggesting it is \"time to bless one another, even as we go our separate ways.\"</p>\n<p>\"In this there is no victory, in this there is no winner or loser,\" he added. \"We are called to pray for and lift up others in whatever ministry God has calling us to now and in the future.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\'m sure, unfortunately, that there are plenty of other gay-affirming Methodist churches nearby that the dissatisfied parishioners can join.</p>\n<div class=\"grid gap-5 max-w-lg mx-auto md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 md:max-w-none my-4\"><div class=\"md:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3 mx-auto\"></div></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the UMC Texas Annual Conference, more than 210 member congregations are considering disaffiliation from the denomination as of late July.</p>\n<p>The conference will host a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.txcumc.org/newsdetail/special-session-set-for-churches-exploring-disaffiliation-16582654\">special session</a> on Dec. 3 in Houston that will, among other things, include officially recognizing the departure of churches that have taken the necessary steps toward disaffiliation.</p>\n<p>Woodlands is not the only congregation to disaffiliatee from the Texas Conference on Sunday.
