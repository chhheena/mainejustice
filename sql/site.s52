These are serious allegations.  Whereas the sanctions are  directed against Russia, the ultimate intent is to undermine the legitimacy of president-elect Donald Trump and his foreign policy stance in relation to Moscow. </em></p>\n<p><em>According to the US media, the sanctions against Moscow were intended to<strong> &#8220;Box in President-elect Donald J. Trump&#8221; </strong>because  Trump &#8220;has consistently cast doubt&#8221; that Putin was involved in the alleged hacking of the DNC.  </em><em>In an earlier report on Kremlin meddling, the NYT  (December 15) depicted Donald Trump as<strong> &#8220;&#8230;a Useful Idiot&#8221;&#8230; </strong><strong>an American president who doesn’t know he’s being played by a wily foreign power.</strong> (emphasis added)</em></p>\n<p><em>But the accusations against Trump have gone far beyond the &#8220;Box in&#8221; Narrative.<strong> </strong>The unspoken truth pertaining to Obama&#8217;s Executive Order is that <strong>the punishment was intended for Trump rather than Putin.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>The objective is not to &#8220;Box-In&#8221; the president-elect for his &#8220;unfamiliarity with the role of intelligence&#8221;.

Unlikely. They are part of a propaganda campaign on behalf of powerful corporate interests.</p>\n<p>What is at stake is tantamount to a carefully coordinated operation to destabilize the Trump presidency, characterized by several distinct components.</p>\n<p>The central objective of this project against Trump is to ensure the continuity of the Neocons&#8217; foreign policy agenda geared towards global warfare and Worldwide economic conquest, which has dominated the US political landscape since September 2001.</p>\n<p>Let us first review the nature of the Neocons&#8217; foreign policy stance.</p>\n<h2><strong>Background on The Neocons&#8217; Foreign Policy Agenda</strong></h2>\n<p>In the wake of 9/11, two major shifts in US foreign policy were devised as part of the 2001 National Security Strategy (NSS).</p>\n<p>The first pertained to the &#8220;global war on terrorism&#8221; against Al Qaeda, the second introduced the preemptive &#8220;defensive war&#8221; doctrine. The objective was to present &#8220;preemptive military action&#8221; &#8211;meaning war as an act of &#8220;self-defense&#8221; against two categories of enemies, &#8220;rogue States&#8221; and &#8220;Islamic terrorists&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">&#8220;The war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. …America will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed.(National Security Strategy, White House, 2002, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html\">http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p align=\"justify\">The preemptive war doctrine also included the preemptive use of nuclear weapons on a &#8220;first strike&#8221; basis (as a means of &#8220;self-defence&#8221;) against both nuclear and non-nuclear states. This concept of  a preemptive first strike nuclear attack was firmly endorsed by Hillary Clinton in her election campaign.</p>\n<p>In turn, the &#8220;Global War on Terrorism&#8221;(GWOT) launched in the wake of 9/11 has come to play a central role in justifying US-NATO military intervention in the Middle East on &#8220;humanitarian grounds&#8221; (R2P), including the instatement of so-called &#8220;No Fly Zones&#8221;. GWOT also constitutes  the cornerstone of media propaganda.</p>\n<p>The military and intelligence dimensions of the Neocons&#8217; project are contained in<strong> The Project for the New American Century</strong> formulated prior to the accession of George W. Bush to the White House. The PNAC also posits a &#8220;Revolution in Military Affairs&#8221; requiring a massive budget outlay allocated to the development of advanced weapons systems including a new generation of nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-neocons-project-for-the-new-american-century-american-world-leadership-syria-next-to-pay-the-price/5305447\">The PNAC initiative was launched by William Kristol and Robert Kagan </a>whose wife Victoria Nuland, played a key role as Clinton&#8217;s Assistant Secretary of State in engineering the Euro-Maidan coup in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The Neocon project also includes a menu of &#8220;regime change&#8221;, &#8220;color revolutions&#8221;, economic sanctions and macro-economic reforms directed against countries which fail to conform to Washington&#8217;s demands.</p>\n<p>In turn, the globalization of war supports Wall Street&#8217;s global economic agenda: The (secretly negotiated) Atlantic and Pacific trade blocks (TPP, TTIP, CETA, TISA), coupled up with IMF- World Bank- WTO &#8220;surveillance&#8221; are an integral part of this hegemonic project, intimately related to US military and intelligence operations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-5404338 aligncenter\" title=\"project-new-american-century\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century.jpg 512w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/project-new-american-century-400x232.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"></a></p>\n<h2><strong>&#8220;The Deep State&#8221; and The Clash of Powerful Corporate Interests</strong></h2>\n<p>Global capitalism is by no means monolithic. What is at stake are fundamental rivalries within the US establishment marked by the clash between competing corporate factions, each of which is intent upon exerting control over the incoming US presidency. In this regard,  Trump is not entirely in the pocket of the lobby groups. As a member of the establishment, he has his own corporate sponsors and fund raisers. His stated foreign policy agenda including his commitment to revise Washington&#8217;s relationship with Moscow does not fully conform with the interests of the defence contractors, which supported Clinton&#8217;s candidacy.</p>\n<p>There are powerful corporate interests on both sides, which are now clashing. There are also overlapping allegiances and &#8220;cross-cutting alliances&#8221; within the corporate establishment.  What we are witnessing are  &#8220;inter-capitalist rivalries&#8221; within the spheres of banking, oil and energy, the military industrial complex, etc.</p>\n<p>Is &#8220;The Deep State&#8221; divided?  These corporate rivalries are also characterized by strategic divisions and clashes within several agencies of the US State apparatus including the intelligence community and the military.  In this regard, the CIA is deeply embedded in the corporate media (CNN, NBC, NYT. WP, etc) which is waging a relentless smear campaign against  Trump and his alleged links to Moscow.</p>\n<p>But there is also a  countervailing campaign within the intelligence community against the dominant Neocon faction. In this regard, the Trump team is contemplating a streamlining of the CIA (aka purges). According to a member of the Trump transition team (quoted by the Wall Street Journal, January 4, 2017), “<em>The view from the Trump team is the intelligence world [is] becoming completely politicized, &#8230; They all need to be slimmed down. The focus will be on restructuring the agencies and how they interact.”</em> This project would also affect CIA operatives responsible for propaganda embedded within the mainstream media. This would inevitably create profound divisions and conflicts within the US intelligence apparatus, which could potentially backlash on the Trump presidency. it is unlikely that a Trump administration would be able to undermine the inner structures of US intelligence and CIA sponsored media propaganda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yiv0590505064realtor\"><strong>Continuity in US Foreign Policy? </strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-5400090\" title=\"kennan\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"192\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan.jpg 400w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennan-246x300.jpg 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\"></a>Crafted in the late 1940s by US State Department official George F. Kennan, the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221; sets the ideological foundations of America&#8217;s post-war hegemonic project.  What these State department documents reveal is continuity in US foreign policy  from “Containment” during the Cold War to today’s post 9/11 doctrine of “Pre-emptive Warfare”.</p>\n<p>In this regard, the Neocons&#8217; <strong>Project for the New American Century’s</strong> blueprint (cited above) for global conquest should be viewed as the culmination of a post-war agenda of military hegemony and global economic domination formulated by the State Department in 1948 at the outset of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, successive Democratic and Republican administrations, from Harry Truman to George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been involved in carrying out this <strong>hegemonic blueprint for global domination</strong>, which the Pentagon  calls the “Long War”.</p>\n<p><a title=\"kennanbook\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennanbook.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox[5400067]\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"kennanbook\" src=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennanbook.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"92\" height=\"142\"></a>In this regard, the Neocons have followed in the footsteps of  the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221;. In the late 1940s, George F. Kennan called for building <strong>a dominant Anglo-American alliance</strong> based on “good relations between our country and [the] British Empire”.  In today’s world, this alliance largely characterizes the military axis between Washington and London, which plays a dominant role inside NATO to the detriment of Washington’s  (continental) European allies.  It also includes Canada and Australia as key strategic partners.</p>\n<p>Of significance, Kennan underscored the importance of <strong>preventing the development of continental European powers</strong> (e.g. Germany, France, Italy) which could compete with the Anglo-American axis. The objective during the Cold War and its aftermath was to prevent Europe from establishing political as well as economic ties with Russia. In turn, NATO largely dominated by the US has prevented both Germany and France from performing a strategic role in World affairs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Trump Foreign Policy Realignments</strong></h2>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that a Trump administration would depart from the mainstay of US foreign policy.</p>\n<p>While the Trump team is committed to a socially regressive and racist right wing agenda on the domestic front, certain foreign policy realignments are possible including a softening of the sanctions against Russia, which could potentially have an impact on the multibillion dollar contracts of the military industrial complex. This in itself would be a significant achievement which could contribute to a period of Detente in East-West relations.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while Trump has put together a right wing cabinet of generals, bankers and oil executives,  which largely conforms to the mainstay of the Republican Party, the bi-partisan &#8220;entente cordiale&#8221; between Democrats and Republicans has been broken. Meanwhile, there are powerful  voices within the GOP who are supportive of the &#8220;anti-Trump faction&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The divisions between these two competing factions are nonetheless significant. With regard to US foreign policy, they largely pertain to US-Russia bilateral relations which have been jeopardized by the Obama administration as well as to the ongoing US military agenda in Syria and Iraq. They also have a bearing on the European Union, which has been affected by Obama&#8217;s economic sanctions against Russia.</p>\n<p>The sanctions have resulted in a dramatic decline in EU trade and investment with the Russian Federation. In conformity with the &#8220;Truman Doctrine&#8221; discussed above, US foreign policy under the Neocons, particularly since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, had sought <strong>to dismantle the Franco-German alliance and weaken the European Union.</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Of relevance in relation to recent developments in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, George F. Kennan explicitly pointed in his 1948 State Department brief, to<strong> “a policy of containment of Germany, within Western Europe”. </strong>What Kennan’s observations suggest is that the <strong>US should be  supportive of  a European Project only inasmuch as it supports US hegemonic interests. </strong>And that is precisely what the Neocons have achieved under the Bush and Obama administrations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today both Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel are taking their orders directly from Washington. The 2003 invasion of Iraq was a turning point. The election of pro-US political leaders (President Sarkozy in France and Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany) was conducive to a weakening of national sovereignty, leading to the demise of the Franco-German alliance. &#8221; (Michel Chossudovsky <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/americas-blueprint-for-global-domination-from-containment-to-pre-emptive-war-the-1948-truman-doctrine/5400067\">America’s Blueprint for Global Domination: From “Containment” to “Pre-emptive War”.</a> Global Research, 2014)</p></blockquote>\n<p>The more significant question is whether this realignment under a Trump administration will restrain the deployment of NATO troops and military hardware in Eastern Europe on Russia&#8217;s doorstep. Will it be conducive to nuclear disarmament?</p>\n<p>While Trump&#8217;s foreign policy agenda has been the target of &#8220;dirty politics&#8221; by the Clinton faction, the new administration has powerful corporate backers who will no doubt challenge the Neocons including those operating within the intelligence community. It is worth noting that Trump also has the support of the pro-Israel lobby as well as Israeli intelligence.

While the MSM routinely criticize politicians in high office including the president of the US, the media narrative in this case is fundamentally different. The incoming president is the target of an organized media smear campaign which will not subside upon Trump&#8217;s accession to the White House.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, an engineered and coordinated protest movement against Trump has been ongoing since November 8. In fact it started on the evening of November 8 prior to the announcement of the election results.  The protests have all the appearances of  a &#8220;color revolution&#8221; style op.</p>\n<p>The media also provides a biased coverage of the engineered protest movement.

it has seen the pro-Western media machine cultivate and disseminate disinformation, propaganda and fake news on a previously unseen scale. While the U.S. and its NATO allies prosecute their proxy conflict on the ground, in the air, and at sea, another illicit battle is being fought on social media, TV and radio.</p>\n<p>Of course, propaganda and the winning of “hearts and minds” is nothing new when it comes to conflict. As far back as the 19th century Governments were aware of how important the narrative was at home, they actively sought to suppress details which they thought may be offensive or unhelpful to the home audience.</p>\n<p>In the second Boer war in South Africa (1899-1902), when the British Army’s colonial war was failing it resorted to imprisoning Boer Women and children in vast ill equipped concentration camps where a stunning 26,000 of them would die from starvation, ill treatment and disease. The British actively considered creating a publicity campaign to hide the true horror of the hellish camps, including false reports and newspaper stories.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44124 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=674%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?w=674&amp;ssl=1 674w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?resize=150%2C89&amp;ssl=1 150w\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"331\" data-attachment-id=\"44124\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/13/war-propaganda-about-ukraine-starting-to-wear-thin/word-image-44120-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=674%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"674,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"word-image-44120-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-44120-3.jpeg?fit=674%2C400&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Black woman in British concentration camp in the Boer War.

As far as the public were concerned the Kaiser was the killer, the Germans ate Belgian babies and the repulsive Teutonic octopus had to be stopped at all costs.</p>\n<p>Of course, the fact that the entire conflict was about imperial power, commerce and competition between the three grandchildren of the British Queen Victoria was conveniently ignored. In July 1916 British newspaper reports on the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest battles in human history, famously read “Our casualties are not heavy,” an utterly misleading headline which sounds disturbingly familiar today.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>When we consider Americas most recent large-scale military misadventures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya these ill-advised and bloody failures have yet again been portrayed as the “good guys against the bad guys”, it’s the Cowboys against the Indians, the dangerous and untrustworthy Muslim savages against the very existence of Western civilisation.</p>\n<p>The immeasurable human suffering that these wars have visited on the innocent populations seldom features. American complicity and responsibility for creating the very problems they now seek to “solve” is bizarrely entirely ignored in its client media.</p>\n<p>Today’s conflict in Ukraine is no exception, a similar narrative is peddled with the historical truths about where conflict grew from remaining unreported. Some of the most critical facts relating to Ukraine are routinely and conveniently rendered invisible by the mainstream media, such as when this civil war began and most crucially, who paid for and built the scaffolding on which it is now burning.</p>\n<p>It is of course unpopular in any instance to swim against the flow of the tide, to be the child suggesting the emperor has no clothes, and to challenge “realities” that have been broadly accepted by a trusting public. Despite the gross imbalance in the presentation of the facts, up to now at least dissent was something accepted as a privilege of western democratic society, that freedom of speech and opinion is however in grave danger, particularly if it is based on inconvenient truths.</p>\n<h2><strong>The “Absolute Truth”</strong></h2>\n<p>When it comes to Ukraine <strong>a new, dangerous and lavishly funded weapon in the counter truth war has been deployed by western governments and media,</strong> I call it “Absolute Truth”. The Absolute truth doesn’t tolerate any challenges, when its allegations are proven false those realities are suppressed and ignored.</p>\n<p>It immediately and efficiently targets any dissent from the prescribed narrative and brands challengers as “enemies,” “foreign agents,” or “useful idiots.” Critically there is no room for debate of any kind, there is no analysis of facts, there is only their Absolute Truth.</p>\n<p>Should a journalist, State or individual question this Absolute Truth or merely suggest an objective analysis of the facts they are immediately and brutally marginalised and then targeted for retribution. This determined and choreographed punishment can range from the loss of a job to the isolation of an entire nation with threats of violence commonplace.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44159 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=696%2C696&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?resize=696%2C696&amp;ssl=1 696w\" alt=\"\" width=\"464\" height=\"464\" data-attachment-id=\"44159\" data-permalink=\"https://covertactionmagazine.com/2022/08/13/war-propaganda-about-ukraine-starting-to-wear-thin/1385077_orig/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1385077_orig\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/covertactionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1385077_orig.jpg?fit=696%2C696&amp;ssl=1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BowesChay/status/1505248984255840261/photo/1\">twitter.com</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>The fact that the West’s “Absolute Truth” narrative relies implicitly on mass censorship and the wholesale destruction of freedom of speech</strong> is apparently irrelevant to its architects and disciples, if these pillars of liberal democracy must be abandoned in this war against the facts, so be it.</p>\n<p>Absolute truth also has a selective attitude when it comes to the behavior of its idols, when Mr Zelensky’s election with the assistance, cash and muscle of a corrupt oligarch is highlighted this is ignored, when his antidemocratic banning of all opposition and the imprisonment of its leaders comes up, its fine. if the Absolute Truth requires the acceptance and deployment of brutal Nazi militias against civilians, (previously designated by the west as terrorists) that is again entirely acceptable.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Absolute truth brigade have a magical ability to erase history, assign hero status to mass murders (Stepan Bandera) and demonise those that defeated Nazism in Europe. The Absolute Truth now defines the narrative, the facts do not, facts and independent evidence will be selectively deployed if at all, those that challenge this are immediately designated as collaborators, war mongers and enemies of democracy.</p>\n<p>Another sinister element of the cult of Absolute Truth is the reluctance to correct the record or admit when you get it wrong, from the “massacre” at Snake Island that never happened to the fake headlines about the Mariupol maternity hospital to name but a few, there is never any attempt to correct the record which begs the question how sincere were the allegations in the first place?</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-44128 aligncenter\"

the internationally respected Amnesty international bravely countered the Absolute truth with indisputable facts, it was itself attacked by an increasingly paranoid Zelensky.</strong> There is now a distinct element of “the boy who cried wolf” about Zelensky’s persistent and now routine allegations of genocide, targeting of civilians and the apparent desire to “erase Ukraine from the map”.</p>\n<p>Any cursory examination of the facts around the Ukrainian Army’s “counter terrorist” operation against its own people in 2014 in Donbas would suggest it was an increasingly radicalised Ukrainian military that first assaulted the ethnic Russian populations in the east in 2014.</p>\n<p>As NATOs exceptionally costly and increasingly destructive proxy war against Russia grinds on, the prospect of any military victory for Ukraine fades almost hourly, the likelihood that Russia will seek settlement also fades by the day, any incentive to do so now strategically valueless.</p>\n<p>Western support for Zelensky’s seemingly rudderless and incompetent regime is privately wavering as the impact of ham-fisted sanctions against Russia threatens social cohesion in Europe and America alongside a global energy crisis.</p>\n<p>Promised counter offensives in the south have not materialized, the much vaunted “Million-man army” has failed to appear and yet again, the American and European press that presented this as fact have not rowed back on their outlandish claims.</p>\n<p>The harsh reality of war is seemingly lost on the “absolute Truth” brigade who are happmericy to “stand with Ukraine” but will never stand in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The western public are a fickle audience, given the lack of initial scrutiny generally applied to the mainstream narrative on Ukraine it’s likely that as more of the inconvenient truths about Zelensky, his junta and the realities of this conflict appear, more and more westerns will be creeping into their yards in the dead of night to take down their hastily hoisted Ukrainian flags.</p>\n<p>Contrary to the best efforts of those that have funded, molded and justified this proxy war the truth has a habit of resurfacing. It will be impossible to “manage” the oncoming tide of reality that will gush out of Ukraine as the western powers refocus on their self-inflicted domestic troubles this winter, Zelensky himself may become the fall guy for the failed NATO escapade in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing about those inconvenient facts, they keep persisting under the surface, the truth doesn’t have a sell by date, and it is patient, the memory of the countless dead demands it to be.</p>\n<p>And of course, as good old Abraham Lincoln said, “You can fool part of the people some of the time, you can fool some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.”</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Cynthia McKinney, former member of US Congress</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">In a press conference on Wednesday 10 August, former<strong> President Donald Trump</strong> said that on Monday, two days earlier, more than 30 FBI agents raided his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The FBI refused to allow Mr. Trump’s attorney or any other witnesses to be present during the razzia which lasted over 9 hours.  Mr. Trump was suggesting they might have used the opportunity to plant evidence against him.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">And why not?</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\"><a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-5672933 alignright\" src=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"159\" srcset=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1.jpg 1143w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1-300x179.jpg 300w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1-768x458.jpg 768w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1-1024x611.jpg 1024w, https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/trump-1-400x239.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\"></a>It is clear that the Trump residence Mar-a-Lago raid was not about a bunch of documents that he may have taken with him from the White House. It was about much more. And it is not over yet. US<strong> Attorney General Merrick Garland</strong>, has intimated that never before in the Justice Department’s 152-year history, was such an extensive investigation of a former President carried out.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">&#8220;These are dark times for our nation,&#8221; former President Trump declared in response to the FBI’s  Monday morning raid on his Mar-a-Lago private residence. He compared the event to &#8220;an assault&#8221; that &#8220;could only take place in broken, Third-World countries.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The President of the Palm Beach Freedom Institute, Paul du Quenoy, calls the The Mar-a-Lago Raid a <i>Desperate Act of a Corrupt Establishment</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">The former President remains a political force to be reckoned with, as <strong>he claims the 2020 elections were stolen and he allegedly has proof that it was.</strong> Yet, the documented proof was not even admitted to be examined in any of the State Courts, to which he presented it, nor by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\"><strong>Whether Trump’s case was right or wrong is of lesser importance. The outright rejection of looking at a case presented by a former President is so unusual that it raises a myriad of questions.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">Donald Trump’s 2016 election win took many by surprise. How can the public elect such a clown, was the general mainstream media reaction. Throughout his Presidency – and even before – he was lambasted in the US and around the world in ways no former US President was dealt with by international diplomacy and media.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\"><strong>Is it because Mr. Trump, against all odds and against the past and present wannabe world trend, is not a globalist, but a staunch nationalist?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">It is the times of the Globalists. There is no more left and right, socialism and communism, Democrats and Republicans. There are only globalists and anti-globalists.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">The World Economic Forum, or WEF-driven global agenda – under the Great Reset and UN Agenda 2030 drives towards a One World Order (OWO), run by a small elite.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">The WEF’s eternal CEO, <strong>Klaus Schwab,</strong> has made it clear during the last WEF Conference in May 2022 in Davos, that <i>“We have the Means to Improve the State of the World.” </i>What he really meant to say is that, <strong>we this small but important group of people in this room have the power to impose the shape of the world. See <a href=\"https://www.globalresearch.ca/world-economic-forums-klaus-schwab-we-have-the-means-to-impose-the-state-of-the-world/5787719\">this</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>This concept of taking full control of the world, is one of the corporate financial giants of the sorts of BlackRock, Vanguard, StateStreet and more of Wall Street banking titans and private billionaire oligarchs. The WEF, generously funded by them, represents their extremely powerful interests around the globe. See <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/about/leadership-and-governance\">WEF Leadership and Governance</a> – Board of Trustees and more.</p>\n<p>This One World Globalist concept is diametrically opposed to the world vision of Donald Trump. He is a nationalist à la “Make America Great Again” and wants the US to continue in a leading role in the world. But contrary to what the media have been indoctrinating the world at large with, not as a sole empire, but rather as a key player in a multi-polar world.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">During the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2020, Mr. Trump called upon the leaders of all countries, recommending to them to do likewise for their countries, make them strong, independent, as autonomous sovereign nations. This is not precisely a globalist view. But it is a view liked by most countries – and even more so by the people around the world.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">By now, most everybody knows that a One World Order would be equal to a One World Tyranny, an OWT.  For that reason, in the hearts of people and many politicians in the US and around the world, Mr. Trump is very popular.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">Of course, most of them don’t dare to say so, because the media has slandered Trump and his, as well as any non-globalist views to such an extent, that openly admitting a sovereign nationalist opinion, would be looked at as utterly shameful.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">It is therefore no coincidence that last Wednesday, 10 August 2022, just two days after the FBI raid on his residence, the former President was subpoenaed to appear before the New York State Attorney General (AG),<strong> Letitia James,</strong> for a six-hour deposition on his real estate company’s business practices. Except for stating his name, Trump repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Other than that, not much transpired to the public from this deposition.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\"><strong>What is interesting is not the deposition in itself, but the two apparently independent parallel events against a former President, the FBI raid of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, and the six-hour questioning by the New York State Attorney General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">These legal actions against the former President will be blown out of proportion by the media, so as to diminish his power and chances to run again for President in 2024; and they are also aiming at preventing the Republicans – most of whom support Trump &#8211; to take over both the House and the senate in the Mid-Term Elections this coming fall.</p>\n<p class=\"yiv2819153067ydpd2c3fb05yiv5148552074MsoNormal\">Although Trump said he would announce in September 2022 whether he plans to run for President in 2024, this recent video looks like “candidate” Trump is already on his campaign trail – <a href=\"https://t.me/PresidentQ45Q/172\">on Telegram channel</a>, sounding like a Trump Comeback Speech.</p>\n<p>If elections were held today, Trump would beat Biden by a landslide of 45 to 32, or by a margin of 40%. See <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-trounce-joe-biden-election-held-again-polls-suggest-1653256\">Newsweek poll</a>.</p>\n<p>It is clear, these legal fiascos – and there may be more to come &#8211; are last-ditch efforts to prevent the WEF’s Globalists House of Cards Would-be-Empire from further disintegrating. The crumbling Globalist Cult will do whatever they can to prevent Donald Trump from running for President in 2024.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Chief among these deceptive tactics is Washington’s weaponization of accusations that its adversaries violate the freedom of expression.</em></p>\n<p><em>This is quite ironic, given that the United States is the world’s leading violator of press freedoms, according to any consistent definition of the term.</em></p>\n<p><em>And unlike the countries that Washington claims supposedly repress the freedom of expression within their borders, US government censorship of independent media outlets and suppression of alternative voices is global, hurting people across the planet.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Joe Biden administration has in particular gone to great lengths to depict itself as a defender of civil liberties.</em></p>\n<p><em>In May, the White House published a statement commemorating <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/03/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-occasion-of-world-press-freedom-day-2022/\">World Press Freedom Day</a>. The purpose of the declaration was to portray Russia as a leading violator of free speech and the United States as its noble protector.</em></p>\n<p><em>But the reality is Washington is guilty of exponentially more persecution of journalists than anything Moscow is even accused of.</em></p>\n<h2><strong>US government persecution of Julian Assange threatens freedom of speech everywhere on Earth</strong></h2>\n<p>There is no more gruesome symbol of the ludicrous hypocrisy of the United States portraying itself as a protector of press freedoms than its authoritarian persecution of the most famous journalist on Earth: Julian Assange.</p>\n<p>The US government’s ruthless attack on Assange, the founder and publisher of whistleblowing journalism website WikiLeaks, is likely the worst blow to freedom of speech carried out by any government in history, with dangerous implications for all human beings on the planet.</p>\n<p>The US case against Assange essentially amounts to a criminalization of journalism.</p>\n<p>Washington is seeking to extradite and prosecute Assange, an Australian national who has never lived in the United States, for the “crime” of publishing truthful information exposing US war crimes – in other words, for doing the kind of journalism that any good reporter should do.</p>\n<p>Assange is facing up to 175 years in prison on 18 charges. If it succeeds in the extradition process, the United States will likely throw the WikiLeaks publisher in a medieval-style dungeon, where he will be held in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>Due to persecution by the United States and United Kingdom, Assange has already been essentially imprisoned for a decade. Starting in 2012, the WikiLeaks journalist sought refuge in Ecuador’s embassy in London. He would end up being trapped there for seven years.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2016/02/working-group-arbitrary-detention-deems-deprivation-liberty-mr-julian-assange\">United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> determined that Assange had been “arbitrarily detained” and should be released and given compensation.</p>\n<p>The British government ignored the UN legal experts. Instead, in 2019, UK authorities violated Ecuador’s territorial integrity, entered the embassy, and kidnapped Assange (who by that time was a naturalized Ecuadorian citizen, in addition to his Australian nationality).</p>\n<p>Since 2019, Assange has been subjected to draconian treatment in Britain’s maximum-security Belmarsh prison, held alongside people convicted of “terrorism,” murder, and other violent crimes.</p>\n<p>The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention once again <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2019/05/united-kingdom-working-group-arbitrary-detention-expresses-concern-about-assange\">condemned the UK government</a> in 2019 for violating the freedoms and fundamental rights of the Australian journalist.</p>\n<p>In Belmarsh, Assange has been held in <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/julian-assange-solitary-confinement-human-rights-gavin-macfayden-award-344528\">solitary confinement for up to 23 hours per day</a>. UN legal experts have repeatedly stated that this kind of prolonged solitary confinement, which is routinely carried out by the United States and Britain, amounts to <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2020/02/united-states-prolonged-solitary-confinement-amounts-psychological-torture\">psychological torture</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, Julian Assange has been effectively imprisoned for a decade, has been subjected to grueling torture, and will likely spend the rest of his life in a US prison, all because he committed the “crime” of doing journalism.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>It is impossible to imagine a tyranny more absolute than this. With the Assange case, the United States is establishing a precedent that says it can imprison any journalist or really any person on Earth, regardless of their nationality, throw them in a dungeon for the rest of their life, and torture them. All Washington needs to do is fabricate charges and claim that that individual violated its domestic laws.</p>\n<p>Assange is not the only victim of this kind of Kafkaesque persecution by the US regime. The United States holds multiple political prisoners, including Black revolutionary journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal.</p>\n<p>Although it has less than 5% of the world’s population, the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration\">United States has nearly 25% of its prisoners</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>US censorship of media affects the entire world, not just North Americans</strong></h2>\n<p>In its May statement on <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/03/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-occasion-of-world-press-freedom-day-2022/\">World Press Freedom Day</a>, the Biden White House condemned Russia for passing “a ‘disinformation’ law intended to silence those speaking the truth.”</p>\n<p>The hypocrisy could hardly be any more ridiculous. The US government has used the canard of “disinformation” to censor news outlets and journalists from around the world, erasing their work and removing them from digital platforms.</p>\n<p>While Washington accuses Moscow of violating the freedom of speech inside Russia, US censorship harms the entire planet.</p>\n<p>In March, the US government forced YouTube to censor Russia’s major media network RT in every country on Earth. The European Union likewise banned Russian news outlets RT and Sputnik.</p>\n<p>Washington and Brussels insisted this draconian violation of the freedom of speech was necessary because Moscow was supposedly spreading “disinformation” about the war in Ukraine. Their own media outlets, meanwhile, have constantly been exposed for disseminating fake news and misleading propaganda to justify illegal Western wars of aggression – which explains why just <a href=\"https://multipolarista.com/2022/07/30/trust-us-media-war-propaganda/\">11% of North Americans trust television news</a>, and only 16% believe newspapers.</p>\n<p>YouTube’s censorship of Russian media outlets did not just affect people in North America and Europe, but rather the entire world. And YouTube is not just a private company; it is owned by Google, which is inextricably linked to the US government.</p>\n<p>All major <a href=\"https://yasha.substack.com/p/american-tech-giants-and-their-communication\">Silicon Valley companies</a> are US government contractors. Google, Facebook (which owns Instagram and WhatsApp), and Twitter have many billions of dollars of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/thousands-contracts-highlight-quiet-ties-between-big-tech-u-s-n1233171\">contracts with the US government agencies</a> such as the CIA, FBI, National Security Agency (NSA), Department of Defense, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as well as police departments.</p>\n<p>The US government uses Big Tech corporations in Silicon Valley as arms of soft power, censoring information that is inconvenient for its foreign-policy interests, violating the free speech of billions of people in foreign countries.</p>\n<p>This censorship is often directly overseen by veterans of the US national security state. Google and <a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/meet-ex-cia-agents-deciding-facebook-content-policy/281307/\">Facebook</a> have hired dozens of <a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/national-security-search-engine-google-ranks-cia-agents/281490/\">former CIA agents</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/censorship-way-facebook-hires-nato-press-officer-intelligence-chief/275154/\">NATO press officers</a>. Twitter has recruited many <a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/twitter-hiring-alarming-number-spooks-secret-agents/281114/\">former FBI officers</a>, and the top official overseeing Middle East-related content on Twitter is also a member of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/twitter-executive-also-part-time-officer-uk-army-psychological-warfare-unit\">British Army’s psychological warfare unit</a>, which admits to waging “information warfare.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2020/01/12/us-pressure-social-media-censoring-suspending-venezuela-iran-syria/\">Silicon Valley censorship</a> has silenced countless media outlets and journalists in China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, Syria, and other countries targeted by the US empire for destabilization</p>\n<p>Iranian media outlets have been constantly censored by the US government and its soft-power arms in Silicon Valley. The US Justice Department has even <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-seizes-27-additional-domain-names-used-iran-s-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps\">seized the domain names</a> of dozens of news websites that it alleged were being run by Iran and Yemen.</p>\n<p>Iran’s top network Press TV has had its social media accounts censored dozens of times. The US regime likewise robbed its domain name presstv.com.</p>\n<p><img class=\" wp-image-5625 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/multipolarista.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/presstvcom-domain-seized-US-government.png?resize=880%2C606&amp;ssl=1\" sizes=\"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/multipolarista.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/presstvcom-domain-seized-US-government.png?w=1216&amp;ssl=1 1216w, https://i0.wp.com/multipolarista.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/presstvcom-domain-seized-US-government.png?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/multipolarista.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/presstvcom-domain-seized-US-government.png?resize=1024%2C706&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/multipolarista.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/presstvcom-domain-seized-US-government.png?resize=768%2C529&amp;ssl=1 768w\" alt=\"presstvcom domain seized US government\" width=\"718\" height=\"495\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The US Justice Department seized Iran’s domain name presstv.com.</span></p>\n<p>This social media censorship nearly always serves US government interests.</p>\n<p>Just a week before Nicaragua’s elections in November 2021, Silicon Valley launches a coordinated <a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2021/11/02/facebook-twitter-purge-sandinista-nicaragua/\">purge of pro-Sandinista accounts on social media</a>.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of profiles on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook were censored. All of them were pro-Sandinista. Not a single account was from the US-backed right-wing opposition. On the contrary, Nicaraguans from the US-backed right-wing opposition are constantly promoted on social media, and verified while leftists are suspended.</p>\n<p>The same was clear in the US-led coup attempt against Venezuela. Representatives from Venezuela’s democratically elected government were suspended on Twitter, whereas US-appointed coup puppets like unelected putschist Juan Guaidó and his gang of corrupt cronies were all verified and promoted.</p>\n<p>While using vague allegations of “disinformation” to justify censoring these independent voices on social media, Silicon Valley corporations simultaneously <a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2020/08/10/twitter-us-state-media-ads-voa-persian/\">take money from US state media outlets</a> to run ads promoting propaganda against Washington’s adversaries.</p>\n<p>In addition to direct censorship through suspensions, there is also more subtle censorship by Silicon Valley mega-corporations.</p>\n<p>Google, for instance, distorts its algorithm in order to promote mainstream corporate media websites, and has a <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/09/google-news-blacklist-search-manipulation/\">blacklist of outlets</a> that it hides in search results. This means that independent media publications, especially left-wing and anti-imperialist pages, are severely hurt by the Google algorithm and get significantly less traffic.</p>\n<p>Even DuckDuckGo, which markets itself as a Google alternative that protects privacy, engages in this political censorship. After Russia initiated its special military operation in Ukraine in February 2022, the website announced that it would be <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/duck-duck-go-reverses-course-will-demote-russian-propaganda-in-search-results-014336389.html\">demoting in its search results</a> any websites that it accuses of being pro-Russian.</p>\n<h2><strong>While censoring independent journalists at home, US government funds so-called ‘independent journalists’ abroad to destabilize foreign adversaries</strong></h2>\n<p>While the United States persecutes journalists that expose its crimes and aggressively censors independent media outlets that operate inside its borders, Washington ironically claims to support “independent media” abroad.</p>\n<p>In its May statement on World Press Freedom Day, the Biden White House called for supporting so-called “independent media” in foreign countries.</p>\n<p>CIA cutouts like the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and National Endowment for Democracy (NED) have poured many <a href=\"https://multipolarista.com/2021/11/14/us-funded-nicaragua-media-fake-news/\">millions of dollars into bankrolling media activists</a> in countries where the United States seeks regime change.</p>\n<p>The US government claims it is supporting “civil society,” but in reality it is funding political opposition groups that use the media as a weapon to destabilize Washington’s adversaries.</p>\n<p>By definition, these media activists are not “independent” – they are receiving funding from the US government in order to advance its political interests. They are essentially indirect employees of the US State Department, and instruments of Washington’s soft power.</p>\n<p>These media activists constantly spread fake news, disinformation, and propaganda, and have played a <a href=\"https://thegrayzone.com/2021/06/12/coup-nicaragua-cpj-100-noticias/\">key role in violent coup attempts</a> in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bolivia, Hong Kong, Syria, Belarus, and beyond.</p>\n<p>The absurd hypocrisy of Washington persecuting independent journalists at home while funding them abroad highlights the deep cynicism of the US regime’s information warfare tactics.</p>\n<p>Washington may depict itself as the beacon of freedom and democracy, but its global empire is authoritarian and ruthless.</p>\n<p>US government repression impacts everyone on Earth. As long as the United States maintains its empire, and continues to try to control all of the planet’s political and economic affairs, no country, and no individual, can ever be completely safe.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

vaccinated and unvaccinated</strong></h2>\n<p>The CDC on Thursday issued <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-covid-19-guidelines-updated-recommendations/\">sweeping new recommendations</a> as part of the agency’s efforts to overhaul its <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0811-covid-guidance.html\">COVID-19 guidance</a>.</p>\n<p>“This guidance acknowledges that the pandemic is not over, but also helps us move to a point where COVID-19 no longer severely disrupts our daily lives,” the CDC’s Greta Massetti said in a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0811-covid-guidance.html\">press release</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-covid-19-guidelines-updated-recommendations/\">biggest changes</a> to the CDC’s guidance:</p>\n\nUnvaccinated people now have the same guidance as vaccinated people.\nThose who are exposed to the virus are no longer required to quarantine regardless of vaccination status.\nStudents may stay in class even if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19.\nSix-foot social distancing is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/health/virus-cdc-guidelines.html\">no longer recommended</a>.\nContact tracing and routine surveillance testing of symptomatic people are no longer recommended in most settings.\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/health/virus-cdc-guidelines.html\">The New York Times</a>, the CDC has been working for months on the new guidance which builds on previous guidance issued in February that reduced isolation times for those who get COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The agency said it is making changes to its guidance now because “vaccination and prior infections have granted many Americans some degree of protection against the virus, and treatments, vaccines and boosters are available to reduce the risk of severe illness.”</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/cdc-s-covid-19-guidance-changes-again\">The National Law Review</a>:</p>\n<p>“The CDC’s focus on individual responsibility, the removal of distinctions between vaccinated and unvaccinated, the removal of quarantine recommendations and the discussion of mask wearing as an individual responsibility are good news for employers who are considering relaxing COVID-19 workplace requirements.</p>\n<p>“This likely will not be the last we hear from the CDC on this topic. Indeed, the CDC stated that it intends to issue more specific guidance for settings such as healthcare, congregate living, and travel.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Pfizer vaccine efficacy in teens wanes 27 days after second dose</strong></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-covid-vaccine-adolescent-efficacy/\">study</a> published Aug. 8 in The Lancet showed the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine against symptomatic infection among adolescents “rapidly declined over time,” waning from just 27 days after the second dose.</p>\n<p>Researchers <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00451-0/fulltext?rss=yes\">analyzed data</a> from 503,776 COVID-19 tests of 2,948,538 adolescents — ages 12-17 — in Brazil from Sept. 2, 2021, to April 19, 2022, and 127,168 tests of 404,673 adolescents in Scotland from Aug. 6, 2021, to April 19, 2022.</p>\n<p>The study showed vaccine efficacy began to decline 27 days after the second dose for both countries, plummeting to 5.9% (95% CI 2.2–9.4) in Brazil and dropping to 50.6% (95% CI 42.7–57.4) in Scotland at 98 days after adolescents received the second dose.</p>\n<p>While protection against symptomatic COVID-19 dropped dramatically in both countries less than one month after the second dose, protection against severe illness — defined as hospitalization or death within 28 days — remained above 80% in Brazil from 28 days to 98 days and beyond.</p>\n<p>The authors <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-covid-vaccine-adolescent-efficacy/\">sought to assess protection</a> against severe illness in Scotland but were unable to do so because so few cases of severe COVID-19 in adolescents in Scotland were reported during the time of the study.</p>\n<p>The authors concluded that “two doses are insufficient to sustain protection against symptomatic disease” in adolescents and recommended more research be done on the need for <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/dr-paul-offit-covid-vaccine-mandate/\">booster doses</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>‘Stunning’ link between Pfizer vaccine and myocarditis in teens, study shows</strong></h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-covid-vaccine-myocarditis-teens-study/\">preprint study</a> conducted during Thailand’s national COVID-19 vaccination campaign showed what one physician described as a “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TracyBethHoeg/status/1557039855304990721\">stunning</a>” association between myocarditis and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.</p>\n<p>The study analyzed 301 participants ages 13-18 who were healthy and without abnormal symptoms after receiving their first vaccine dose. Participants with a history of cardiomyopathy, tuberculous pericarditis or constrictive pericarditis and severe allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine were excluded from the study.</p>\n<p>Researchers found that 18% of the 301 teens analyzed had an abnormal electrocardiogram, or EKG after receiving their second dose of Pfizer, 3.5% of males developed myopericarditis or <a href=\"https://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/research-and-grants/faqs/types-of-myocarditis/\">subclinical myocarditis</a>, two were hospitalized and one was admitted to the ICU for heart problems.</p>\n<p>Cardiovascular adverse events observed during the study included tachycardia (7.64%), shortness of breath (6.64%), palpitation (4.32%), chest pain (4.32%) and hypertension (3.99%).</p>\n<p>Fifty-four adolescents had abnormal electrocardiograms after vaccination, three patients had minimal <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pericardial-effusion/symptoms-causes/syc-20353720#:~:text=Pericardial%20effusion%20(per%2De%2D,a%20thin%20layer%20of%20fluid.\">pericardial effusion</a> with findings compatible with subacute myopericarditis and six patients experienced <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mitral-valve-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20355446#:~:text=Mitral%20valve%20prolapse%20is%20a,the%20heart%20squeezes%20(contracts).\">mitral valve prolapse</a>.</p>\n<p>All patients were male and had abnormal electrocardiograms, particularly sinus tachycardia. <a href=\"http://childrenshealthdefense/\">Researchers said</a> the clinical course was mild in all cases.</p>\n<h2><strong>Military using ‘Comirnaty’ vaccine produced at facility not approved by FDA</strong></h2>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/whistleblowers-coast-guard-military-pfizer-comirnaty-vaccine-fda/\">exclusive interview</a> with The Defender, a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) service member alleged the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) is administering COVID-19 vaccines from vials of <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/childrens-health-defense-sues-fda-pfizer-comirnaty-covid-vaccine/\">Pfizer’s Comirnaty-labeled vaccines</a> that are not produced in a facility approved by the FDA.</p>\n<p>Lt.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) under penalty of perjury, detailed his personal investigation into the availability and origin of Comirnaty-labeled COVID-19 vaccine vials at U.S. military facilities.</p>\n<p>Coppin relayed his concerns in an interview with <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/\">The Defender</a>, as did Holly Freincle, the wife of a U.S. military service member stationed at Fort Detrick, Maryland, who corroborated Coppin’s claims that Comirnaty-labeled vaccine vials are appearing at military service facilities.</p>\n<p>Until now, the DOD has claimed the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, administered under <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine\">Emergency Use Authorization</a>, is “<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/judge-allen-winsor-pfizer-eua-comirnaty-vaccines-interchangeable/\">interchangeable</a>” with the fully licensed Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine — which until recently, was said to be unavailable at military facilities.</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/LT_Coppin_Declaration_30JUL221.pdf\">July 30 declaration</a>, Coppin, who has served with the USCG since March 2002, reported that after a long period of unavailability, the “Comirnaty” vaccine began to appear at U.S. military facilities in June.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

Zawahiri.”</p>\n<p>No doubt, this is a very carefully worded Russian statement that focuses on <strong>the reliability of Biden’s version.</strong> <strong>Indeed, Biden got away scot-free since he made the announcement from the White House without taking any questions from the media.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p>Nechayev pointed out that <strong>“Washington has not provided the public with any evidence of the elimination of this terrorist.”</strong> And he merely took note of media reports that the apartment building hit by the Americans in Kabul belonged to the “Haqqani clan”.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>However, curiously, Nechayev offered that some “first conclusions can be drawn” on the basis of the official comments of the authorities in Kabul — namely, <strong>“that they have no information about A. Zawahiri’s stay in the Afghan capital.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p>Russia has traditionally kept a robust intelligence system working on Afghanistan providing real time inputs to Moscow, including during the Taliban rule from 1996-2001, when the Russian embassy and consulates remained closed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>In fact, Russian sources were far ahead of others in sharing the details of former Ashraf Ghani’s hasty evacuation from Kabul on August 15 last year amidst the chaotic arrival of the Taliban in the city. (Ghani apparently chose to keep even his hand-picked vice-president and super spy Amrullah Saleh in the dark that he was fleeing with his wife and then national security advisor Hamdullah Mohib.)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Therefore, it is a reasonable surmise that Nechayev probably spoke on what security experts would call a “need-to-know” basis. That makes his remarks doubting the authenticity of Biden’s remarks truly astounding. It is as good as saying that Moscow has received conflicting reports! (Interestingly, <a href=\"https://tass.com/politics/1492403\">Tass highlighted</a> Nechayev’s remarks in a special report yesterday.)<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>However, Nechayev plunged the knife deep and raised some very pertinent questions in this strange case of a murder without evidence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>He commented that “such aggressive actions of the US Air Force, which invaded the sovereign territory of Afghanistan, raise a number of serious questions.” Nechayev posed two questions: “For example, who provided the airspace for the airstrike on Kabul? Who will be responsible in case of collateral civilian casualties during such actions?”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>They are indeed big questions. Afghanistan shares its borders with only six countries — Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, China and Pakistan. It is a safe bet that Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and China wouldn’t have got involved in such a murderous act by the Americans in violation of international law and UN Charter. As for Tajikistan, its airspace is under Russian control. That leaves Pakistan as the only plausible culprit here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Perhaps, Biden Administration refuses to provide “evidence” for fear it might put Rawalpindi in a tight spot at a time when the incumbent army chief is a strategic asset for Washington? There are no easy answers. All we know is that the present army chief Gen. Bajwa is known to take a hands-on role in all major issues and most minor issues in Pakistan-US relations.</p>\n<p>He even reached out to <strong>Wendy Sherman</strong>, the US Deputy Secretary of State, with a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/pakistan-military-chief-seeks-us-help-on-release-of-imf-loan/2022/07/30/3dd8c35a-1040-11ed-88e8-c58dc3dbaee2_story.html\">request seeking her intervention</a> with the IMF to release the pending tranche of financial bail-out for Pakistan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Significantly, Nechayev alluded to “attempts to use a real threat to cover up their (US’) own geopolitical ambitions.” He concluded: “Washington, judging by this incident, prefers to act as it pleases, following strictly in line with its foreign policy benefits, regardless of international law and the national sovereignty of other states.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>What could be the “foreign policy benefits” here? There are three ways to look at the question. First and foremost, Biden burnishes his image as a decisive leader when his incoherent public behaviour on numerous occasions lately came to be widely noticed within the US and abroad. Indeed, Biden’s August 1 remarks were peppered with large dollops of self-praise taking credit for the decapitation of the dreaded al-Qaeda.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> He projected himself as a “hands-on” president. </span></p>\n<p>Second, the US has created a precedent by this act of July 31 — underscoring its prerogative to act as it chooses on Afghanistan. Simply put, the Rubicon has been crossed and the US military might has “returned” to Afghanistan, now that Washington claims that al-Qaeda is very much active in Afghanistan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Of course, it is a humiliating blow for the Taliban whose two-decade long “resistance” was all about regaining Afghanistan’s sovereignty. Furthermore, the door has been firmly shut on any US-Taliban engagement for a foreseeable future, now that Washington doesn’t have to look beyond that to allege a continuing Taliban-al Qaeda nexus.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Logically, the US can even justify joining hands henceforth with the UK (and France) to extend support to the Panjshiris’ armed rebellion against the Taliban. The Taliban faces a pincer move from Pakistani military and the Biden Administration at a time when, ironically, its best supporter, Imran Khan, is also being defanged systematically in a nutcracker by the civilian government in Islamabad and the so-called “powers that be.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Of course, keeping Afghanistan in turmoil would serve the US and Nato interests at the present juncture when Russia, the provider of security for Central Asia, is preoccupied with the Ukraine conflict, and China is brooding over Taiwan’s reunification. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Third, the timing: Biden struck when only about 24 hrs were left for House Speaker Nancy policy’s plane to descend on Taipei. <strong>The fiction that Washington propagated to the effect that the Administration had no control over the Speaker had, ironically, boomeranged, casting Biden in a poor light as a commander-in-chief who could not even order a military plane to change direction. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p>Suffice to say, the theatrics of the July 31 airstrike in Kabul momentarily at least distracted attention from the miserable picture Biden drew for himself as a weak, ineffectual POTUS.</p>\n<p>The most interesting part is that alongside Nechayev’s remarks in Moscow, the Russian embassy in Washington has since voiced support for a group of more than 70 economists from the United States and other countries with a call to unfreeze all international reserves of the Central Bank of Afghanistan, in an August 10 <a href=\"https://cepr.net/\">appeal published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research</a>, Europe’s leading network of Economic Policy Researchers.</p>\n<p>The Russian embassy says: “We fully support this appeal. Considering unacceptable the situation in which the American authorities illegally withhold financial resources belonging to the Afghan people. At the same time, we believe that their bargaining with Kabul regarding the conditions for allocating half of the amount to it is cynical … Washington’s actions are exacerbating the suffering of innocent Afghans…”</p>\n<p>Moscow implies that the alibi of an alleged Taliban-al Qaeda nexus to block the engagement with the Taliban by the regional states is unacceptable. In sum, Russia rejects the American version of the murder in Kabul as substantiating anything.</p>\n<p>All in all, this indeed becomes “a perfect murder”, worthy of being a sequel to the Michael Douglas-Gwyneth Paltrow crime thriller on a murder that left no clue to trace the perpetrators. By the way, the pleasurable 1998 film also had two alternate endings on the original Blu-ray disc release.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> The viewer was at liberty to choose which version was found more agreeable. </span></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

After the CIA drone strike killed Zawahiri on August 2, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/\">Biden declared</a>, “People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer.” What we should fear instead is the dangerous precedent set by Biden’s unlawful extrajudicial execution.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to being illegal, the killing of Zawahiri also occurred in a moment when the United Nations had already determined that people in the U.S. had little to fear from him. As a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/al-qaeda-terrorism-isis.html\">United Nations report released in July</a> concluded, “Al Qaeda is not viewed as posing an immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan because it lacks an external operational capability and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.”</p>\n<p>Just as former president Barack Obama stated that “<a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-dead\">Justice has been done</a>” after he assassinated <strong>Osama bin Laden</strong>, Biden said, “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/\">Now justice has been delivered</a>” when he announced the assassination of Zawahiri.</p>\n<p>Retaliation, however, does not constitute justice.</p>\n<p>Targeted, or political, assassinations are extrajudicial executions. They are deliberate and unlawful killings meted out by order of, or with acquiescence of, a government. Extrajudicial executions are implemented outside a judicial framework.</p>\n<p>The fact that Zawahiri did not pose an imminent threat is precisely why his assassination was illegal.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zawahiri’s Assassination Violated International Law</strong></h2>\n<p>Extrajudicial executions are prohibited by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States has ratified, making it part of U.S. law under the Constitution’s supremacy clause. <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights\">Article 6 of the ICCPR</a> states, “Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.” In its interpretation of Article 6, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/CCPR/GCArticle6/GCArticle6_EN.pdf\">The UN Human Rights Committee opined</a> that all human beings are entitled to the protection of the right to life “without distinction of any kind, including for persons suspected or convicted of even the most serious crimes.”</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>“Outside the context of active hostilities, the use of drones or other means for targeted killing is almost never likely to be legal,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AgnesCallamard/status/1212918159096864768\">tweeted</a>Agnès Callamard, UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. “Intentionally lethal or potentially lethal force can only be used where strictly necessary to protect against an imminent threat to life.” In order to be lawful, the United States would need to demonstrate that the target “constituted an imminent threat to others,” Callamard said.</p>\n<p>Moreover, willful killing is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions, punishable as a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act. A targeted killing is lawful only when deemed necessary to protect life, and no other means (including apprehension or nonlethal incapacitation) is available to protect life.</p>\n<h2><strong>Zawahiri’s Assassination Violated U.S. Law</strong></h2>\n<p>The drone strike that killed Zawahiri also violated the <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp\">War Powers Resolution</a>, which lists three situations in which the president can introduce U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities:</p>\n<p>First, pursuant to a congressional declaration of war, which has not occurred since World War II. Second, in “a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.” (Zawahiri’s presence in Afghanistan more than 20 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks did not constitute a “national emergency.”) Third, when there is “specific statutory authorization,” such as an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).</p>\n<p>In 2001, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf\">Congress adopted an AUMF</a> that authorized the president to use military force against individuals, groups and countries that had contributed to the 9/11 attacks “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.”</p>\n<p>Zawahiri was one of a small circle of people widely believed to have planned the 2001 hijacking of four airplanes, three of which were flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center buildings. But since he did not pose “an immediate international threat” before the U.S. targeted him for assassination, he should have been arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>The attack against Zawahiri violated Obama’s targeting rules, which required that the target pose a “<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/presidential_policy_guidance.pdf\">continuing imminent threat.</a>” Although <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Donald Trump relaxed </a><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/foia-document/psp-foia-document-april-30-2021\">Obama’s rules</a>, Biden is conducting <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/biden-drones.html\">a secret review</a>to establish his own standards for targeting killing.</p>\n<h2><strong>Biden Continues to Launch Illegal Drone Strikes</strong></h2>\n<p>In spite of the Biden administration’s claim that no civilians were killed during the strike on Zawahiri, there has been no independent evidence to support that assertion.</p>\n<p>The assassination of Zawahiri came nearly a year after <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/war-in-afghanistan-isnt-over-its-taking-the-form-of-illegal-drone-strikes/\">Biden launched an illegal strike</a> as he withdrew U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Ten civilians were killed in that attack. The U.S. Central Command admitted the strike was “a tragic mistake” after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">an extensive </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\"><em>New York Times </em></a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/world/asia/us-air-strike-drone-kabul-afghanistan-isis.html\">investigation </a>put a lie to the prior U.S. declaration that it was a “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afghanistan-drone-strike-mistake-civilians-killed-pentagon/\">righteous strike</a>.”</p>\n<p>Biden declared that although he was withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan, he would mount “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/us/politics/cia-afghanistan.html\">over-the-horizon</a>” attacks from outside the country even without troops on the ground. We can expect the Biden administration to conduct future illegal drone strikes that kill civilians.</p>\n<p>The 2001 AUMF has been used to justify <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2022/8/3/23289167/zawahiri-war-terror-afghanistan-us-biden\">U.S. military actions in 85 countries</a>. Congress must repeal it and replace it with a new AUMF specifically requiring that any use of force comply with U.S. obligations under international law.</p>\n<p>In addition, Congress should revisit the War Powers Resolution and explicitly limit the president’s authority to use force to that which is necessary to repel a sudden or imminent attack.</p>\n<p>Finally, the United States must end its “global war on terror” once and for all. Drone strikes terrorize and kill countless civilians and make us more vulnerable to terrorism.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

The number of Rukban residents has shrunk from about 70,000 to less than 10,000, most of whom have returned to their cities.</p>\n<p>The dismantling of the Rukban camp has become more than a humanitarian and political necessity, a step that will end the suffering of more than 1,400 families and withdraws a blackmail card from the hands of the Americans that they use whenever they want against Damascus and its allies.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Muhammad Al-Khidr</strong> – Damascus, Al-Mayadeen.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>There is an obligation on the citizens of the USA and the European Union toward these innocent people held in such horrific conditions, especially the taxpayers in the west who foot the bills of the US forces and their proxy terrorists imposing such hardship on those people, don’t just wait for the elections every several years and then vote for the different side of the coins, take to the streets and demand the release of these civilians, imagine the same is happening to your family while their captors are claiming they’re protecting them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

More than a quarter of them have taken place since the end of the Cold War.</em></p>\n<p>The United States has carried out</p>\n\n34 percent of its 392 interventions against countries in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n23 percent in East Asia and the Pacific region;\n14 percent in the Middle East and North Africa;\nand just 13 percent in Europe and Central Asia, according to a newly refined version of the <a href=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/css/mip-research/\">Military Intervention Project (MIP)</a> dataset — a venture of the Center for Strategic Studies at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n\n<p>In addition to providing the most accurate count ever of U.S. military interventions — doubling the number of cases found in existing data, while also employing rigorous sourcing methods — the MIP offers 200 variables that allow for complex analyses of drivers and outcomes of wars and other uses of force.</p>\n<p>Crucially, Kushi and Toft, the director of the Fletcher School’s Center for Strategic Studies, found that U.S. interventions have “increased and intensified” in recent years. While the Cold War era (1946–1989) and the period between 1868–1917 were the most “militaristically active” for the United States, the post-9/11 era has already assumed third position in all of U.S. history.</p>\n<div data-widget-id=\"rel_89-4\"> </div>\n<p>Unlike earlier eras in which displays and threats of force were employed, such posturing short of military violence has been absent in recent years. The United States, they found, has actually “engaged in 30 interventions at level 4 (usage of force) or 5 (war).”</p>\n<p>Until the end of the Cold War, note Kushi and Toft, U.S. military hostility was generally proportional to that of its rivals.  Since then, “the U.S. began to escalate its hostilities as its rivals deescalate it, marking the beginning of America’s more kinetic foreign policy.”  This recent pattern of international relations conducted largely through armed force, what Toft has termed “<a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2018/05/the-dangerous-rise-of-kinetic-diplomacy/\">kinetic diplomacy</a>,” has increasingly targeted the Middle East and Africa.  These regions have seen both large-scale U.S. wars, as in Afghanistan and Iraq, and low-profile combat in nations such as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/magazine/burkina-faso-terrorism-united-states.html\">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/03/09/cameroon-military-abuses-bir-127e/\">Cameroon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/revealed-the-us-militarys-36-codenamed-operations-in-africa-090000841.html\">the Central African Republic, Chad</a>, and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/07/01/pentagon-127e-proxy-wars/\">Tunisia</a>.</p>\n<p>The MIP data incorporates confirmed covert operations and low-profile interventions by Special Operations forces, but a combination of U.S. government secrecy and the dataset’s scrupulous sourcing standards guarantees that post-9/11 tally is an undercount, according to Kushi, an assistant professor of Political Science at Bridgewater State University and a non-residential fellow at Tufts’ Center for Strategic Studies.</p>\n<p>Recently, for example, Alice Speri and I revealed the existence of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/07/01/pentagon-127e-proxy-wars/\">low-profile proxy war programs</a> run across Africa, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>\n<p>While experts say that the Pentagon has likely used the secretive 127e authority to carry out combat beyond the scope of any authorization for use of military force or permissible self-defense, in violation of the Constitution, such highly classified operations may evade capture in the MIP dataset.  While 127e programs in Somalia and Yemen for example overlap with known U.S. military interventions, other uses of the authority, such as in Egypt and Lebanon, may not.</p>\n<p>The same goes for even lesser-known authorities like <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/08/houses-irregular-warfare-provision-risks-unintended-war/375178/\">Section 1202</a>, which provides support to foreign irregular forces aimed at near-peer competitors.</p>\n<p>As the MIP is further developed and refined, Kushi and Toft hope that it will allow for a more nuanced understanding of the conditions that cause the United States to launch military interventions and the effects on the U.S. and the nations it targets, including the economic and human toll and inadvertent outcomes.</p>\n<p>What, they ask, “were the longer-term costs and unintended consequences of the intervention in Afghanistan and how did that intervention influence U.S. engagements in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen?”  The answers, they hope, will lead to improved data and, ultimately, a better U.S. foreign policy.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.

In April 2022, a British judge ordered Assange extradited to the US to face up to 175 years in prison for publishing truthful information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The US has indicted Assange under the Espionage Act, even though he published the same information as did the New York Times and Washington Post.</p>\n<p>Researcher Mark Weisbrot explained in 2017, “<a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/04/12/julian-assange-political-prisoner-who-has-exposed-government-crimes-and-atrocities\">Julian Assange is a political prisoner</a>. … His crime, and that of WikiLeaks, has been the practice of journalism, and particularly in defense of human rights and civil liberties. … Assange and WikiLeaks’ real offense was to expose the crimes of the most powerful people in the world.”</p>\n<p>Extraditing Assange, a journalist and Australian citizen, to the United States would have even more <a href=\"https://multipolarista.com/2022/08/08/us-worst-violator-freedom-press/\">negative repercussions for our present remnants of free press</a> and democratic rights. No case better embodies the old <a href=\"https://depts.washington.edu/iww/justice_dept.shtml\">IWW banner for “class war prisoners”</a>: “Remember!

He was sentenced to 45 months for releasing documents showing US military drone strikes in Afghanistan largely killed innocent people. Hale participated in the drone program while in the Air Force and NSA from 2009 to 2013, and later became an outspoken critic and a defender of whistle blowers.</p>\n<p>Hale is believed to have been the source material for <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/\">The Drone Papers</a>. The documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZNVN-qI7E\">National Bird</a> documents whistleblowers in the US drone assassination program. For his truth-telling, Hale received the Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence and the Blueprint for Free Speech International Whistleblowing Prize. <a href=\"https://popularresistance.org/when-the-just-go-to-prison/\">Chris Hedges</a> has written about his case.</p>\n<p><strong>Joshua Schulte</strong>, a former hacker employed by the CIA, was blamed for releasing two billion pages of secret CIA data, known as Vault 7, to WikiLeaks.

If you exercise your right to defend yourself, and your people, from the oppressive arm of the state, they make you into an outlaw, and hunt you down.”</p>\n<p>The FBI said it goals in COINTELPRO were to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize,” adding that “no opportunity must be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques … for maximum effectiveness … and a final goal should be to prevent the long range growth of militant black organizations, especially among youth.”</p>\n<p>This police state operation against Black liberation resulted in at least 38 Black Panther Party members being killed, including <strong>Fred Hampton</strong> and <strong>Mark Clark</strong>, with hundreds more imprisoned on frame-up charges for their armed self-defense actions, several for more than 45 years.</p>\n<p>The website <a href=\"http://www.sekouodinga.com/captured-heroes.html\">Members of the Black Panther Party Still Imprisoned</a> registered the number incarcerated in 2014, although several have died since then.

Environmental “Green Scare” protestors</strong></h2>\n<p>A number of environmental activists, animal rights supporters, and water protectors have challenged corporate abuses and have been jailed.</p>\n<p>During the original so-called <a href=\"https://progressive.org/magazine/the-new-green-scare-king-191001/\">Green Scare</a>, in the 1990s to early 2000s, the <a href=\"https://propertyofthepeople.org/projects/green-scare-animal-rights/\">US government sought to squash</a> animal rights and environmental activism, acting in the interest of corporations that profit from damaging the earth.</p>\n<p>A more recent series of jailings have specifically targeted people protesting against pipeline construction.</p>\n<p>The following are political prisoners:</p>\n<p><strong>Joseph Mahmoud Dibee</strong>, a member of Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front was arrested in 2018 for his participation in setting fire to a slaughterhouse. Between 1995 and 2001, a group of Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front supporters caused more than $45 million in damages in a series of arsons. Dibee is imprisoned awaiting sentencing.</p>\n<p><strong>Marius Mason</strong> (formerly Marie Mason), a member of the Earth Liberation Front, was <a href=\"https://supportmariusmason.org/\">arrested in 2008</a> for an attack on a lab building at Michigan State University that was creating genetically modified organisms, with funding from mega-corporation Monsanto, the producer of Agent Orange.</p>\n<p>Mason was also sentenced for damage to commercial logging equipment. No one was harmed by these actions. Mason’s 22 year-sentence is the longest yet for any of the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090228035158/http:/www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/green-scare\">Green Scare cases</a> of those committing crimes against property of corporations.</p>\n<p><strong>Jessica Reznicek</strong>, of the Catholic Workers Movement, <a href=\"http://supportjessicareznicek.com/\">took action in 2016</a> to stop the environmentally destructive Dakota Access Pipeline by dismantling construction equipment and pipeline valves and setting fire to construction machinery. She would have been handed three years, but was sentenced to eight, with the added sentence for terrorism, even though no person was physically harmed.</p>\n<p>Reznicek’s actions against private property were “calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government,” meaning a person who takes direct action against an energy company can be treated as an enemy of the state. Reznicek explained, “What we did do was fight a private corporation that has run rampant across our country seizing land and polluting our nation’s water supply.”</p>\n<h2><strong>The United States government has political prisoners</strong></h2>\n<p>This list belies the myth that the United States has no political prisoners.</p>\n<p>Political prisoners have no shared ideology. Standing for justice does not necessarily mean that one defends their political views; it means that one demands their freedom because they have been unjustly incarcerated.</p>\n<p>Many hundreds of thousands of people have been unjustly incarcerated in the United States, but in these cases, it is clear that they were detained because of their political beliefs and activism, and that by definition makes them political prisoners.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Note to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
