But there’s new information that hasn’t been widely reported. A sizable segment of the research community has formed the same opinion as Dr. Redfield: that Covid-19 leaked from experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. </p>\n<p><em>Jamie Metzl, World Health Organization International Advisory Committee on Human Genome Editing: “There are scientists all around the world who have told me that they believe the most likely origin of COVID-19, of the pandemic, is an accidental lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”</em></p>\n<p>Jamie Metzl is a member of the World Health Organization International Advisory Committee on Human Genome Editing.</p>\n<p class=\"has-background\"><em>Additional info</em>: <strong>About Jamie Metzl</strong>: Metzl served as Deputy Staff Director of the Foreign Relations Committee under then-Sen. Joe Biden (2001-2003); on the National Security Council (1997-99); and at the State Department (1999-01) under President Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p><em>Sharyl (to Metzl): “What have you been told, and what have you found about scientists who feel like they can\'t step forward?”</em></p>\n<p><em>Metzl: “Many of these people are afraid to step forward. They\'ve called it career suicide, because there are so many contentious issues, because the stakes are so high. Because the Chinese government, in collaboration, or conjunction, or maybe not even association, but with some very high-level and prominent scientists have put forward this story that I think is wrong.”</em></p>\n<p>Two scientists with knowledge of the matter told me the U.S. government conducted genome sequencing almost immediately in the pandemic. Among other things, they say Covid-19 shows clear hallmarks of man’s intervention. </p>\n<p>French virologist Luc Montagnier, a Nobel Prize recipient, arrived at the same conclusion a year ago. He says Covid-19’s genetics reveal “manipulation.” “Someone added sequences,” he said. “It’s the work of professionals, of molecular biologists…a very meticulous work.”</p>\n<p class=\"has-background\"><em>Additional info</em>: <strong>Analysis saying Covid-19 is lab-derived</strong>: Dr. Stephen Quay, M.D., PhD., CEO of Atossa Therapeutics <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-dr-steven-quay-concludes-130000526.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">conducted</a> a Bayesian analysis that he says <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/4477212#.YITGNi1h2Rs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">concluded</a> beyond a reasonable doubt that Covid-19 is lab-derived.</p>\n<p>Genetic analysis alone isn’t 100% conclusive, because results must be compared to viruses from the Wuhan lab. And sources confirm: “We never got the sample from China.” </p>\n<p>But scientists who spoke with me say genome sequencing, coupled with what’s known about research conducted by a U.S.-Chinese partnership, leaves them with little doubt that Covid-19 is a product of experiments.</p>\n<p>The scientists I talked to don’t want to be quoted by name for fear of repercussions in today’s politically-charged environment. They\'re highly critical that a U.S. research collaboration was allowed with China— a communist nation that has an active bioweapons program and, is arguably, our biggest world competitor and foe.</p>\n<p>Scientists from the U.S. and the Wuhan lab joined up on experiments that involved making bat coronavirus more infectious, to try to invent a vaccine.</p>\n<p>It’s called “gain of function” research, and it’s controversial because it could create a lethal virus that escapes and causes a pandemic. So risky, the U.S. temporarily <a href=\"http://moratorium%20on%20gof/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">halted</a> such studies in 2014.</p>\n<p>But an exception was made.

After receiving political backlash for the cancelled funding, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reinstated the grant, but made China receiving additional funds contingent upon WIV answering questions about the lab\'s practices and the Covid-19 outbreak; and providing a virus sample. EcoHealth Alliance <a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/2020/08/statement-on-the-latest-development-regarding-ecohealth-alliances-coronavirus-research-funding\">criticized</a> the conditions saying it made the research “impossible.\" On Aug. 27, 2020, it was <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/27/nih-awards-grant-to-ecohealth-alliance-months-after-uproar-over-political-interference/\">announced</a> that the National Institutes of Health had awarded an even larger grant of taxpayer money, $7.5 million, to EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth Alliance is now reportedly one of 11 institutions and research teams approved to receive part of an $82 million bundle of U.S. tax money to study viruses crossing from nature into people, and rapid response strategies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Clean-Transcript\">Clean-Transcript:</h4>\n<p>When the former head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Robert Redfield, recently said Covid-19 likely leaked from a Chinese research lab, news headlines called it “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/medical-advances/545106-trumps-cdc-director-makes-shocking-statement\">shocking</a>.\" </p>\n<p>Dr. Robert Redfield on CNN: “I still think the most likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory— you know, escaped.”</p>\n<p>That was followed by a flurry of <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dr-fauci-disputes-trump-cdc-directors-covid-lab-escape-theory-210220298.htmlhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/health/lab-leak-coronavirus-theory-comic-book-scn/index.html\">media reports</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/health/lab-leak-coronavirus-theory-comic-book-scn/index.html\">ridiculing</a> the notion; insisting that Covid-19 probably jumped from bats to people through an unexplained, natural route. But there’s new information that hasn’t been widely reported. A sizable segment of the research community has formed the same opinion as Dr. Redfield: that Covid-19 leaked from experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. </p>\n<p>Jamie Metzl, World Health Organization International Advisory Committee on Human Genome Editing: “There are scientists all around the world who have told me that they believe the most likely origin of COVID-19, of the pandemic, is an accidental lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”</p>\n<p>Jamie Metzl is a member of the World Health Organization International Advisory Committee on Human Genome Editing.</p>\n<p>Sharyl (to Metzl): “What have you been told, and what have you found about scientists who feel like they can\'t step forward?”</p>\n<p>Metzl: “Many of these people are afraid to step forward. They\'ve called it career suicide, because there are so many contentious issues, because the stakes are so high. Because the Chinese government, in collaboration, or conjunction, or maybe not even association, but with some very high-level and prominent scientists have put forward this story that I think is wrong.”</p>\n<p>Two scientists with knowledge of the matter told me the U.S. government conducted genome sequencing almost immediately in the pandemic. Among other things, they say Covid-19 shows clear hallmarks of man’s intervention. </p>\n<p>French virologist Luc Montagnier, a Nobel Prize recipient, arrived at the same conclusion a year ago. He says Covid-19’s genetics reveal “manipulation.” “Someone added sequences,” he said. “It’s the work of professionals, of molecular biologists…a very meticulous work.”</p>\n<p>Genetic analysis alone isn’t 100% conclusive, because results must be compared to viruses from the Wuhan lab. And sources confirm: “We never got the sample from China.” </p>\n<p>But scientists who spoke with me say genome sequencing, coupled with what’s known about research conducted by a U.S.-Chinese partnership, leaves them with little doubt that Covid-19 is a product of experiments.</p>\n<p>The scientists I talked to don’t want to be quoted by name for fear of repercussions in today’s politically-charged environment. They\'re highly critical that a U.S. research collaboration was allowed with China— a communist nation that has an active bioweapons program and, is arguably, our biggest world competitor and foe.</p>\n<p>Scientists from the U.S. and the Wuhan lab joined up on experiments that involved making bat coronavirus more infectious, to try to invent a vaccine.</p>\n<p>It’s called “gain of function” research, and it’s controversial because it could create a lethal virus that escapes and causes a pandemic. So risky, the U.S. temporarily <a href=\"http://moratorium%20on%20gof/\">halted</a> such studies in 2014.</p>\n<p>But an exception was made. The “gain of function” research underway by the U.S. and Wuhan scientists was “reviewed and approved for continued study by [the National Institutes of Health.]” or “NIH.” </p>\n<p>NIH didn’t only approve the research, it paid for it with six grants of tax dollars, including from the “National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,” led by Dr. Anthony Fauci.</p>\n<p>More taxpayer money from Fauci\'s institute and the U.S. Agency for International Development was funneled to the coronavirus research with China through <a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/\">EcoHealth Alliance</a>, a New York based nonprofit led by Peter Daszak, a zoologist who specializes in viruses transmitted from animals to people.</p>\n<p>Also working on the research, <a href=\"https://www.med.unc.edu/microimm/directory/ralph-baric-phd-1/\">Ralph Baric</a> at the University of North Carolina. His work centered on <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/100/22/12995\">genetically manipulating</a> coronavirus in part to allow for “rapid and rational development…[of]…vaccines and therapeutics.”</p>\n<p>Together, they teamed up with the renowned Chinese virologist nicknamed “bat woman,” at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhingli. They engineered genetic hybrids of bat coronaviruses, successfully getting them to infect human airway cells grafted in mice. </p>\n<p>Peter Daszak, EcoHealth Alliance: “You can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily…”</p>\n<p>Daszak talked about the collaboration in this <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4104828\">interview</a> just before the Covid-19 outbreak. He said the team’s research was designed to stop coronavirus from crossing into people, and to help develop a vaccine for the resulting illness: SARS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdYDL_RK--w\">Peter Daszak</a>: “The logical progression for vaccines is, if you’re going to develop a vaccine for SARS, people are going to use Pandemic SARS, but let’s try to insert some of these related, and get a better vaccine.”</p>\n<p>As far back as 2015, numerous independent scientists <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/engineered-bat-virus-stirs-debate-over-risky-research-1.18787\">objected</a> to the “gain of function” research with China. In a published paper, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (Simon Wain-Hobson) noted the research had produced an engineered novel coronavirus that “grows remarkably well” in human cells and “If the virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory.” A biodefense expert (Richard Ebright, Molecular biologist, Rutgers University) added: “The only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk.”</p>\n<p>In 2018, the year before China\'s outbreak, U.S. State Department science diplomats visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology. They said the research conducted on bat coronaviruses was critically important. But they were so concerned about safety issues at the lab, they dispatched sensitive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/\">cables</a> to Washington D.C. warning that the work posed a possible risk of a new SARS-like pandemic. Josh Rogin at the Washington Post later obtained and published the cables.</p>\n<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci: “Obviously, there are a number of theories…”</p>\n<p>For his part, Fauci responded to Redfield’s opinion— that Covid-19 escaped from the Wuhan lab— without addressing his agency’s funding of research at issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4954445/dr-fauci-responds-cdc-directors-claim-virus-wuhan-lab\">Dr. Anthony Fauci</a>: “So Dr. Redfield was mentioning that he was giving an opinion as to a possibility. But again there are other alternatives, others that most people hold by.”</p>\n<p>Fauci declined our interview request. So did Baric, the researcher at the University of North Carolina as did Daszak— the researcher who leads EcoHealth Alliance. On Twitter, Daszak called the idea that Covid-19 links to his research— “rabbit hole conspiracies.”</p>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterDaszak/status/1377117613822668801?s=20\">The same gang</a> of right wing media outlets are also posting fraudulent claims about my work,” Daszak tweeted. “Pure politics w/out a care for how this ultimately puts public health at risk.”</p>\n<p>Despite Daszak’s research partnership with Wuhan lab scientists, the World Health Organization raised eyebrows by inviting him to help investigate the origins of Covid-19.

('55', '428', 'What I Just Told The New York Times About the Complete Failure and Disaster of the COVID-19 Vaccine', 'what-i-just-told-the-new-york-times-about-the-complete-failure-and-disaster-of-the-covid-19-vaccine', '<p>Earlier this week, I received this email from the New York Times: \"Hello Mr. Root, I am a media reporter with The New York Times. My colleague and I are working on a story about false or misleading vaccine misinformation in the audio space ...</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p>You have said on Facebook that the vaccine \'doesn\'t work\' and is \'a complete failure.\' Do you have any comment?\"</p>\r\n<p>I want to share my response to The New York Times:</p>\r\n<p>Sure, I have a comment. Every word I say is based on science and facts.</p>\r\n<p>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is the only present scientific way of measuring deaths and injuries from any vaccine — including the COVID-19 vaccine. It\'s not my system. It\'s not based on politics. It has nothing to do with conservative or liberal opinions.</p>\r\n<p>It is a science-based medical reporting system provided by the government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\r\n<p>It is the only way of keeping track of deaths, crippling injuries and adverse reactions from any vaccine. It has been used for many decades.</p>\r\n<p>No one in the medical community or media has EVER in history ignored or disparaged VAERS before — until now.</p>\r\n<p>Here are the VAERS numbers: Over 17,000 Americans are reported dead from this vaccine — mostly from strokes, heart attacks and blood clots. Over 800,000 are reported injured, many of them hospitalized (over 83,000), many with life-threatening illness (over 18,000) and many others permanently disabled (over 26,000).</p>\r\n<p>This information is all publicly available and provided by the CDC. This cannot be called \"misleading\" by anyone in the media. The very definition of \"misleading\" would be to either disparage or ignore VAERS and not report on it daily to your readers.</p>\r\n<p>The number of deaths and significant injuries reported to VAERS is now dramatically higher than in the past 30-plus years combined. This has happened in only 10 months.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s a fact. Facts cannot be \"misleading.\"</p>\r\n<p>Several times in America\'s recent history, the medical community has suspended or canceled a vaccine program over a small number of deaths. The first rule of medicine is \"physician do no harm.\" At any sign of harm, a vaccine should and must be questioned and/or suspended.</p>\r\n<p>Never before have we even imagined a vaccine would be linked to over 17,000 deaths and over 800,000 adverse reactions.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, the official VAERS numbers have been blacked out from the mainstream media and social media — including your New York Times. Any time something is not discussed or debated and is disparaged as \"misleading\" because it is different from the official government narrative, I\'d call that the very definition of \"intolerance\" at best, and tyranny at worst.</p>\r\n<p>Even more facts and SCIENCE ...</p>\r\n<p>Studies are in from many countries, but in particular the U.K. and Israel, reporting:</p>\r\n<p>No. 1: The vaccine is in fact failing miserably — a huge majority of recent cases, hospitalizations and deaths are among double vaccinated individuals. FACT.</p>\r\n<p>No. 2: Cases are slightly higher in countries with higher vaccination rates, and slightly lower in countries with lower vaccination rates.</p>\r\n<p>These are factual, credible, scientific studies from multiple countries.</p>\r\n<p>So yes, I question this vaccine, and yes, I am seriously worried about the proven deaths and injuries directly from this vaccine in the short term (as seen on the VAERS reporting system), and I\'m especially worried about the long-term effects of this vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>If The New York Times believes anything I\'ve said is \"misleading,\" then you clearly don\'t understand the definition of \"science.\" I\'m quoting only government, CDC and scientific studies from multiple countries.</p>\r\n<p>More importantly, the very definition of \"science\" is asking questions and debating.</p>\r\n<p>To not ask questions, especially in the face of so many Americans sick with COVID-19 who are double vaccinated, and so many dead or injured directly from the vaccine as reported by VAERS, would make someone either naive, gullible, blind, deaf or very dumb.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m proud that my time at Columbia University taught me to think critically, ask questions, never accept as fact what any government agency or authority figure says and always be a fearless debater.</p>\r\n<p>By the way, I urge The New York Times to set up a debate on this topic. I\'ll be thrilled to debate any \"expert\" about this particular COVID-19 vaccine and the facts reported by VAERS and studies around the world. Let\'s do it.</p>\r\n<p>WAR</p>\r\n<p>Wayne Allyn Root</p>\r\n<p>P.S. After I sent this response, it was reported 77.7% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois last week were among vaccinated people. It was also reported Ireland has a massive COVID-19 outbreak, despite the country being 91% vaccinated. And an exhaustive yearlong study in the U.K. was released proving vaccinated people are just as likely to spread COVID-19 as the unvaccinated.</p>\r\n<p>The debate is over. The vaccine is a failure.

He is also an associate researcher with the Working Group on Propaganda and the 9/11 \"War on Terror\" and has served as an advisor to NATO leaders.</p>\n<p>From 2016 to 2019, Professor Robinson chaired the department of politics, society and political journalism at the University of Sheffield.</p>\n<p>He spoke at length about the propaganda aspects of COVID-19 in an Aug. 4 interview with Asia Pacific Today of Australia.</p>\n<p>{mp4}propaganda-expert-warns-of-global-covid-psyop{/mp4}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“COVID-19 is probably one of the biggest propaganda operations we’ve seen in history because of the global nature and the resources put into it,” Robinson said.  “It was pretty clear from the beginning that propaganda was being employed.”</p>\n<p>In the U.S., one of the main spigots of propaganda has been Dr. Anthony Fauci and the media’s elevation of him to god-like status, hanging on his every word and never pressing him to provide data to back up his constantly swerving pronouncements. Every Western government has its version of Fauci, spouting ever-changing, confusing information meant to keep the population off balance, afraid and confused.</p>\n<p>A fearful, dazed and weary public is less able to resist the dizzying array of draconian policies coming from governments, from facemask rules and incessant testing to quarantines of the healthy and mandatory mass vaccinations.</p>\n<p>In his latest effort to prepare Americans for even greater medical tyranny, Fauci went on national TV Aug. 8 and said <strong><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/dr-anthony-fauci-expect-a-flood-of-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-after-full-fda-approval/ar-AAN2483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“a flood”</a></strong> of new COVID vaccine mandates are coming down the pike as soon as the shots get FDA approval, which he expects to happen as soon as next month.</p>\n<p>Corporations are already piling on. Forbes reported Aug. 8 that companies are not only threatening to fire the unvaccinated; they are beginning to <strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2021/08/08/coming-soon-for-the-unvaccinated-a-50-monthly-paycheck-deduction-from-your-employer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tack on a special surcharge of up to $50</a></strong> for employees, deducting it from the paychecks of those who refuse the experimental shot.</p>\n<p>Fauci has continually frightened the American public for 18 months, wearing everyone down with a steady diet of propaganda.</p>\n<p>Which brings the subject back to Robinson, who has decades of studies under his belt in the art of propaganda in war time.</p>\n<p>Robinson documents how the British government sought expert advice from behavioral psychologists on how to use the media to manipulate public opinion by ratcheting up the level of fear surrounding the COVID pandemic.</p>\n<p>He cited U.K. government documents from March 2020 referencing groups skilled in applied psychology. They helped the government craft a plan of propaganda to drive a fear-based narrative with the goal of causing behavioral change.</p>\n<p>One such group was SPI-B or the Independent Scientific Influenza Group on Behaviors.</p>\n<p>“The key part of SPI-B’s behavioral change strategy that seems to have been adopted was to ‘persuade through fear,\'” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>The persuasion section of the document states: <em>“A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened.”</em></p>\n<p>Appendix B of the documents lists 10 options that can be used to increase social distancing in the public.</p>\n<p>Option 2 advises: “Use media to increase sense of personal threat.”</p>\n<p>SPI-B recommendations were to increase the sense of personal threat and “<strong>use hard hitting emotional messaging.”</strong> This included taglines such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Anyone can get it. Anyone can spread it.”</li>\n<li>“Don’t put your friends and family in danger.”</li>\n<li>“Stay home for your family. Don’t put their lives in danger.”</li>\n<li>“If you go out, you can spread it. People will die.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use of hysterical media headlines was another big part of the strategy.</p>\n<p>Big Tech quickly agreed to come on board with the censoring of all competing narratives that countered the fear-based approach.</p>\n<p>If that didn’t work, the psychologists argued for <em>shame and approval</em> tactics.</p>\n<p>SPI-B psychologists knew that fear on its own would not persuade everyone. Messaging needed to be tailored to take into account different “motivational levers.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the document suggested using both social approval and disapproval, with government compulsion as a backup, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Option 6:</strong> Use and promote social approval for desired behaviors.</li>\n<li><strong>Option 7:</strong> Consider enacting legislation to compel required behaviors.</li>\n<li><strong>Option 8:</strong> Consider use of social disapproval for failure to comply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As if on cue, the “heroes and covidiots” narrative began to appear in the “news.”</p>\n<p>The word “covidiots” was coined in spring 2020 by The Economist, the official magazine of the world’s most elite globalists. The magazine described “covidiots” as follows:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“The term “covidiot” describes any and every person behaving stupidly or irresponsibly as the epidemic spreads. Sometime in early March the word was born, and, almost as fast as the virus spread, so did instances of covidiotic behavior.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The U.S. government was party to similar discussions about how to control the media narrative about COVID at Event 201 in October 2019, two months before the virus was discovered in China.</p>\n<p>In Germany, equally insidious propaganda strategies have been documented within the so-called “<strong>Panic Paper</strong>,” a leaked document from the German Department of Interior that shows the population was deliberately driven to panic by politicians and mainstream media.</p>\n<p>Among other things, the Panic Paper calls for <strong>children to be made to feel responsible “for the painful tortured death of their parents and grandparents if they do not follow the corona rules,”</strong> that is, if they do not constantly wash their hands, put on masks and avoid contact with their grandparents.</p>\n<p>Scientific data shows children are not efficient spreaders of the virus but that couldn’t be allowed to disrupt the fear-based narrative. They were masked and socially distanced, their schools shut down, their social lives destroyed, leading to a record number of teen suicides.</p>\n<p>It became obvious to Robinson that the extreme government responses had nothing to do with public health.</p>\n<p>“What has becoming increasingly clear is this is not being driven by a health crisis,” he said. “We are seeing profound changes in our society.”</p>\n<p>The changes include everything from the introduction of digital currencies and vaccine passports with scannable QR codes, to the regulation of worship services and small businesses.</p>\n<p>The World Economic Forum immediately seized on the COVID pandemic as an “opportunity” to change the economic, political and social structure of the free world. Elites at the WEF, United Nations, the British Royal family, the Vatican, World Bank and International Monetary Fund did not hide their excitement about the “opportunity” that came with a global pandemic. In fact they were very open about it, writing books, making speeches and participating in glitzy promotional videos posted to YouTube.</p>\n<p>“What we seem to have here are political actors exploiting the circumstances for political, economic and social objectives,” Robinson said. “It’s certainly very clear for example, organizations such as the World Economic Forum had a very specific vision from the very beginning on how to respond to COVID and had a very specific vision for the future, talking about the Fourth Industrial Revolution, smart cities and so on, and it would appear that actors such as that are using and exploiting COVID for substantial political, economic and social restructuring.”</p>\n<p>The role of propaganda then becomes key because it conditions people to accept these drastic changes without any scrutiny or public debate, “because people are thinking this is all about a virus and people are scared. So all of the transformative changes are being swept through without any scrutiny. This is very, very dangerous. A terrified population has extracted a huge opportunity for people with agendas who have the power to realize that.</p>\n<p>“So we are moving into pretty worrying territory now, in terms of how governments are behaving.”</p>\n<p>Those who speak out against the propaganda start to be treated as the “other.”</p>\n<p>The virus now becomes an engine to drive society to vaccine passports, a digital ID system and a social-credit scoring system similar to what’s used in China to keep people toeing the government line.</p>\n<p>“All of these seem to revolve around a major restructuring of society, major redistribution of wealth, much more control, much less democracy,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>The role of the mask</strong></p>\n<p>Laura Dodsworth, in her book <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/State-Fear-government-weaponised-Covid-19-ebook/dp/B08ZSYN14J\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A State of Fear: How the UK Government Weaponized Fear During the Covid-19 Pandemic</a></strong>, interviewed behavioral psychologists that work for the UK government. What she found was astonishing: the mask was primarily about keeping people’s fear levels up.</p>\n<p>“Keeping the virus in the forefront of people’s minds,” Robinson said. “Behavior scientists admitted that’s what the mask is mainly about. It’s not about protecting people from a virus but managing their perception of the virus.”</p>\n<p>Governments set up snitchlines in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia, and throughout the formerly free world, further dividing their populations and turning friends and family against each other.</p>\n<p>“This concept of divide and control is becoming more apparent. We’re starting to see it over the last couple of weeks in terms of mandated vaccination,” Robison said.</p>\n<p>Headlines like this from the LA Times are commonplace, “COVID-19 cases surge in L.A. County, fueled by ‘enormously selfish’ unvaccinated.”</p>\n<p>Often the media campaigns for even more restrictions than are currently put in place by the government, such as barring the unvaccinated from airline flights, restaurants, stores and basically every public venue, even outdoor sporting events and concerts.</p>\n<p>Blaming the unvaccinated for continued flare ups of the pandemic is everywhere.</p>\n<p>“This should ring alarm bells for anyone who has even the most basic grasp of history. You start to talk about segregation, you start to talk about people who are unclean, unhealthy, unvaccinated versus vaccinated,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>None of these policies is based on scientific data.</p>\n<p>“All of the level-headed epidemiologists that I listen to are very clear that this idea that the unvaccinated spread the virus is not accurate scientifically, but that is the kind of message which is being communicated by people who have been pushing the agenda from the beginning,” Robinson said. “And that will create divisions, and we’ve been in this kind of place in history and it ends very badly when we start segregating people and we start using that language. But, quite terrifyingly, this is the language which is being used by the people who have been pushing draconian restrictions, vaccines, for the last two years.”</p>\n<p>Former Fox News commentator Piers Morgan, for example, took to Twitter last week and suggested that the <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaccinewars.com/2021-08-05-morgan-calls-for-unvaccinated-to-be-denied-treatment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unvaccinated should be denied medical treatment</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>“We know from history this kind of talk can lead to very, very dark places,” said Robinson. “Many of the things we are seeing, the need to carry special passports for instance, have parallels in 1930s Germany.</p>\n<p>“Very credible, eminent scientists, are now being smeared in the media because of their anti-lockdown views or for questioning the Covid vaccines. The casual smearing is certainly a big part of what’s going on. This should be another warning sign to those who think everything is OK and there are no problems out there. People should ask themselves, why are very eminent scientists from the beginning [<em>like Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Robert Malone</em>] being smeared and being censored and shut down and shut out from debates? That tells you something. That tells you this isn’t a rational response that’s going on. This is a propagandized response. And it’s being carried through by shutting people up, by humiliating them, smearing them and so on.”</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>All institutions complicit in the propaganda</strong> <strong>war</strong></p>\n<p>Mainstream journalists operate in close proximity to people in political power. They frequent the same groups and social gatherings.</p>\n<p>“They share basically the same outlook,” Robinson noted. “They depend on each other for information. So journalists are not as critical as they should be and not as independent as they should be. So it shouldn’t surprise us that when it comes to Covid, they are reluctant to go against the government narrative.”</p>\n<p>Those in academia also tend to self-censor. They come up against pressure within institutions to “stay within the program,” leading to a groupthink mentality.</p>\n<p>“We are seeing lawmakers, parliaments being incredibly timid, and not engaging in the kind of democratic scrutiny that they should be,” he said. “So I think we’re seeing all of the institutions in our society being bent to this propaganda campaign.”</p>\n<p>He said hope lies in new political parties that are rising against the establishment, but it’s too early to tell if they will gain the traction needed to turn back the tide of authoritarianism in nations that have a long history of freedom.</p>\n<p>“Most of our democratic institutions are hollowed out. We need to get democracy back,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p><strong>Those fighting for the resistance have a small window to get their message out, educate the public and stem the tide.</strong></p>\n<p>“In all my life I have never experienced anything as worrying and as extreme as what we’re seeing at the moment,” Robinson said. “You’re not going to be able to rely on your local politician or the mainstream media to suddenly pick up this issue. We’re in a phase where people need to mobilize, and that’s what we’re seeing. And that means not relying on your mainstream or established political parties.”</p>\n<p>The growing protest movements in France and Italy will need to continue to intensify and spread beyond Europe if they are going to be successful.</p>\n<p>People must get out and start organizing and communicating with like-minded groups. That’s the key, as Robinson sees it.</p>\n<p>“We will have to see how this develops, the people getting out in the streets and the new political parties representing those views. Will that start to change the course of what we’re seeing?”</p>\n<p>Robinson’s gut feeling is that it will, but one can sense his hesitancy to become too optimistic.</p>\n<p>“I sort of have a feeling in my own heart, maybe just my instinct, that it’s so extreme what is being proposed: lockdowns, and vaccinating children, people being forced to vaccinate. This is so extreme that as this goes on, the numbers who are willing to organize and join new parties will increase.</p>\n<p>“We can’t see for sure what is going to happen. My guestimate at the moment, is the propaganda around Covid 19 is quite a fragile bubble.</p>\n<p>“In my career researching and exposing propaganda I’ve never seen this number of people who are waking up.</p>\n<p>“All the alarm bells are ringing with anyone who has a knowledge of history, and a knowledge of propaganda, how governments don’t always operate in the best interests of their populations. All the alarm bells are ringing, and we are in extremely dangerous times, unfortunately, and very worrying for the future.”</p>\n<p>So what is the end game?</p>\n<p>“There are some great investigative journalists out there, who have reported on the World Economic Forum and the idea that the end game is a restructuring of society which involves more control over individuals and their lives by the state,” Robinson said.</p>\n<p>“There are many theories out there. But one thing is clear; this all seems to be driving toward a real end to proper freedom. If you have a vaccination passport which you need to get into your supermarket, you’re not actually free anymore.”</p>\n<p>Digital currencies are another thing that seems to be in the offing.</p>\n<p>“This gives a tremendous shift in power to governments,” he said. “This is all pretty anti-democratic. If you think democracy and freedom are generally good things, and I’m one of them who does, this is all extremely concerning.</p>\n<p>“We are at a pivotal moment…it could go either way. That’s why people must mobilize and realize something is wrong beyond COVID-19.”</p>\n<p>As for the QR codes on the vaccine passports, “we should have all learned a lesson after 9/11, with the Patriot Act, surveillance, monitoring everything, and governments, if they can get away with it, will exploit all of this.”</p>\n<p>Seeing the writing on the wall, some resisters are already talking about buying swaths of land and forming self-supporting communities that exist off the grid.</p>\n<p>“Hopefully,” Robinson mused, “it isn’t coming to that.”</p>\n<p>[<i>Editor\'s note: This story originally was published by <a href=\"https://leohohmann.com/2021/08/10/renowned-propaganda-expert-worst-is-still-to-come-in-global-psy-op-if-people-do-not-rise-up-and-resist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LeoHohmann.com</a>.</i>]</p>\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.wnd.com/2021/08/propaganda-expert-warns-global-covid-psyop/\">https://www.wnd.com/2021/08/propaganda-expert-warns-global-covid-psyop/</a> </p>', '1', '107', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/surveillance-spying-watching-masks-covid-coronavirus-screens-taiwan-military-defense.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '9', '38', '', '', '1', '62', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

In addition, due to the toxic nature of our environment, we need larger amounts of essential nutrients to help our over worked detoxification systems function.</p>\n<p>Not all supplements are made the same. Since there are no regulatory mechanisms in place for the industry, some supplements may have harmful non-active ingredients in them, and some may not have as much of the actual active ingredient in them as listed on the packaging.</p>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong> (recommended as buffered ascorbic acid to ease potential gastrointestinal distress)\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly every cell in the human body needs this vitamin to function. It is necessary for a healthy heart, for healthy skin, ears, nose, throat, stomach and intestinal functioning, musculoskeletal system, for healthy reproductive organ functioning in both males and females, for a healthy pregnancy and baby, for healthy eyes, brain, lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, immune system, gums and the prevention of obesity….just to name a few. This vitamin is also a potent antioxidant (antioxidants stabilize free radical scavengers, which cause cancer and other disease states), and has powerful anti viral and anti bacterial properties.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Probiotics</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>All bacteria are not bad. Humans are designed to live symbiotically with various strains of bacteria and other microorganisms. Good gut flora are absolutely essential to physical health and mental well-being. </li>\n<li>Your gut is the first brain. Some would say more important than the actual brain. These networks of brain cells (nerve networks) in the gut are responsible for feeling a sense of well-being and satisfaction in the world, as well as serving our immune systems so that they can protect us from harmful toxins and pathogens that cause disease, and are necessary to maintain healthy digestion in our stomachs and intestines.</li>\n<li>There are many strains of probiotics that are helpful. To keep it simple, here are three that I recommend that All people will benefit from – lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and saccharomyces boulardii.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Vitamin A</strong> – 200 mg a day has anti-viral properties</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>B Vitamins</strong> – Take a strong B complex every morning (This could energize you and interfere with sleep) with food (could upset your stomach without food.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Vitamin E</strong> – 400 mg twice a day</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Omega Fatty Acids</strong> – I like Nordic Naturals, Pro Omega 2000, twice a day. Put them in the freezer to avoid ‘fish burps’.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Selenium</strong> – 200 mcg a day.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Zinc</strong> – Zinc Picolinate is the optimal form, due to it’s high bioavailability. Start with 30 mg a day and titrate up to 60 mg in a few days. Take with food. The best absorption is when you take this separate from other supplements.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Magnesium</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 700 necessary reactions in your body cannot occur without magnesium. It is an essential cofactor in numerous chemical reactions in our bodies. (A cofactor is something that has to bind to an enzyme in a chemical reaction for the enzyme to work. An enzyme in a chemical reaction changes one thing into a new thing. Everything in the human body runs via various chemical reactions.) That means that without this ion (charged particle), your body cannot perform the necessary functions of life.</li>\n<li>Magnesium regulates temperature, produces and transports energy within every cell of the body, is necessary for the conduction of the heart and the nervous system and brain, relaxes muscles and alleviates anxiety. Fat, protein and glucose cannot be metabolized without it. It is also vital in the absorption of calcium to maintain strong bones, and allows the body to use stored vitamin D.</li>\n<li>As a psychiatrist, clinically it has been incredibly effective to help people relax and feel less anxious, it alleviates the symptoms of restless leg syndrome and has been the only answer for many patients who would sweat uncontrollably and excessively in the heat. It can be used topically, orally, or in the bath.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Fulvic Ionic Minerals</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When agriculture was a natural process, and soil was toxin free and naturally replenished with vital nutrients and minerals, our food contained a plentiful supply of fulvic ionic minerals. These ionic minerals make up fulvic acid, a natural substance that greatly increases the amount of vitamins and minerals that are absorbed into our cells, so our bodies can utilize them in the essential reactions necessary for life. In today’s world, soil is depleted due current farming practices and our neglect of considering the long-term benefits of healthy soil conditions. This weakened soil contains very little fulvic acid, and it cannot store and uptake water and nutrients effectively, or pass the fulvic acid into the food so those who eat it can remain healthy.</li>\n<li>This solution of minerals enhances cognition, supports the immune system, assists in the digestion and assimilation of nutrients, helps to detoxify the body and provides essential electrolytes that allow us to utilize the nutrients we take in.</li>\n<li>Fulvic minerals are also great to put in your soil when you are growing your own beautiful organic produce</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Vitamin D3 and K2 (Mk7)</strong> – Cells need vitamin D to function, but without K2 the vitamin D cannot be utilized properly. The best food source of Mk7 (the most important form of K2) is in fermented soy beans (Natto) and other fermented foods.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vitamin D3</strong> – take a minimum of 5000 IU a day (125 mcg.) together with K2</li>\n<li><strong>K2</strong> – aim for 150 mcg. a day</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Organic CBD Oil</strong> – The endocanabanoid system is a great source of immune boosting strength. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>Elderberries</strong> – Research found compounds in black elderberry (Sambucus nigra) could directly inhibit viral entry into cells and subsequent replication, in part attributed to the anthocyanidin responsible for the vivid purple coloring of the fruit. It also decreases the length of a viral illness.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"bullet-list\">\n<li><strong>“Let Food Be Thy Medicine”</strong> – Foods include: Organic grass-fed raw, unpasteurized milk and whey protein (from organic, grass-fed cows); fermented foods; raw, organic eggs from free-range chickens; grass-fed beef or organ meats; coconuts and coconut oil; organic vegetables; blueberries and raspberries; mushrooms; chlorella; propolis; teas; and herbs and spices (see below).\n<ul>\n<li>Mushrooms strengthen your immune system because they are rich in protein, fiber, vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, and other minerals. Mushrooms also contain powerful compounds called <em>beta-glucans</em>, which have been long known for their immune enhancing properties. Beta-glucan <sup>3</sup> enhances immunity through a variety of mechanisms, many of which are similar to those of echinacea or astragalus root.</li>\n<li>Chlorella is a single-cell freshwater algae that acts as an efficient detoxification agent by binding to toxins, such as mercury, and carries them out of your system. It is the chlorophyll in chlorella that makes it so powerful. Chlorophyll helps you process more oxygen, cleanses your blood and promotes the growth and repair of your tissues.</li>\n<li>Propolis is a bee resin and one of the most broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds in the world, if not <em>the</em> broadest spectrum, according to master herbalist Donnie Yance. Propolis is also the richest source of caffeic acid and apigenin, two very important phenolic compounds that aid in immune response.</li>\n<li>Organic green teas, matcha (unfermented green teas)</li>\n<li>Tulsi Tea (Holy Basil)</li>\n<li>Chaga Tea</li>\n<li>Garlic (anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-viral)</li>\n<li>Honeysuckle and chrysanthemum (good antivirals)</li>\n<li>Artemisia, Andrographis (“King of Bitters”- antiviral and helps modulate inflammatory response)</li>\n<li>Licorice (buffers the inflammatory response by increasing steroid output by the adrenal glands)</li>\n<li>Turmeric, black pepper, oregano, cinnamon, cloves, elderflower</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>', '1', '108', '2021-09-03 22:36:47', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-09-03 22:36:47', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/let-food-be-thy-medicine-640-2.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '18', '1', '', '', '1', '120', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

('62', '3481', 'Hundreds of thousands of covid vaccine injuries BACKLOGGED', 'hundreds-of-thousands-of-covid-vaccine-injuries-backlogged', '<p>(<a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/\">Natural News</a>) On the latest episode of “Doctors and Scientists,” Dr. Brian Hooker Ph.D., P.E., was interviewed Dr. Jessica Rose, Ph.D. to discuss the <a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/chd-tv-doctors-scientists-brian-hooker-jessica-rose-vaers-system/\">failures of the vaccine injury surveillance system</a> that was set up by the CDC and FDA over thirty years ago. Dr. Rose is an expert in bio-mathematics and molecular research.</p>', '<p>In January of 2021, she utilized her skills as a computational biologist and began analyzing data in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Each week, she downloaded publicly-available data sets from VAERS, comparing inputs week-to-week. She discovered that vaccine injury reports went missing from one week to the next. Each week, the data is updated in the VAERS system. She found that some of the data is overwritten, vanished from the system. She also found that “hundreds of thousands” of covid vaccine injury reports were backlogged and did not appear in a timely manner to alert healthcare professionals to serious issues with the vaccine.</p>\n<h2>Hundreds of thousands of vaccine injury reports backlogged in VAERS</h2>\n<p>In the interview, Dr. Rose discussed the systemic flaws of the VAERS system, flaws that stop the passive reporting system from working in the public’s interest, as was originally intended. The pharmacovigilance system was set up in 1990 to detect issues with vaccines, to alert regulatory agencies and the public about serious adverse events and contraindications for specific vaccines. The data is managed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Healthcare professionals input the data into the system, and have a narrow thirty-minute window to complete the report. In 2021, healthcare workers have been overwhelmed with vaccine injury reports and have not had the time to enter them all into the system. Many medical concerns associated with the covid vaccine are overlooked, discarded or discounted as coincidental or normalized reactions <a href=\"http://vaccinedamage.news/\">to the vaccine</a>.</p>\n<p>The hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports that have been filed paint a grisly picture of medical malfeasance. These serious public health issues have yet to be addressed by any regulatory agency or judicial process. In the past, vaccines were pulled from the market if the VAERS system documented more than fifty deaths from a single vaccine. In 2021, there have been more than 20,000 deaths recorded in just ten months. Up to 97 percent of these issues are coming from the new mRNA covid vaccines, not the rest of the vaccine supply. Instead of pulling the deadly products from the market, the federal government has issued unlawful mandates, coercing individuals to take part in the depopulation experiment. This might be the biggest flaw with the system yet: The agencies that are supposed to oversee the data and alert the public to medical atrocities are the same entities trying to push a narrative forward – that vaccines are “safe and effective.” (Related: COVID vaccine experiment causes <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-24-covid-vaccine-experiment-causes-monstrous-spike-in-vaccine-injuries.html\">monstrous spike in vaccine injuries and deaths</a>, serious adverse events under-reported by a factor of eight.)</p>\n<h2>Serious adverse events and fatalities are occurring at magnitudes greater than what is recorded in the VAERS system</h2>\n<p>After analyzing missing data in the VAERS system, Dr. Rose came to the conclusion that serious adverse events and fatalities following covid vaccination are much higher than what is recorded in the VAERS system. Some issues are under-reported by a factor of thirty-one, and other, more common side effects can be under-reported by a factor of one hundred. By September, Dr. Rose attended the FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting, bringing attention to under-reporting problem in the VAERS system. <a href=\"https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_0490c898f7514df4b6fbc5935da07322.pdf\">Her research is titled</a>, “Critical Appraisal of VAERS Pharmacovigilance: Is the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) a Functioning Pharmacovigilance System?” and was published in <em>Science, Public Health Policy and Law.</em></p>\n<p>Her paper concludes that “hundreds of thousands” of adverse events are backlogged and waiting to be entered into the system. “The most important thing I found in my determination is whether or not this tool — which can be a pharmacovigilance tool — is being used as such,” Dr. Rose said.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/chd-tv-doctors-scientists-brian-hooker-jessica-rose-vaers-system/\">ChildrensHealthDefense.org</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-24-covid-vaccine-experiment-causes-monstrous-spike-in-vaccine-injuries.html\">NaturalNews.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_0490c898f7514df4b6fbc5935da07322.pdf\">IPAKPHPI.com</a> [PDF]</p>\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-31-hundreds-of-thousands-covid-vaccine-injuries-backlogged-not-entered-into-vaers.html\">https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-10-31-hundreds-of-thousands-covid-vaccine-injuries-backlogged-not-entered-into-vaers.html</a> </p>', '1', '110', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:14:03', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/All-deaths-reported-to-VAERS-by-year.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '13', '19', '', '', '1', '44', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>U.S. county data indicates that there is no significant case decrease in counties with a higher percentage of the population fully vaccinated.</p>\n<h2>Countries With Vaccination Rates of  Under 10 Percent Have Less COVID Than Those With 75 Percent Vaccinated</h2>\n<p>The gathered data demonstrated that countries with vaccination rates over 75 percent, such as Portugal and Iceland, exhibited higher rates of COVID-19 than Vietnam and South Africa, where less than ten percent of the population is vaccinated.</p>\n<p>According to the article, four of the top five U.S. counties with the highest vaccination rates ranging from 84.3 percent to 99.9 percent are identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as “high” transmission counties. Of the 57 counties that are classified as “low” transmission counties, 26.3 percent have a vaccination rate below 20 percent.</p>\n<h2>Obesity and Other Modifiable Risk Factors Should Be Addressed</h2>\n<p>The study authors state that sole reliance on vaccination as the primary strategy to combat COVID-19 should be re-examined and that other interventions and preventatives, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, may need to be put in place.</p>\n<p>The need for non-pharmacological interventions and preventatives echoes what many researchers, doctors, and others have been saying about the lack of general health guidance throughout the pandemic. Many research articles present data demonstrating an increased likelihood of complications related to COVID-19 when individuals have comorbidities, such as high blood pressure and obesity. The World Obesity Federation has shown that death rates from COVID-19 are ten times higher in countries where more than half of the population is overweight.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn\" name=\"_ednref2\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to the CDC, 73.6 percent of Americans are overweight, 42.5 percent are obese.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">3</a></sup> Daniel Donner, MD, a physician at Novan’s Pediatric Clinic in North Carolina stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It feels like—at least in the messaging that I’ve seen—as though (obesity is) being treated as more of a footnote than anything else and something I feel like a lot of people have missed.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">4</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Natural Immunity Stronger Than Vaccine-Induced Immunity</h2>\n<p>In their article,<sup>1</sup> Subramanian and Kumar cite several studies which indicate that natural immunity may offer stronger immunity than the Pfizer vaccine and that the Pfizer vaccine is showing substantially lower efficacy in the real world compared to clinical trial data upon which the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and licensing approval was based. Pfizer clinical trial efficacy was noted as 96 percent, while a recent report released from the Ministry of Health in Israel demonstrates the vaccine efficacy to be only 39 percent.</p>\n<p>Although vaccination may offer protection against severe hospitalization and death, the CDC has reported an increase from 0.01 percent to 9 percent for hospitalization and zero to 15.1 percent for death among those who are fully vaccinated.</p>\n<p>Researchers from Columbia Public Health estimated that by the end of 2020, one in three Americans, or 103 million people, had contracted natural infection COVID-19.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Last month, <em>The Washington Post</em> reported that more than 15 studies have demonstrated the power of natural immunity, suggesting that it is as good as or better than vaccine-induced immunity.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\">6</a></sup> Natural immunity to COVID is powerful. Policymakers seem afraid to say so. <em>The Washington Post </em>Sept. 15, 2021.) One of those articles includes a 700,000 person study from Israel which found that those who had contracted COVID-19 in the past were 27 times less likely to get a second asymptomatic infection than those who were vaccinated.</p>\n<p>A previous Cleveland Clinic study that included healthcare workers found that none of the employees who had previously tested positive for COVID had been re-infected. The study concluded that those previously infected were unlikely to benefit from vaccination.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\">7</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Rejecting Natural Immunity Leads to “Damaged Credibility”</h2>\n<p>As John Hopkins Professor Marty Makary wrote in <em>The Washington Post:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The incorrect hypothesis that natural immunity is unreliable has resulted in the loss of thousands of American lives, avoidable vaccine complications, and damaged the credibility of public health officials. Given the recent mandate announcement by the White House, it would be good for our public health leaders to show humility by acknowledging the hypothesis they repeatedly trumpeted was not only wrong, but it may be harmful.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\">7</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last month, when Anthony Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), was asked whether natural immunity was equal to or better than the vaccine, he stated that he didn’t have a “firm answer” and that it was something that was going to need to be discussed “seriously.”<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>Consideration for natural immunity was not in the sweeping nationwide mandates issued by the White House this summer, which affects 100. million Americans and requires for both private and public-sector employees to be vaccinated. In August, Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a mandate for all military personnel. Punishments for those refusing to comply include administrative or non-judicial punishment, relief of duties, and potentially, dishonorable discharge.<sup><a href=\"https://thevaccinereaction.org/2021/10/study-finds-covid-cases-unrelated-to-vaccination-rates/#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\">9</a></sup></p>\n<h2>California Orders COVID Vaccine Mandates for Children</h2>\n<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced earlier this month that the state would now require the COVID-19 vaccine for children 12 years and older, which is the first COVID vaccine mandate in the country for children.</p>\n<p>Subramanian and Kumar end their article calling for COVID vaccination policies to be implemented with humility and respect…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In summary, even as efforts should be made to encourage populations to get vaccinated it should be done so with humility and respect.

In Chaudhry’s opinion, the unvaccinated are to blame, and anyone who disagrees does not deserve to be a doctor.</p>\n<p>“We may have a situation in hand where the vaccine isn’t even effective,” Chaudhry admitted in a statement, adding that the United States is “not there now” but could be if medical professionals do not obey his command that they all push the vaccine in tandem.</p>\n<p>“When the state boards get a complaint, they will investigate and if they determine there’s grounds for taking action, they will,” Chaudhry promised, again threatening to destroy the lives of all physicians who disagree with him.</p>\n<p>Kevin Klauer, DO, CEO of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), agrees with this approach. He stated that he believes the FSMB is “empowered to set the boundaries of professional conduct,” which includes restricting what doctors say on social media under threat of losing their medical license.</p>\n<p>“The vaccines have proven to be safe and effective, and are saving thousands of lives,” Klauer alleges, adding that “dissuading people from getting a vaccine that the medical community embraces is harmful.”</p>\n<p>The latest news about Wuhan Flu oppression can be found at <a href=\"http://pandemic.news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pandemic.news</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources for this article include:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/93877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MedpageToday.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/WAZLp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Archive.is</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-05-26-yes-covid-vaccines-are-spreading-variants.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NaturalNews.com</a>.<br /><br />Source:  <a href=\"https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-08-13-boards-threaten-revoke-licenses-doctors-covid-vaccines.html\">https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-08-13-boards-threaten-revoke-licenses-doctors-covid-vaccines.html</a> </p>', '1', '111', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-09 12:25:04', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/Coronavirus-Hospital-Works-Nurses-Doctors.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '7', '4', '', '', '1', '70', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

To kids, that’s everything.”</p>\r\n<p>The Asens are one family of thousands across Maine who will have at least one family member become newly eligible for the Pfizer vaccine. Federal regulators are on the cusp of approving the Pfizer vaccine for ages 5-11, with shots in arms starting as soon as Wednesday or Thursday. The Food and Drug Administration gave its final approval on Friday, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must follow suit this week for the vaccines to become available.</p>\r\n<p>Presuming the vaccine is given the final green light this week, the Pfizer vaccine’s formulation for ages 5-11 will be one-third the dosage given to adults.</p>\r\n<p>But not everyone is as eager for their children to become vaccinated as the Asens.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PERSUADING PARENTS</strong></p>\r\n<p>An October survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 27 percent of American families are ready to get their elementary-aged children vaccinated as soon as it’s approved. However, 35 percent say they definitely will not or will only do so if required. One-third are in the “wait and see” category.</p>\r\n<p>Michelle Richards of Scarborough said she’s undecided about vaccinating her 10-year-old daughter. Richards said she plans on discussing it with her pediatrician before a planned school COVID-19 clinic next week. Richards said she’s worried about long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>“We’re still trying to decide what we’re going to do,” Richards said. “Everything is still so new. I don’t feel like we should run out and do it right away. We want to gather more information.”</p>\r\n<p>Aside from the logistical hurdles surrounding making the vaccine available for about 80,000 Maine children starting this week, public health officials say a big challenge will be persuading the “wait-and-see” parents about the value of the vaccine.</p>\r\n<div id=\"attachment_27203364\" class=\"caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/10/27198933_20211029_KidsVaccines0336-1024x711.jpg?rel=related\" data-full-size=\"https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/27198933_20211029_KidsVaccines0336.jpg\" data-caption=\"Dr. Andrew Tenenbaum, a pediatrician with InterMed, in an exam room in South Portland on Friday.

Many parents just want to wait and see. I tell them the vaccine has been studied, and there were no shortcuts in the studies. This is our best ticket out of … this pandemic.”</p>\r\n<p>Tenenbaum said the most common misconception he’s heard from parents is that the vaccine could cause problems with fertility, even though the science clearly shows the COVID-19 vaccines do not affect fertility.</p>\r\n<p>“Serious side effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unlikely following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination,” according to the U.S. CDC.</p>\r\n<p>If the pattern for elementary schoolchildren follows the same pattern as what happened with their older brothers and sisters in middle and high schools – who have been eligible for the vaccines since this spring – immunization rates will vary in different parts of the state.</p>\r\n<p>Four in five Cumberland County residents ages 12-19 are fully immunized, and nearly 70 percent in Knox and Lincoln counties. But vaccination rates in Piscataquis, Washington, Somerset and Lincoln counties for that age group are less than 46 percent.</p>\r\n<p>Those geographic trends are similar when it comes to adult vaccinations, although vaccination rates for youths are significantly lower overall.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out in a media briefing last week that the percentage of people willing to get vaccinated can change over time as acceptance grows. That’s what happened with vaccines for adults.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, 80 percent of people ages 12 and older are fully vaccinated in Maine, slightly above the national average of 78 percent. But a national Kaiser Family Foundation survey in September 2020, before vaccines became widely available in 2021, showed that only 63 percent of adults said they “definitely” or “probably” would get vaccinated.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a South Portland pediatrician, said when she tries to persuade parents in the “wait-and-see” category, she emphasizes that the more people are vaccinated, the closer to normal their children’s lives – and everyone’s lives – will be.</p>\r\n<p>“I try to talk to parents about how the vaccines are important for the continuation of school and the programming that kids like – sports and activities – and the need for kids to have a life that’s more normal,” Blaisdell said. “When kids have to quarantine and miss school, that disruption in kids’ lives and parents’ lives is one of the issues I talk to parents most about.”</p>\r\n<p>The Maine Department of Education reported Thursday that there have been 144 outbreaks in Maine schools in the past 30 days, and nearly 3,000 people testing positive. The department does not say how many of those people are students versus adults. But each outbreak typically means students who were exposed and are not vaccinated must quarantine at home and miss classes.</p>\r\n<p>Blaisdell said the upcoming holidays are also a key point in favor of the vaccines. Children who get vaccinated in mid-November can be fully vaccinated by December.</p>\r\n<p>“I try to get them to think about traveling to visit older grandparents or people in the family who may be immune-compromised, and children’s role in transmitting the disease,” Blaisdell said. “Kids clearly transmit the delta variant very efficiently, and they can do so with very few symptoms.”</p>\r\n<p>Research shows being vaccinated significantly reduces the chances of transmitting the virus to someone else.</p>\r\n<p>Asen said also top of mind is that by having Davida immunized, it will help protect other family members, including her 3-year-old sister and infant brother, grandparents and a 95-year-old great-grandmother.</p>\r\n<p>And while it’s rare for children to get severe COVID-19 to the point that they are hospitalized or die, it’s not impossible. Children with COVID-19 have been known to contract multi-inflammatory syndrome, a very rare condition where organs can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs, according to the U.S. CDC.</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE ROLLOUT</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, the largest health care network in the state, said they are working on standing up clinics across the state, primarily in schools and community clinics. Pharmacies and doctor’s offices will also be places where the vaccine will be available.</p>\r\n<p>But Mills said to avoid pediatrician’s offices being swamped with requests for the vaccine, MaineHealth is working to quickly launch the school-based clinics. Some will start up the week of Nov. 8, and others the following week.</p>\r\n<p>“This is our water on the pandemic fire,” Mills said. “We’re very geared up. The challenge is to hit the demand just right. The demand will be high for a while and then dissipate, but we don’t know how long the demand will be high. We want to do as many vaccine clinics as possible before Thanksgiving week so that kids can get the second dose in before Christmas week.”</p>\r\n<p>The first and second doses for the Pfizer vaccine are spaced three weeks apart.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on how many parents sign up their children for vaccination, having ages 5-11 immunized will increase the state’s overall vaccination rates by about 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent, Mills said.</p>\r\n<p>“This is a critical age group to vaccinate,” Mills said. “This is a population that gathers a lot, not just in schools but on playgrounds and in other people’s homes. This is a population we believe are major transmitters of the disease.”</p>\r\n<div id=\"attachment_26829858\" class=\"caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/10/AP21280581674589-1024x683.jpg?rel=related\" data-full-size=\"https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/AP21280581674589.jpg\" data-caption=\"Sarah Staffiere adjusts a face covering on her daughter Natalie before school recently in Waterville.

Gabe’s sister, Natalie, just turned 5 and will also get vaccinated. “We’ve been very, very cautious with everything we’re doing.”</p>\r\n<p>Staffiere said although their children attend school in-person, they’ve also had to say “no” to a lot of activities that other families have gotten back to doing, to keep Gabe safe. Once their children are fully vaccinated, they can start saying “yes” again, whether it’s basketball, baseball, swim lessons, or even hugging their grandparents. Halloween will be an at-home candy hunt instead of trick-or-treating.</p>\r\n<p>“Gabe brought a flier home this fall about playing soccer, and he said all my friends are doing this, can I play, and I had to say you have to wait,” Staffiere said. “He has missed out on a lot of social growth.”</p>\r\n<p>Staffiere said her children have “carried the burden” because they’ve had to be so cautious since March 2020.</p>\r\n<p>“I want them to not be afraid anymore,” Staffiere said. “But soon we can start to do all those things that we’ve held back on.”</p>\r\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.centralmaine.com/2021/10/31/will-maine-parents-get-their-young-children-vaccinated/\">https://www.centralmaine.com/2021/10/31/will-maine-parents-get-their-young-children-vaccinated/</a> </p>', '1', '111', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2021-11-11 22:18:21', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/11\\/11\\/ap21280581674589-300x20.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '10', '5', '', '', '1', '94', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '1', '*', '', ''),

Officials say that these smaller vials contain one-third the amount of spike protein witch’s brew as the adult-size version.</p>\n<p>As many as 28 million children living in the United States will be eligible for the injections, though there is one last regulatory hurdle: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is almost sure to green-light it.</p>\n<p>“With this vaccine, kids can go back to something that’s better than being locked at home on remote learning, not being able to see their friends,” announced Kawsar Talaat of <a href=\"https://www.jhu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>Johns Hopkins University</i></a> (JHU). “The vaccine will protect them and also protect our communities.”</p>\n<p>What Talaat did not mention, of course, is that the only thing stopping children from not being “locked at home on remote learning” friendless are the corrupt school boards, which are so infested with Branch Covidians that all kinds of insane rules are being mandated that have zero basis in science.</p>\n<p>The Biden regime is also to blame for keeping this ridiculous charade going, as are the millions of Americans who just go along with it like good little lemmings instead of fighting back like their forefathers would have done.</p>\n<h2>Africa, India both already defeated covid with ivermectin</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile, non-western countries that were never indoctrinated into the religious cult of Covidism have pretty much eliminated the Chinese Virus from their borders using tried-and-true remedies and common sense.</p>\n<p>In central Africa, for instance, the death rate among people who test “positive” for Chinese Germs has dropped to almost zero, thanks to the widespread use of ivermectin as an early remedy.</p>\n<p>Conversely, in the northern and southern countries of Africa where ivermectin is not being used, Fauci Flu deaths are still spiking.</p>\n<p>The same is true of India, as those regions accepting of ivermectin have seen the <i>plandemic</i> almost completely disappear. On the flip side, Indian regions where the fake “vaccines” are being used are seeing skyrocketing hospitalizations and deaths.</p>\n<p>Everywhere you look, there is a direct correlation between waves of sickness and heavy vaccination. Wherever you find jabs going into arms, there you will also find lots of sick and dying people whose conditions are being falsely blamed on “covid.”</p>\n<p>We continue to warn our readers about these important facts because almost nobody in the mainstream media is even considering them. The script says to blame every bad thing on the “unvaccinated” while claiming that the “fully vaccinated” would have ended this already were it not for the former.</p>\n<p>It makes zero sense, of course, but nothing really has since the start of this exercise in stupidity, ignorance and compliance. Perhaps the world is already far past the point of no return.</p>\n<p>“Sick bunch of people,” wrote one commenter at <i>Citizen Free Press</i>. “What will they do when kids start dying? Probably nothing because they care more for the billions they will be making. Totally disgusting people.”</p>\n<p>“They are all standing in the boardroom, looking at each other perplexed, totally in shock that they have gotten this far with this con,” suggested another.</p>\n<p>“Haven’t we learned yet the world is a bunch of rich people with a swindle, who have friends in high places, who change the rules to favor their get rich quick scheme.

This “Newtonian Schema” takes the past as primary and uses it to solve for the future, explaining our universe one time-step at a time. Some researchers even go so far as to think of the universe as the output of a forward-running computer program, a picture that is a natural extension of this schema. Even though our view of time has changed dramatically in the last century, the Newtonian Schema has somehow endured as our most popular physics framework.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">But imposing old Newtonian Schema thinking on new quantum-scale phenomena has landed us in situations with no good explanations whatsoever. If these phenomena seem inexplicable, we may just be thinking about them in the wrong way. Much better explanations become available if we are willing to take the future into account as well as the past. But Newtonian-style thinking is inherently incapable of such time-neutral explanations. Computer programs run in only one direction, and trying to combine two programs running in opposite directions leads to the paradoxical morass of poorly plotted time-travel movies. In order to treat the future as seriously as we treat the past, we clearly need an alternative to the Newtonian Schema.</p>\r\n<div class=\"reco\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 38px; padding: 25px 0px; border-width: 1px 0px; border-image: initial; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border-color: #d8d8d8 initial #d8d8d8 initial; border-style: solid initial solid initial;\">\r\n<article class=\"issue-article\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">\r\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; float: left;\"><a class=\"obnd_lnk\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: black;\" href=\"https://nautil.us/issue/64/The%20Unseen/the-end-of-time\" data-trval=\"the-end-of-time\" data-trlbl=\"foc_rec\" data-tract=\"internal_art\"><img style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; margin: 0px 18px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\" src=\"http://static.nautil.us/15243_2e310f292c162dece16e5936ffde36e8.jpg\" alt=\"Sapolsky_TH-F1\" width=\"314\" height=\"177\" /></a></div>\r\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span class=\"article-tag\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 2px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline-block; letter-spacing: 0.1em; text-transform: uppercase;\"><span class=\"article-tag\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 2px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline-block; letter-spacing: 0.1em;\"><span class=\"article-tag-focus\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-weight: 400;\"><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; vertical-align: baseline; color: black; font-weight: 600;\" href=\"https://nautil.us/term/f/Physics\">ALSO IN PHYSICS</a></span>  </span></span>\r\n<h4 class=\"article-title\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000;\"><a class=\"obnd_lnk\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; display: block;\" href=\"https://nautil.us/issue/64/The%20Unseen/the-end-of-time\" data-trval=\"the-end-of-time\" data-trlbl=\"foc_rec\" data-tract=\"internal_art\">The End of Time</a></h4>\r\n<p class=\"article-author\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 31px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\">By Carlo Rovelli</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; line-height: 21px; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\">Perhaps God has many more seasonsin store for us—or perhaps the last is to bethis winterthat guides back the wavesof the Tyrrhenian Seato break againstthe rough pumice cliffs.You must be wise.

Most physicists are well aware of a different framework, an alternative where space and time are analyzed in an even-handed manner. This so-called Lagrangian Schema also has old roots and has become an essential tool in every field of fundamental physics. But even physicists who regularly use this approach have resisted the last obvious step: thinking of the Lagrangian Schema not just as a mathematical trick, but as a way to explain the world. Perhaps we haven’t been taking our own theories seriously enough.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">The Lagrangian Schema doesn’t just allow future-based explanations.

This can best be done by treating spacetime regions holistically: considering the full duration all at once, rather than as sequential frames of a movie. We can picture regions of spacetime as bounded four-dimensional structures, with not just spatial boundaries, but also temporal boundaries—the initial and final bookends of the region.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">All of classical physics, from electricity to black holes, can be expressed via the simple Lagrangian-based principle of “least-action.” To use it on a spacetime region, you first describe how physical parameters are constrained over the entire boundary. Then, for each set of possible events inside that boundary, you calculate a quantity called the “action.” The set of events with the lowest value of the action is the one that will actually occur, given the original boundary constraints and a few other technical caveats.</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; quotes: none; color: #222222; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 40px 0px 50px -15px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; border: 0px; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 32px; line-height: 41px; font-family: freight-display-pro, Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 694.438px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #999999; position: relative;\">It is hard to accept that events might be explained by what goes on in the future.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">For instance, when a ray of light travels from point A to point B, the action corresponds to the amount of travel time. The actual path is the fastest route, given the intermediate obstacles. By this way of thinking, a light ray bends at a glass interface simply because it minimizes the overall travel time. The Lagrangian Schema works a bit differently in quantum physics and yields probabilities rather than decisive predictions, but the basics are the same: Spacetime boundary constraints are still imposed all at once.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">By Newtonian logic, this sounds quite strange. The light ray at A seems to possess foreknowledge (about point B and future obstacles), vast computational ability (to survey the different paths), and agency (to choose the fastest one). But this strangeness is merely evidence that Newtonian and Lagrangian thinking don’t mesh—and that we probably shouldn’t anthropomorphize light rays.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Instead of explaining events via only the past, the Lagrangian Schema starts with the entire boundary constraint—including, crucially, the final boundary. If you don’t impose a final constraint—for light rays, the location of point B—this approach fails to give the proper answer. But if used properly, the success of the mathematics indicates a clear logical priority of the boundary constraint: The boundary of any spacetime region explains the interior.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">The Lagrangian approach provides the most elegant and flexible account of known physics, and physicists often prefer it. Still, despite the wide applicability of Lagrangian-based principles, even the physicists who use them don’t take them literally. It is hard to accept that events might be explained by what goes on in the future. After all, there are obvious distinctions between past and future. Given that we see such an evident arrow of time, how could future boundaries possibly matter just as much as past ones?</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">But there’s a way to reconcile the Lagrangian Schema with our causal experience.

Each ray of light obeys the least-action principle, giving a perfectly time-symmetric account of its path. But taken together, there’s an obvious asymmetry: The initial boundaries A are all clustered together at the flash, while the final boundaries B are spread out over the statue. Furthermore, it’s perfectly clear that the spreading of light from A is a much better explanation of the illumination at B than vice-versa. Even if the ray paths were viewed in reverse, no one would plausibly claim that the light was concentrated at the flashbulb because of complex patterns of light on the statue.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">One lesson here is that satisfying explanations account for complicated events in terms of simple givens.

Even in the Lagrangian Schema, A and B are not independent of each other. To see how they’re related, we need to think bigger. According to the boundary framework of the Lagrangian Schema, explanations don’t chain. They nest. In other words, we don’t picture event A leading to event B leading to event C. Instead, we treat a small spacetime region in its entirety; then we treat this region as part of a larger region (in both space and time). Applying the same Lagrangian logic, the larger boundaries should now explain everything in their interior, including the original boundaries.</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; quotes: none; color: #222222; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 40px 0px 50px -15px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; border: 0px; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 32px; line-height: 41px; font-family: freight-display-pro, Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 694.438px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #999999; position: relative;\">If the future can constrain the past, why are the consequences confined to the quantum level?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Running this procedure for the statue example, we find the same asymmetry of bulb and illumination writ larger. That is, we find a satisfying explanation for the camera flash in its past, but we don’t explain the illumination of the statue by looking to its future. Then we can enclose that larger system in an even bigger one, and so on, until we have gone all the way out to the cosmological boundary—the external constraints on our entire universe. To the best of our knowledge, we see the same asymmetry at that scale: an unusual, smooth distribution of matter near the big bang, and greater disorder in the future.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Looking at ordinary spacetime regions from a Lagrangian perspective, the fact that initial boundaries (light rays diverging from flashbulbs) are simpler than final boundaries (lit statues) is strong evidence that our closest cosmological boundary lies to our past. The consistency of this ordering implies there is no corresponding cosmological boundary in the comparable future. So given the big bang as our best explanation of the obvious features of our universe, the evident direction of time is essentially no different from the spatial temperature gradient you feel when standing next to a cold window. In neither case is space or time asymmetric; it’s just a matter of where you are located relative to the nearest boundary constraint.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">On the classical scales that we typically observe, we don’t get any new information from the future boundary that we didn’t already have in the past. If this held true at all scales, the Lagrangian Schema would be in trouble, because the future boundary wouldn’t really matter at all. But in fact it isn’t true when we get down to the level of quantum uncertainty: Microscopic future details cannot be deduced from only the past. And the quantum scale is where the real power of the Lagrangian Schema becomes evident.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"breaker-image\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 30px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #222222; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" data-alt=\"Wharton_BR-3\" data-title=\"A TANGLED TALE\" data-capper=\"In a standard quantum-entanglement experiment, pairs of particles are emitted by a source and measured by detectors.

The details don’t matter for our purposes, so let’s consider the skeletal outline of a typical entanglement experiment (see A Tangled Tale). The apparatus in the center creates two particles. The left particle is sent to a detector controlled by one computer (“Alice”), and the right particle is sent to a distant detector controlled by another computer (“Bob”). The detectors measure their respective particles in one of several different ways, decided by independent random numbers. As the Irish physicist John Bell famously demonstrated in the ’60s, the measurement results of these experiments are correlated in ways that firmly resist our usual attempts at explanation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">In particular, the particles’ shared past isn’t sufficient to explain the measured correlations, at least not over the full range of measurement settings that Alice and Bob could randomly choose. Of course, many scientists <i style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">want</i> to explain these results physically and aren’t particularly happy with merely describing the correlations via bare mathematics. Left at a loss, they find themselves invoking mysterious entities not properly existing anywhere in space or time (begging for an explanation in their own right) or perhaps even traveling faster than light (in blatant violation of everything we know about Einstein’s theory of relativity).</p>\r\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; quotes: none; color: #222222; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 40px 0px 50px -15px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 15px; border: 0px; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 32px; line-height: 41px; font-family: freight-display-pro, Georgia, \'Times New Roman\', serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 694.438px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #999999; position: relative;\">Why can’t we use quantum phenomena to send messages into the past?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Leaving these desperate options aside, everyone agrees that if only the particles could anticipate Alice’s and Bob’s random settings in advance, a natural explanation could still be found. But most proposals to give the particles this information sound even more desperate, requiring what amounts to a form of cheating: The particles would somehow sniff out all the inputs to Alice’s and Bob’s random number generators and use that information to predict the future detector settings.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Almost no one buys this as a worthwhile explanation of the entanglement experiments, just as you wouldn’t accept an “explanation” of a localized camera flash as being due to the complicated details of a lit statue.

For quantum entanglement, when using the Lagrangian viewpoint, a reasonable explanation is nearly as obvious. The explanation is not in the complex precursors to the detector settings, it’s in the simple future detector settings themselves.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">The mysterious entangled particles exist in the shaded spacetime region in the figure, and the boundary of this region includes both their preparation and their eventual detection. The settings chosen by Alice and Bob are physically expressed by the actual detectors, on the final boundary—exactly where the Lagrangian Schema tells us to look for explanations. All we need to do is allow the particles to be directly constrained by that future boundary and a simple explanation of entanglement experiments becomes available. In this case, it’s the future and the past together that can best explain the observations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\"><span class=\"dropcap mqw\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 2px solid black; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 80px; line-height: 68px; vertical-align: baseline; float: left; text-align: center; position: relative; top: 9px; color: #ffb618; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75); min-width: 80px; height: 80px; text-transform: uppercase;\">Q</span>uantum entanglement may not be the only mystery that we can dissolve by taking the future seriously as an explanation. Other quantum phenomena may also turn out to have an underlying simpler account, an explanation that could reside in ordinary space and time without any action at a distance. Maybe the probabilities in quantum theory will turn out to be like probabilities in every other scientific discipline: simply due to parameters that we don’t know (because some of them lie in the future).</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Any such line of research will certainly raise significant questions. If the future can constrain the past, why are the consequences confined to the quantum level? Why can’t we use quantum phenomena to send messages into the past? At what scales does the cosmological boundary dominate, and how exactly should we generalize Lagrangian-based approaches to make this all work?</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Addressing such questions might not just help physics; it might also inform how we see ourselves as part of our four-dimensional universe. For example, according to the Lagrangian Schema, microscopic details in any region are not entirely constrained by the past boundary. On the level of the atoms in your brain, there are relevant but unknown constraints in the future. Perhaps this line of thinking could even help to explain our sense of free will, by providing a new sense in which the future is not purely determined by what has come before. Certainly it would require us to rethink the idea that there is a neat and objective difference between a fixed past and an open future.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; font-family: freight-sans-pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style-position: inside; width: 716.375px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; color: #222222;\">Almost every time science has found a deeper, simpler, more satisfying explanation, it has led to a cascade of further scientific advances. So if there is a deeper account of quantum phenomena that we haven’t yet grasped, mastering that deeper level could lead to crucial advances in the vast array of technologies that utilize quantum effects. Mistaken instincts have certainly slowed past physics advances, and our instincts about time are as strong as they come. But there is a clear path forward to explaining some of nature’s deepest mysteries, if we can simply make ourselves look to the future.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 25px;

Records are being smashed in terms of death tolls, especially in areas of the world where large numbers of people took the injections.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">In Scotland, for instance, the government recently logged the 20th consecutive week in which excess deaths throughout the country have exceeded the five-year average. This is in a country with an 87 percent jab compliance rate so far.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">“Even excluding Covid deaths they were almost 20% above normal for the most recent week, and the trend is rising,” relayed Alex Berenson on his Substack.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Germany is in a similar quagmire with nearly 78,000 reported excess deaths, a figure 10 percent higher than what was expected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">“Mortality figures (in Germany) in September 2021: 10% above the median of previous years,” Berenson added.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555;\">More young people are dying from covid jabs than old people</h2>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">In Denmark, Finland and Norway, “mystery” covid deaths are currently higher than ever before, even during the “worst” of the <i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">plandemic</i>. The deaths really started spiking in these three countries immediately following the “vaccine” rollout.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">For five months in a row, Denmark has shattered the 10-year record of people dying from “all causes.” Meanwhile, there have been basically zero deaths caused by “covid” during this time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Ireland, the United Kingdom and Israel are all posting similar alarming figures.

One would think that the opposite would be true.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">“While the COVID death toll has been largely confined to the elderly … it’s the young who are bearing the brunt of vaccine injury,” reported <i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">LifeSiteNews</i>, as relayed by <i style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Unz</i>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">“According to VigiAccess, the adverse event database for the World Health Organization, 41% of the more than 2.4 million vaccine injuries reported so far are among those under age 44, and just six percent are among people over age 75.”</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">It is a genocide of the young that is taking place with these injections, in other words.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Not only deaths but also serious injuries are on the rise from these injections.

The evidence is all circumstantial. But it is compelling, all the same. For example, rising mortality isn’t just happening in Scotland.

A 13-year-old soccer player form the Janus Nova club in Saccolongo Italy also collapsed right on the field. Belgian soccer player, Jente Van Genechten (25) went into cardiac arrest in a cup game. Another Belgian soccer player named Jens De Smet (27) died in the hospital after suffering from a heart attack, mid-game.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The list of sudden adult death is exhaustive and includes trainers and referees. One game was abandoned because a referee went into cardiac arrest in Lauber SV in the Donauworth district. An assistant referee collapsed with heart problems at a game in Emersacker. A goalkeeping coach from SV Niederporing had a heart attack at a training session. During a team training, 53-year-old coach Antonello Campus collapsed in Sicily. An English line judge had to be carted off with heart problems at the World Cup qualification match for women in Chemnitz.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">The <em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Covid Blog</em> documents <a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #3366cc;\" href=\"https://thecovidblog.com/2021/11/05/hollywood-athletes-suffering-more-post-injection-trauma-as-censorship-and-propaganda-pick-up-steam/\">several other cases of young athletes dying</a> suddenly in the United States. <a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #3366cc;\" href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/d956a34f-9691-4426-a062-e40227110619\">Watch this video</a> to catch a glimpse of what’s going on.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"> </p>\r\n<h2 style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555;\">Spike proteins were designed to cause inflammation in the cardiovascular system</h2>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #555555; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Young athletes who aren’t at risk from a natural infection are continuously being coerced to take experimental mRNA spike protein vaccines in order to keep their careers. The spike protein encoded in people’s cells was designed to kill red blood cells by hampering their ability to transport oxygen. The spike proteins have also been shown to cause clumping in the blood, leading to blood clots.

Forced vaccination with an experimental \"for emergency use only\" shot has precipitated death or injury for over 500,000 Americans.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p>Is this really happening? Are you sure this isn\'t 1938 Nazi Germany, or a communist country that provides no civil or human rights to its citizens? Because this can\'t be America.</p>\r\n<p>That figure of over 500,000 total deaths, serious injuries and adverse effects linked to the COVID-19 vaccines is not from me ... it\'s not from some wild, unreliable internet rumor ... it comes from the vaccine adverse event reporting system called VAERS that\'s connected to the U.S. government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s more deaths and injuries than all the vaccines in the past three decades combined, by a mile. By the way, throughout history, VAERS has always underreported deaths and injuries by a wide margin.</p>\r\n<p>In the European Union, the same vaccine reporting system reports over 20,000 dead and over 2 million injured by the vaccines.</p>\r\n<p>But the media has blacked out the deaths and injuries from the vaccines like they\'re an image of underage sex on Hunter Biden\'s laptop. Facts that destroy the government agenda scare the media to death.</p>\r\n<p>What if all of this were happening and former President Donald Trump were serving his second term? The exact same vaccines, the exact same results. Just imagine with me.</p>\r\n<p>What if Trump were president and the government swore the vaccines would prevent COVID-19, but when the vaccinated started getting sick, the goal post was changed 180 degrees? Suddenly, everyone admits the vaccinated are getting COVID-19 and they can spread it, too. Suddenly their viral load is as high as unvaccinated people\'s. Suddenly the vaccines aren\'t effective against \"variants.\" Suddenly its only use is in preventing hospitalizations. Talk about three-card Monte.</p>\r\n<p>But do COVID-19 vaccines actually prevent hospitalizations? In Israel, doctors report as many as 95% of patients hospitalized are vaccinated. If Trump were president, would anyone be getting vaccinated anymore after hearing those numbers? Would any Democrat? Would any black American?</p>\r\n<p>How about closer to home? In Massachusetts, there are 9,969 \"breakthrough cases\" of vaccinated people with COVID-19, and over 100 vaccinated people are dead of COVID-19. That\'s reported by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</p>\r\n<p>But those are just COVID-19 deaths among the vaccinated. That has nothing to do with the deaths and serious injuries tied to the COVID-19 vaccines themselves.</p>\r\n<p>If Trump were president, the media would be reporting those numbers in gigantic headlines and calling \"Trump\'s vaccine\" a \"Frankenstein\'s monster.\" They\'d be accusing Trump of murder. They\'d be calling him \"Hitler.\"</p>\r\n<p>Not one Democrat in America would be taking these vaccines.</p>\r\n<p>There would be Black Lives Matter riots as black Americans accused Trump of racism and genocide. The American Civil Liberties Union would be filing lawsuits in every city, county and state in America. They\'d call forced vaccinations under Trump \"the civil rights issue of our lifetime.\"</p>\r\n<p>And the children? Are you aware Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (the most respected in the world) just did a study of 45,000 American kids with COVID-19 and found zero deaths among healthy children? Zero as in zero. Only a handful of children in all of America died from COVID-19, and Johns Hopkins reports all of them had childhood cancer.</p>\r\n<p>So, if Trump were president and the government demanded every schoolchild be masked and vaccinated with a dangerous and sometimes deadly experimental vaccine, even though there was zero risk of death from this flu bug, what would liberals say? How about feminist mothers?</p>\r\n<p>You don\'t have to guess. I know. Liberal mothers across America would say, \"Trump wants to murder our children.\"</p>\r\n<p>But most importantly, looking at the VAERS numbers shows thousands dead and over 500,000 injured, many seriously, in connection to this experimental jab. If Trump were president, doctors and medical experts would be demanding an immediate suspension of this vaccine program. The media would be touting \"Trump vaccine deaths\" on the front page.</p>\r\n<p>If Trump were president, no Democrat would take the jab. Would anyone be calling for their freedoms to be taken away, or their lives to be destroyed? What if Trump wanted to put Democrats on a no-fly list?</p>\r\n<p>This is madness and insanity. This is the definition of intolerance. This is something I\'d expect in Nazi Germany or a communist dictatorship. This is an India-like caste system for the 90 million Americans who don\'t want the vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>But Trump isn\'t president. So, everything happening is hunky-dory. Just move along, there\'s nothing to see here.</p>\r\n<p>And anyone who disagrees can be censored, banned, demonized, fired, bankrupted and sent to prison, or reeducation camp.</p>\r\n<p>This is what the end of America looks like.</p>\r\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"https://www.creators.com/read/wayne-allyn-root/08/21/if-trump-were-president-not-one-democrat-in-america-would-be-vaccinated\">https://www.creators.com/read/wayne-allyn-root/08/21/if-trump-were-president-not-one-democrat-in-america-would-be-vaccinated</a> </p>', '1', '150', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '82', '', '2022-08-16 05:16:47', '82', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2021-10-28 07:34:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"info_block_show_title\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_associations\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_page_title\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\",\"spfeatured_image\":\"images\\/2021\\/10\\/31\\/1f4a9b013f65def7ed82424a3973e1677824d8c3.jpg\",\"spfeatured_image_alt\":\"\",\"post_format\":\"standard\",\"gallery\":\"\",\"audio\":\"\",\"video\":\"\",\"link_title\":\"\",\"link_url\":\"\",\"quote_text\":\"\",\"quote_author\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"\"}', '18', '45', '', '', '1', '62', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', '*', '', ''),
